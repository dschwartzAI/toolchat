.3 million us at the time then I did that again and then I did it again and the formula to this day works the formula of having a very high margin coaching training Consulting product that shows someone how to get a defined result over a defined time period that's sold for5 plus th000 via the telephone if you want the absolute fastest way to grow start and grow a profitable coaching Consulting business in 2025 the answer has been the same for about 8 years do that that is the fastest way because what you will do is have the highest margin product and as long as you f the product to the market you will have demand for it you as long as you can have a promise that people want they want to make money they want a better body a better relationship a better life whatever it may be there's only four categories I've covered them many times look out the videos make money save money live a better life or stay at a jail you got to be selling in one of those categories the absolute fastest way to sell that is on the telephone the absolute fastest way is to get people on the phone understand their current state understand the gap between the current state and their desired future State present your program as the desired future State and and then get their money and then put them in something that's high leverage to deliver you can get to multiple six figures a month doing that if you spend every waking hour hustling posting content to get people on the phone you get them on the phone and you sell 40% to 50% of those people into that product you'll make a ton of money you'll get some of those people results depending on your skill level how experienced you are how good you are the scope of the promise Etc that's the most variables that to this day is the absolute fastest way to do it the reason I'm not doing that is that it's a young man's game and what I realized after years and years of doing that the trade-offs that have to happen in the pursuit of growth and the pursuit of money are not trade-offs that I'm prepared to make so nowadays I have programs with defined promises I have a mentorship program that has no promises whatsoever it just allow people to look over my shoulder and share insights with them and and give them office hours a couple of times we where they can ask me questions it doesn't have a single promise in the world it's solded via a Google doc I will not get on a call I will only get on a call with people who invest in consulting or I've invested in them in terms of taking them as a coaching client and commitment or they're in The Syndicate and part of the mentorship and the reason that the call based system as a as a young man's game is requires a lot of energy and a lot of time and at my stage of life I have two children both of them over there right now I have two dogs both of them over there right now I have another child on the way I have a wonderful relationship I love to travel I love to do absolutely nothing for long periods of time I love to stuff around I'm wearing these clothes cuz I'm about to go on an hourong walk and listen to a podcast before our Chef arrives and cook and and Cooks us dinner tonight I don't want to be on the telephone all the time I want to spend time doing those things I want to spend time with the kids I want to spend time swing my pool I want to spend time chasing the dogs on the beach I want to spend time with my soon to be new wife and the the the young man's game is the fastest way to make money because you can deploy a lot of energy into it you can get people on the phone you can hustle you can grind you can do all those things and you make a ton of money and you might want to keep doing that or you might want to take it to the next level where you start hiring people you build a sales team to sell that you

# workshop Framework

## Overview

The workshop is a comprehensive framework for business transformation.

## Complete Framework

because those outcomes are a bu product of the action and the work that people ultimately do so selling supposedly intangible things becomes very simple when you point at things that they are buying you point at incentives that they have to to do it right now and you point at ultimately the distinct outcomes that they have and those outcomes monetary outcomes are are easy for people to Value but outcomes that are behavioral or or that show up in people's lives so you can have more intimacy every day be become much more tangible than these generic ideas every offer can be made tangible it just requires a little bit of looking and and know stepping back from the mixing up of the of the correlation and the causation of the work that you do I personally help people make money they do the work and they they get the outcomes and they get the benefits and they use that money to do things you know which is the a lot of the other stuff I talk about they do use that money to live a better life but at the end of the day I point at the outcomes I point the mechanism and I point at the things that that people can see and value and that works no matter what you sell What's Working in 2025 To Get High Ticket Clients I ran my first Facebook ad in 2017 so I guess I'm a veteran back in the back in the day when you were own a Facebook ad you could get a booked call and sell someone a very expensive you know Consulting program for about 50 in the time New Zealand dollars so you could run an ad get someone to a vsl convince them that you knew what you were talking about understand what they needed prove prove that you understand what they needed get them on a call and sell them a $22 to $10,000 Consulting program and people still do that to this day and it doesn't cost $50 anymore and everybody I talked to who still runs core funnels and still runs ads to them always report costs going up the only exception in this and one of the biggest Moes that people have these days is someone with a brand if you've got a large person brand a large brand on YouTube or on Instagram or one of those where people are pre-sold on you then you book a core funnels and these things still really work most people don't have a large personal brand Everybody's Got a Brand but most people don't have a large manufactured intentional personal brand and so in 2025 you are steering into the headwinds of a low trust environment the fact is that lots of people have been making lots of big bold crazy in many cases unrealistic promises and we are in a low trust environment and back 10 years ago just your Boomer parents would believe every sing single thing on the news people believed every single thing they saw on the internet and they bought the claims they bought the promises and they bought into everything and you know you could pretty much sell anything these days we are in a very low trust environment and that means the the marketing and the force that people are putting into marketing to try and convince people of those things is a it's less effective because we're in a low trust environment and B there's just way more people doing it so the the the signal to noise ratio has changed dramatically and so that brings us to the present day so 24 hours ago I ran a workshop and on that Workshop ironically I showed people my workshop process of how I sell Workshop tickets for $100 and how I generate multiple thousand High ticket customers off the back of that and one of the things that we did in the Q&A so we went for about 2 and a half hours and about half of that is teaching and about half of that is just Q&A where I just help people one of the things I said in that environment is that we have to give people an experience the days are are are they're not gone but they're coming to an end where people will be nurtured through a multi step funnel where they'll see lots and lots of pieces of content and eventually

. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems. But don't go over the top. James Kemp: and with pricing is there a clear roi? Have you made it easy to get started? And I've done that by giving you the prescriptions of the pricing? James Kemp: And does your price factor in the cost of inaction? Have you just made it really easy to get started as the primary model? And again. this. I'm laboring this because it's a massive failure point. James Kemp: No one wants to watch 54 videos and intend 10 h of calls a week the better the client, and, the more money they have, the less time they have James Kemp: right, because more offers fail because they are indigestible rather than Lane James Kemp: telling people what's in it., all the things they get is more likely to kill demand than enhance it. Again, it's a common failure point that I see in products and offers that people are talking about all the stuff they get. James Kemp: and in and a desire to overwhelm them with value. James Kemp: And it's lazy, because if you have a clear promise and a plan, people don't need to know all the value you you deliver, they just need to get, be clear about it, so they can say yes and get started. James Kemp: So is to get some examples to bring these things together. Your next task is to construct an offer using a simple Google Doc James Kemp: syndicate folks, 95% of you should have one right now. So the reason we use a Google Doc as far as it's fast to create James Kemp: and to share and to modify. And it's most useful to demonstrate James Kemp: by examples. And I've got a template for you here as well. James Kemp: so this is an example from Jason and Janine. James Kemp: and it talks clearly about the promise James Kemp: and the plan. So the promise is. James Kemp: do you want support for me, and my incredible, incredible community can install a system that can can James Kemp: consistently attracts 5 prospects every month, securing at least one high value client every single month on your terms with the visibility you deserve, and without becoming stuck in the frustration of being the best kept secret. James Kemp: so clearly, clearly, clearly articulates what happens right? It uses numbers. It uses currency to clearly say. James Kemp: this is what's going to happen. This is what you get, and these are things you can point at James Kemp: it clearly, says that it's a 12 month program. but then it comes into over the next 6 weeks. James Kemp: and it talks about the plan will develop your client roadmap so you can. So you are faster. James Kemp: So your laser focused on who you work with. And more importantly, they'll want to work with you right? James Kemp: Then we install your product roadmap James Kemp: very clear. No cuteness. Just the client roadmap, the product roadmap, and then the IP generator system. James Kemp: So it's a great example James Kemp: of being very, very clear about the promise and the plan. and again distilling it down and removing any superfluous bits around the core. Right? Everything else in there is a benefit James Kemp: but the core James Kemp: clearly clearly articulated in the promise as something desirable, and the plan that future paces people to go through. James Kemp: This is what sales offers. James Kemp: If someone is clear that those are the things they want, and they agree with the plan. James Kemp: they are very, very, very likely to want to get started when the price meets the expectation. James Kemp: and again the pricing I've given you, will meet the expectation

that you've done y but you can follow the sequence there cuz I followed a similar sequence I got 161 :23 to1 clients at 12 bucks a week yeah and I did that for 4 months and that's all I did and I was in safety because I was :31 making enough money and I was fine and I had Consulting revenue from other things on the side and I was :36 offloading some other things that were still making money but I was offloading those to reduce the stress :42 because I knew on the other side of the 16 that then I'd add a community and then I made a slight tweak to the one to :48 one which I went from the the same model that you're running which is this is how many calls you get to to variable :54 calls on Demand right which is and that dropped the call volume by 40% which created more capacity but I still didn't :01 raise the number of one to one clients because I'm cool I can get capacity back time and energy to scale but all :07 along the way the hidden thing for me was I only do calls on Tuesday and Thursday so I don't feel stressed :14 whatsoever but because I put put constraints on what I was prepared to do :20 and unprepared to do in terms of feeding those things in so that also I think that helps in not getting caught up with :26 the the nonsense that people have of this is one to one is it scalable is it could questioning the :32 modality when really if you just do calls on Tuesday and Thursday I had an unusually heavy day yesterday did seven :38 calls right and it was that's okay what have I done today yeah come here :44 and talk to you and I went went to breath work and but it's the the sequence I think the thing that :51 people don't miss is that time Dimension that you can go through that sequence really quickly whereas someone listening :56 to this might need to do do that over 3 to four years Y and last note on this before we talk about funnel is sometimes :03 it's not even about logic it's about emotion in the positive sense right can we both double our business by doing :11 nothing else and just growing the things we have yes yes do we want to do other things because it sounds fun yes and so :18 did I need to add an in-person events for my community sell I don't think I did but it sounds fun I'm :24 in La next month running an event I'm in Japan in March running an event that sounds fun and so this is where it's :30 also not about need oh but do we need it's you can get to a point if you have high recurring Revenue High :36 profit low stress you don't have to be super strategic and everything have to be logical you can simply do stuff just :42 cuz you want to do it yeah I'll share this because it's been amusing for me I :49 I have not taken any PID PID and Fs this year really and I controversial I I I do :57 with partner offers CU 20K up front and it's a it's a chunk of work cuz I'm co-writing co-creating an offer with :03 someone but there is no pay plan because we just get straight into it and that's a particular type of type of partnership :09 but for my scalable coaching Consulting I've not taken a :16 painful every month I've increased Revenue by at least 14 to 20% my :23 recurring Revenue proportion is over 80% of monthly Revenue so I'm by all :28 and I'm and I made six figures profit this month M didn't quite make six figures last month but I will this month :34 and by every conceivable metric is going up but it's boring yeah isn't that isn't :41 that weird to say that I felt a couple of times of that grind up of just watching the everything just go up

[ __ ] stressful it was unbelievably stressful but it's in those moments where you're what do I really want to do who do I really want to be and was that clear to you at that time or is that something that was evolving no not at all I think in hindsight the North Star has always been the tinkering piece making something putting it out there I was always a top performer in sales because I'd always be interested in the person an interest in the psychology of what I was saying what was coming across the dynamic the relationship and those things and I think the next thing that I did I was sitting at home one night watching everything crumble and I emailed a startup in London called living social so Groupon and living social have both come onto the market a daily deals market and then just exploded into this thing because local businesses could use them to get customers which is notoriously difficult right and I emailed the general manager who they'd come to London they had about four or five people and he said can you be in central London at eight o'clock the next morning it's yeah it was a response that do an email at 11 o'clock at night got there got the job on the spot and then 16 months later there were 350 people they've been funded with 800 Million by Amazon I was in the middle of another thing which was all about making lots of offers right and and but in the online space this is fascinating because I don't even know this stuff I know I know the New Zealand Origins yeah I didn't quite know the UK stuff and so at this time was I'm fascinated because most entrepreneurs have the story of I was born an entrepreneur I was unemployable I kept getting fired from places that doesn't seem it's your story I'm sure there were moments of this is hard I would rather be doing my own thing but were apart from the tinkering was was Freedom autonomy sovereignty was that a big part of the value set at that point or did that come over time as you're exposed to more the online space and people talking about it yeah it was only after Max was born so max is my son it's only after Max was born that I started to look at them environment we're in and not one to not want to have children in the in the system the type of things that we call them that we maybe not say out loud the consequence of what I did became much more real yeah that it wasn't just me and I could float through and it didn't matter if I maybe did things that were compromising values working in an industry that keeps people in debt didn't matter right there's no consequence it was I was making money who cares yeah yeah but after he was born I was looking at what we are in in the system yeah in terms of the system of society and especially in Western society and I was okay you need to have options yeah and the belief that has never gone away is true freedom is Downstream of Financial Freedom yeah so you can make a lot of impact and all these words the buzzwords but unless you've got choices yeah you can't really get to True Freedom and people can throw around what that means to them and it is very personal but it was until Max was born that I really thought I need to cultivate an environment where I'm living in something that gives some choices yeah because of that sense that the world's not going to be the same and if it's the same as it is now then I'd rather plot an alternative course right around it yeah I I feel I didn't even have a work ethic until I got married and especially when I had my first kid Brooklyn seven years ago that was when I felt was I found another gear I was oh okay I the stakes are higher especially because my wife and I for most of our 20s were working for the church we were broke but we were it was a mutually we both decided we were going to be broke and so neither one of us was resentful or bitter it was we're

# offering Framework - Complete Guide & delivery Framework - Complete Guide

# offering Framework

## Overview

I'll leave you with an offering system that you can run every single month James Kemp: with.

## Complete Framework

., so, there is no upper limit. But the promise is very manageable and very measurable for someone who's got, just some basic things that I can work with. James Kemp: you understand? Over 12 weeks we install in cash flow one client offer generating at least 10 K. In sales. James Kemp: Right? It's binary. James Kemp: If you don't want that James Kemp: right fine, it's you don't need that right now. You don't benefit from it. You don't see the benefit from it, etc. James Kemp: It is easy to say no to not either. That's not my priority right now. I need more leads or no., I'm already at 7 figures, and 10 K, is my coffee bill for next month. Right? So it's it's it's it's right in the pocket of relevance of someone who's a good fit for me and the syndicate, who's probably at between 10 and 30 KA month, who's looking to reorganize things and make them more stable and more efficient. James Kemp: And then I go into a little bit of why offers are important, and then we unpack, and we future pace what happens. James Kemp: So get clear on your ideal market and co-create a client, offer to get some results within the minimum of you. James Kemp: We use a hybrid office, or I insert a mechanism into there and then, in phase 2. I explain what cash flowing is. Right. So we cash flow the offer and work to tap on these new clients. I'll leave you with an offering system that you can run every single month James Kemp: with. I'll talk about ascension and pricing, and how we do it in a moment. If someone buys this and they stay with me for 13 weeks and they go off happy. Then I'm happy if someone buys this, and they stay with me for 13 weeks, and they stay in the syndicate and then stay with me forever. I'm happy. The result delivers. James Kemp: no matter what. There is not holding anything back from the future. The offer is the offer, and it's designed to get the result James Kemp: right, and then again reiterate that. So what we do together, I reiterate what gets done, how it works. So I front load the delivery of these. So we get on a 1 to one call. We do the offer. There's probably a small amount of homework for the people to go for the person to go away with, and then I drop them into the infrastructure I've already got. So that person gets access to the syndicate calls, gets access to the trainings, etc. James Kemp: So again, that's a benefit. James Kemp: That's not the core proposition of the offer. But once they're in, as with, people are coming to the syndicate calls and says, Well, I want to stick around. I this group, etc, etc. Then they go James Kemp: the investment I'll talk about. I use pay as you profit in a few different ways. I'll talk about this in more detail in a moment. But. James Kemp: this James Kemp: template covers. I don't use this pricing right now. But this one is 5 K. Now 5 K. When we hit 10 k. Of sales. James Kemp: and I put the pay plan secondary. So I'll let you finance the initial 5 K. Over 12 weeks at 500 per week. James Kemp: Then I have a qualifier. You're probably doing these things. You're probably dissatisfied with this. You have these things right? James Kemp: And we are more defined. James Kemp: What about who we don't work with and who we do

# delivery Framework

## Overview

If you focus on delivery, then have a system to distribute it, you'll get the best results.

## Complete Framework

. Solve a single problem, deliver a single result. Sell them what they want, give them what they need. I trick my clients into coming by making it sound more fun. I'm a big proponent of selling the next thing, making it sound great, but delivering what they need. Magic pills sell. Frame it magically while staying ethical. If you're experienced, you can take more risks testing new ideas. I believe people's time is precious. Repurposing something you're confident about and giving it a new frame is the best way to deliver. I've delivered workshops about workshops 3 times. I find new things, so I reteach. Remember they're a small sum of the larger part. I can't help you build a sovereign business in this workshop. There's a bigger piece. Three types of workshops: demonstration (show what's working, give them the things that work), model (show the overall model, give them a plan), and mechanism (help them use the mechanism to get a result). Demonstration: show what's working, why it works, give them the things that work, and let them replicate. I want people to copy me. Model: show the overall model, give them a plan, help them envisage theirs. Mechanism: help them use the mechanism to get a result. Traffic to your sales page is warm. You don't need long sales pages. Short, punchy, bullet-pointed pages work best. The more you give to sell, the more objections. Put logistical details on the sales page. Content pre-sells the sales page. 3-7 day promotion periods work well. Most people run out of things to say before 7 days. Content builds context. By the time they get to the sales page, they're sold on the context. Your workshop depends on your delivery method. Some do slides, workbooks, docs, straight to camera. I docs because they help me think. Delivery has two parts: the vehicle (document, slides) and the conversation (Q&A). Insight can happen during or after. The replay goes into the community. If they don't join, they get it on an ungated page. Ungated means it's pirated, but it works in your favor long-term. How do you get clients? The key metric is the number of offers you make. Insert the offer briefly but carefully. Client offers convert better when offered to customers. Workshops convert better than webinars. It's easier to sell to someone who's bought before. Five touch points: 24 hours and 60 minutes before, beginning, end, and replay. If you offer a call, that's a fifth touch point. The more offers you make, the more clients you get. Three common mistakes: building a workshop a webinar, building a workshop to sell (leaving pieces out), and creating workshops when desperate for clients. Even if you don't have clients, run a workshop for an imaginary client. Focus on delivery. Results are created long-term. Good results come from giving good insights, teaching, and experiences. If you focus on delivery, then have a system to distribute it, you'll get the best results. Your marketing becomes demonstration and distribution. Most people spend 80% of their time marketing, 20% delivering. I spend 80% creating for clients, 20% productizing and monetizing. I work backwards from what clients need. There's a paradox with workshops: some of the best for clients are the worst for customers. Think about turning workshops into long-term assets the same way you think about ads. Run 10 workshops to find the one that works long-term. Judge them on three dimensions: product, delivery, and client generation. What are you focusing on? Client acquisition? Run spicy workshops that give immediate results. When upselling, send reminders 24 hours and 60 minutes before

# activating Framework

## Overview

** James Kemp advises against being wishy-washy and trying to please everyone, emphasizing the importance of a tight plan that allows people to easily say yes or no.

## Complete Framework

The promise is short-term, the vision is long-term. ## Being True to Your Fans and Embracing Discernment **Summary:** James Kemp advises against being wishy-washy and trying to please everyone, emphasizing the importance of a tight plan that allows people to easily say yes or no. He also discusses the concept of true fans and their unwavering loyalty. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Where I've been straying is not being true to the true fans. The tighter your plan, the easier it is for people to say yes or no. Most people build their business to please everyone. They're constantly thinking, "What does the market want?" Most people don't know what they want. We are articulating ideals and demonstrating. It's the handholds. "This is interesting, or this is relevant." The reticular activating system, the yellow car thing. Sack yourself. Create raving fans. The true fans are the true fans. a footy team, you don't change teams. Offers and content are invitations to pay attention. The best offers are binary. Easy yes or no. The best content is binary. Popular people have detractors because they're individualistic. You can't scale things you don't care about. The coaching industry talks about scaling volume, not scaling care. ## Distributing Your Plan and Building Trust Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp recommends sharing your plan across all platforms, regardless of whether it's a personal or business profile. He also discusses building trust and relationships through content, emphasizing total attention time and the number of insights consumed. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Should I share my plan from a personal Facebook profile or a business page? As long as you're in it, it doesn't matter. Put your plan everywhere. People can refer back to it. Is there a best content format for building trust? It's hitting the four points and letting them consume. Total attention time. People binge my content before calls. They need to consume a certain amount to get enough insight. A 20-minute YouTube video might have 7,000 words, which is about 30 emails. Both convert, but total consumption time varies. With video, you move people faster because they consume at a higher rate. We're chasing a certain number of insights. 10 insights could come from 10 Facebook posts or one YouTube video. ## Identifying Barriers to Buying and Removing Them Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of identifying barriers to buying and using content to remove those barriers. He emphasizes the value of offer creation and how it can accelerate client acquisition and retention. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** When people buy, what conditions have they met? There are natural barriers to buying. I focus on offer creation. If I help people create an offer before they become clients, I can quickly tweak it to increase their earnings. They've already done the groundwork. They think I'm a genius, but they did the work. I know what moves the needle. Getting an offer beforehand makes them more likely to become and stay a client. We've already created momentum. What do they need to get results? What do you need to give them so they see they can get the result, but are better off with you? If your content proves they're looking at a barrier the wrong way, that's insight. If it shows they have what they need but don't know how to use it, that's insight. Insight removes barriers. ## Simplifying Offers and Embracing a Scarcity Mindset **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for small, easy-to-digest offers with fewer barriers. He criticizes the scarcity mindset of withholding help and suggests aiming to help people, which naturally leads to client acquisition. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I talk about small promises
