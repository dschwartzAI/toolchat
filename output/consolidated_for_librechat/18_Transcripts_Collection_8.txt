# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 10

.com slm Mastermind and Gunning for the $150mil business I think there's more people that need to admit that to themselves that that's all they really want I've heard you allude that to that the past you talk to clients and they're they're embarrassed about their real income goals because they feel it's too small yeah yeah tell us about that how did you were you gunning for 10 you are gunning for 10 million year now but with very very small constraints on that but were you gunning for the the big $150 million business and all the employees and that eventually and how did that fall apart and and eventually reconstruct into your current goals I didn't know what I was gunning for I was gunning for something that that that gave me meaning and and got me recognition and brushed the chip on my shoulder that I've of the small boy who was never seen so I was chasing I was chasing goals because it because number on numbers on the scoreboard for a long time correlated some sense of meaning for me and then in in the time I I was married and I and I built a family and then when that came along it shifted the sense of meaning so at at at at the peak if you of a traditional model I had a team of 14 and we we were doing just under three million year at okay margins and built up the traditional model but it was all consuming and the next up level of skill acquisition of management of hiring of people development I realized would take me away from my call which was having fun and making cool with cool people so the the the game was on and I've and I've got a big skill base to go wherever I want to go with those skills and I've had teams of 25 people and you know in the middle of nine figure businesses so the game was on to to keep growing and keep scaling until life made me realized that there was life going on that was outside the computer screen and outside the the the the 9 to8 hours and there were skills I didn't want to didn't want to develop was it having kids that made you realize that yeah yeah and yeah you said that there skills I didn't want to Honing skillset and mindset develop did you have any one in your circle that you feel frowned upon you or tried to convince you to go to the next level or was there their respect for knowing what you wanted I still do I think there's I the choices I've made especially in the last 24 months a lot of my friends have large businesses a lot of my friends have large teams and a lot of my friends have secret struggles that they don't want to share with people because they they they sell that model and privately they say to me they're jealous but they also I'm not I'm not looking to invalidate anybody's idea of what a business is and or or what life is I'm just saying there's a choice about how we build it and we have to be deliberate to to decide the the things that are important to us when I started working with you I allow places to put truth on the table what do you want because we're all in these we're all in these environments where a lot of people are trying to self validate the thing that everybody else wants and they're it's that Spider-Man meme of do you you want this he you want this and everyone's pointing at each other going yeah you want this big agency with this huge team and you want the those things and then everybody's quietly turning around whispering and going this sucks the responsibility the expectations the margins the work the chase this sucks there must be a better way and I give permission Miss for people not to build businesses because very very few people want a business and all the things that are associated with it and until you've been inside these big machines where you can lose yourself you don't really appreciate what that means and a lot of people say they're building a business but what they want is enough cash flow to live a

quietly turning around whispering and going this sucks the responsibility the expectations the margins the work the chase this sucks there must be a better way and I give permission Miss for people not to build businesses because very very few people want a business and all the things that are associated with it and until you've been inside these big machines where you can lose yourself you don't really appreciate what that means and a lot of people say they're building a business but what they want is enough cash flow to live a great life and spend time with the people that are important to them and do the things they want to do whatever that may be and if we break down all the things of my model and my philosophy and those things it's that what do you want here's some tools that I've got that can help you get there and I have clients with sales teams I have clients with Setters and closers I have clients who deliver agency services and have done for you and I don't judge a single piece of that I just give them a leverage to ensure that they're doing the things that they want to be doing with the people they want to be doing it with and rewarded adequately for that The Art of Time Management yeah so much there would you say the you work quote unquote work two days a week meaning Cent work two days a week I work a lot including in my head yeah yeah you work in your head yeah on the other other times but you are talking to clients two days a week would you say that the time talking with the clients as a necessary part of hey I'm selling Consulting so this has to happen at some point or and or does that feel the art to you and what parts of what you do do you enjoy the most all of it because I see business as a creative game with a scoreboard right this thing we call business and the most effective long- lasting businesses institutions movements Etc are are rooted in ritual and creativity and and and freshness and newness of old things you know whether it's politics or religion or business it it all or art it all manifests in the same way so my goal with clients is to give them the tools that I've accumulated give them the insight about how they worked for me and then help them understand how they might work for them so they can go off and run at themselves and we can both learn something because they're not learning something from an application of and the delivery of a client then it's not interesting to me so I am infinitely curious rather than trying to gatekeep anything I'll use you as an example if I may yeah I'm not on YouTube I don't know much about YouTube in terms of an organic strategy I've seen it I've worked with people who have giant YouTube channels I work with people who spent $55 million a month on YouTube ads I've seen it all but I don't participate in it so I'm infinitely curious about when I help you build a community and start to build some coaching and Consulting offers in these pieces how you apply those to your world because if I can see the insights and they bring them into my world that makes me better and the the increase in my skill and the deployment of that skill and the more I'm prepared to let it go then makes you better and we're in a happy cycle so I don't see any of it as work I just see it as art and then the science bit the art is the creativity and the deployment of it and letting go of the ideas and that's been a that's been a two decade long mantra for me of just letting go of ideas giving them to people so we can multiply them they can multiply them and faith in the and trust in whoever you believe in on that spiritual level that the universe will will return that favor and and work in all our favores so I'm always looking for what ideas can I give people and put out there and then how can they how can they develop ideas because it if it makes if you do well with my ideas I do well from

been a two decade long mantra for me of just letting go of ideas giving them to people so we can multiply them they can multiply them and faith in the and trust in whoever you believe in on that spiritual level that the universe will will return that favor and and work in all our favores so I'm always looking for what ideas can I give people and put out there and then how can they how can they develop ideas because it if it makes if you do well with my ideas I do well from the insights that you gain from those and we all do well together yeah what a worldview wake up in the morning and it's not about how can I pad the bank account it's about how can I share and multiply ideas with cool people that I hang out with would is that a fair characterization definitely definitely and and it's from obviously it's from a place of to break the seal on that you have to trust that the Universe has you back but now it's from a place of deep Financial Comfort strong stability financially and mentally so it's easy for me to say these things but it it it it had to start from a place of if I let let my ideas go and put them out there then I be rewarded and the less expectation I had around that and the less pressure and need I had for that it's funny that the more I was rewarded for that over the long term in the in the financial scoreboard that that that does matter but can also be blinding when you're trying to manipulate it in the short term lots of people are chasing short-term results where if they allowed those results to happen then their long-term results would be would be infinitely better than they seemen to today tomorrow yeah it's so Measuring a different success interesting so sorry this is a bit of an inflection point but it just to relate back to what we're saying and then transition to the next point I read this in one of your posts recently as well as a mentoring coach I'd love to hand over the exact stepbystep template to success it doesn't exist we all measure success differently I assembled mine your path can be assembled too that's the the lie that's being sold is the opposite of that that you need to want the lambo you need to want the big house and the the refreshing breath of air air from you and others you is that that hey let's just figure it out it may be something different than you're being told it's useful to get the things I hate shs so let's talk in utility it's ful to get the things to to then validate or invalidate the idea of how how important those things are right yeah when I bought $153,000 SUV that I'd coveted and watched the YouTube reviews of and watched people drive and had the wonderful engine sound I did it so four months later I could prove to myself that that didn't make me any happier and it introduced a level of stress in my life that was was not pressure and was unwelcome right I bought the super expensive watch to wear it around to be then too scared to wear it in public because it it's too expensive and it's too valuable and I might scratch it so now it sits in a box in the safe yeah right so it is useful to chase things to to then prove or disprove whether those things give you any validation or meaning or or what they mean because some of them do there are certain things that you can give and get that that that enrich your life in ways that you didn't didn't appreciate I I live in a pretty oversized large Villa in in B right and I always said I don't need something that big and that fancy it's excessive it's too much we've got space in this office I'm in the corner of and I there's just the this massive room in front of me because I've got all the space right and then when I started inviting people over and I bought clients over and we sat down and I and I and I built an environment where I saw people have

appreciate I I live in a pretty oversized large Villa in in B right and I always said I don't need something that big and that fancy it's excessive it's too much we've got space in this office I'm in the corner of and I there's just the this massive room in front of me because I've got all the space right and then when I started inviting people over and I bought clients over and we sat down and I and I and I built an environment where I saw people have breakthroughs that they'd never had had in any other ways and then I'm expanding my family now a puppies puppies included it to to to enrich this space but for a long time I said I didn't need it I didn't want it and all kinds of levels of cope depending on what attitude I had on the particular day so getting things is useful to prove or disprove whether those things enrich your life because you may be surprised when you hit certain goals or get certain things in your life what they lead to and what they mean to got it it reminds me of another one of your posts where you maybe you can provide some more context on this but you were talking about how hilar how hilarious it is to see these 20s something in monk mode just head down doing nothing not spending any of their money and you're it's going to manifest itself as this crazy midlife crisis at 50 you might as well buy the lambo now dude figure out you don't want it either way it's going to be fun to watch but their C and hooker era is going to be epic because it's it's just bottling up energy and saying that you can Channel it in one way and that will get you to the goal what and there's enough truth in that for certain number of people for it not to be disproven but for many people these these ideas are inherently bottling up energy that could be used in in much more productive ways yeah so would you say the wanting of the material item there's some people who would say don't let that drive you you have to find your why etc etc but you and I both know that why can be more elusive than we want it to be sometimes yeah what would you those are temporary goal posts that you're okay with being I'm doing this right now to get the next material thing and then that will teach me a little bit more about what I don't want and what I do want yeah do stuff get rich and then see how you feel right yeah and this is the same philosophy with with any any growth I knocked on hundreds of doors every day when I was doing door-to-door selling right because behind each door was a the opportunity for the sale right yeah and life is exactly the same life is exactly the same do things work out what those things mean to you and then either do more of them or stop doing them right and that's an oversimplification of a a very simple philosophy but I just believe life is simple do stuff see how it makes you feel what results did you get and then stop it or do more of it and I think especially in societies where there's a lot of high IQ people or and a lot of people professing emotional intelligence a lot of people just get stuck in their head about what success might look and then they abstract that by looking at how someone else does it or I don't want to Lambo because I saw a guy who's got a Lambo and he's an right I don't want to move to B because I saw someone go there and they they got a sore tummy right so they we approximate someone else's experience with ours so it stops people doing stuff and this is the this is the amazing Paradox I see nowadays it's never been easier to start something and it's never been easier to to get rich by just from your ideas yet less and less people are starting because they're worried about what the future might look if they do those things because they're living through other people because

move to B because I saw someone go there and they they got a sore tummy right so they we approximate someone else's experience with ours so it stops people doing stuff and this is the this is the amazing Paradox I see nowadays it's never been easier to start something and it's never been easier to to get rich by just from your ideas yet less and less people are starting because they're worried about what the future might look if they do those things because they're living through other people because they've got that shoved in their face through social media every single day and they go well if I do that then this is going to happen it's you don't know just do stuff yeah do more stuff make more offers take more risks do more things while you can and then learn we only learn by doing yeah such a good point so you listed that you wanted today Who do you need to be, to be successful? to talk about who do you need to be successful who sorry who do you need to be to be successful online I glad I reread it because I was thinking it's what do you need to do to be successful online but that differentiation of who do you need to be is is huge and I want to give you plenty of time to talk about it but I want to ask this question first what would you say in terms of Financial Security what were the levels for you where different levels of abundance or just being able to breathe and look around and focus on this becoming mind frame when did that unlock for you obviously it would be amazing if everyone could unlock that earlier and I think they'd ironically progress faster if they could do it out of abundance instead of out of need but yeah talk about your own Journey there and then let's dive into the the journeys of what other people might look yeah I think each step of the journey if I reflect back whether it was from job to entrepreneurship back to job back to entrepreneurship was finding replacement value as I call it so I work with a lot of people who are have the Golden Hand s they're coming out of a particular place where they're making good money but they feel trapped in it so we work on replacing that level of income with an income that they love doing and a much higher effective value rate because they have multiples of Leverage so rather than earning 150 Grand a year as a as a as a VP you're earning 150 Grand a year as a consultant and you're working 85% less right so for me it was the the the levels of abundance were matching the income of the previous thing of the previous step but getting more time back and that allowed me to be them more creative to take the next step and a lot of people chase the income increase rather than chase the time increase and the times where all the magic happens the times where all the creativity the unique uness the development the building happens but people are focused on the work because they directly correlate the work with getting the income right yeah so for for me I was coming from what was I on when I left grb one about 160 Grand basic plus bits and pieces so say it was 200k by the end of the year right I had to walk in to Consulting gigs that paid me at least that but I could get those Consulting gigs and I could do them in a day and a half a week so I went from a 60h hour a week marketing director with all the responsibility in the world because it was a 247 operation daily deals was that it is that into a into a place where I could do that and then I could have the time to build it and so in the in the each step up as long as the lifestyle didn't expand and it did to to fill the void of of of surplus in the income then I was always just looking for how can I get more time back how can I get more time back but yeah for the vast majority of people they are comfortable right where they are now at that 10,000 is a month

is that into a into a place where I could do that and then I could have the time to build it and so in the in the each step up as long as the lifestyle didn't expand and it did to to fill the void of of of surplus in the income then I was always just looking for how can I get more time back how can I get more time back but yeah for the vast majority of people they are comfortable right where they are now at that 10,000 is a month is the is the comfort is the comfort level and then the desire kicks in because then there's then it's all about the individual being perpetually dissatisfied and the I'll I'll tell you where I sit now I'm on a run rate of 3 million just over 3 million a year right I haven't had a full year where I've done three million but I'm ahead of that run rate and by the end of the financial year I would have yielded over 3 million out of this this current business at 90 plus% profit margins yeah my reach to 10 million is not through need I have Financial abundance I have vehicles where I investing that money and where it's going and I know the purpose of it it's to play the game more and to stretch the scoreboard so as I said here now I don't need more than that but I desire it because I want to work out how to do it under the constraints that I've got and I can clearly see the path to about five and a half million with the current product Suite what I do now with very little alteration and just optimization I can't see the path but candid I can't see the path beyond that the the the technology the The Leverage and those things will come to me and I have no I have no timeline and I have no goal on that so for me it's always been about replacement putting the time and getting the time back and then then understanding where that time goes to to to then take the stretch and go yeah what's next where where do I really want to go and honestly especially there was a four-month period this year we're seven months into the year there's a four-month period this year where the season was Cruise right just Cruise growth pushing scaling it was not just wasn't feeling it and that's a privilege to be at when you've got hundreds of thousands of dollars coming in every month but it's also paying attention to what season you're in yeah oh just Feeling left behind the it goes back to the worldview of I'm just here finding and multiplying ideas and when I wake up one day and I'm not feeling the growth or whatever I just because your model is very much dependent on you because you have very little team members the business has to grow with you comma and that's okay it has to grow when you're feeling good and it has to cruise when you're feeling cruising is there ever still that sense of I'm I'm getting behind does that creep in or do you have you learned to stve that off oh yeah okay and the more you fill your world with super smart clients and super smart friends the more you'll you'll you'll feel I'm missing something here I feel behind the curve on YouTube I feel behind the curve on AI I feel behind the curve and then I just tap up smart people and go what am I missing here what can I see what what can that I can't see and what do you what do you think I should be doing and just be I don't know what I'm talking about so I've got an idea and I know how these principles apply and I I work from principles but how does how does that layer over so yeah I always feel behind and I always feel feel a certain level of dissatisfied but then I check in with myself on the daily on a on a daily basis about what I'm doing who I'm doing it with and and why I'm doing it to ensure that I'm in the driver's seat of my life

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 13

I would quickly convert those five people, and I would quickly validate whether that is good or bad for me, and good or bad for them. But it's only through the doing that those things are validated in terms of where people see value, what they'll buy into, and ultimately, what behavior that they lead to next. ## Concurrent Campaigns: Maximizing Market Economics and Utility **Summary:** James explains how bundling and unbundling allows for running concurrent campaigns, targeting both external and internal markets with different offers. He prioritizes internal offers for existing community members, providing them with preferential pricing and access to exclusive opportunities. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Bundling and unbundling allows us to have multiple offers at once. I can have two concurrent campaigns running at once, so I can be on the outside selling one thing and on the inside selling another thing. You notice over the past few weeks I've opened up various opportunities. I opened up the Circle to people who are in the Syndicate first before I went to the marketplace. I opened up the Blueprint dates to people who are in the Syndicate first before I went to the marketplace. I will, at the moment, exclusively sell one-on-one hours to people who are in the community, rather than selling them to people on my list because there's a higher value proposition and a higher rate of return. I can also discount those things safely in a closed environment. I don't want to go above the line and discount my hours to people who don't know me and don't have a perceived value of that, because all they see is the discount. ## Maintaining Price Integrity and Maximizing Internal Demand **Summary:** James discusses the strategy of offering discounted pricing to existing community members while maintaining a higher market rate for external clients. This approach allows for maximizing internal demand and prevents sending signals to the market that could devalue his premium offerings. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** While my outside market rate is still $5,000, I reduce that significantly for people who are already in that world. This allows me to bundle and unbundle, but also safely price something. I'm not sending a signal to the market. If you are discounting things on a regular basis, then you can be sending signals to the market where ultimately that becomes your fixed daily rate, and I still have people paying $5,000. So I want to make sure that I can maintain the integrity of that. A cycle that I'm going through now is the Syndicate, opening up the Circle, the Blueprint, and then selling the workshops internally. Then I'm going through a different promotion cycle where I've opened up one-on-one hours, opened up the Blueprint for the dates, and ensured that people who are already in the Syndicate or in the community can have a pay plan on the Blueprint. I've got three VIPs booked, and I'll offer those internally first. By taking these goggles, I can have two different things for sale at once, which maximizes the market and economics, but also maximizes the utility. People have been reaching out to me saying, "When are you going to open hours?" So there was already demand there internally that I could tap. ## Minimizing Complexity for Scalability and Growth **Summary:** James emphasizes the importance of minimizing complexity in business for scalability and growth. He explains that too much variation in delivery creates complexity, making it difficult to scale and hindering the development of a solid value proposition. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** We're looking at reducing complexity. All of the things that I am showing you are things that I'm doing and things that I can scale. I'm prepared to do a segment of hours every few months

. He explains that too much variation in delivery creates complexity, making it difficult to scale and hindering the development of a solid value proposition. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** We're looking at reducing complexity. All of the things that I am showing you are things that I'm doing and things that I can scale. I'm prepared to do a segment of hours every few months. Is it maximally scalable? No, it's not, because I limit the number of one-on-one hours that I have available. The minimizing complexity piece is the piece where most people fall over with this because they start creating rather than unbundling. The more variation we have in delivery, the more complexity we have. If you are doing a lot of different things for different clients at different price points, then you have high complexity. It doesn't matter what your business model is, if you have a lot of variability in delivery, you have a complex business, and complex businesses are hard to scale. They're hard to grow because it's more mental because you don't know what you're offering at any price point. You don't have a solid value proposition. So the more variables you have in your client base, the more complex the business is. If you are doing a small number of things routinely, then you'll have lower complexity. ## Scalability and the Standalone Product Test **Summary:** James explains that the test of a scalable product is whether it can stand on its own and generate significant revenue independently. He uses his own products (one-on-one hours, Blueprint, Circle) as examples of scalable offerings that can each generate six-figure or multiple six-figure incomes. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** The test is in each individual product. If it can stand on its own and scale. For me, the test is, are these individual products a business on their own right? Could I make six or multiple six figures a year out of selling one-on-one hours? Yes. Could I make six or multiple six figures out of selling the Blueprint, by doing the VIP, by just doing the Circle? The answer is yes. So therefore, those things all scale. They scale on the practical level is that I can do them repeatedly, and they scale on the emotional level, as I'm prepared to do them repeatedly. While I'll go through seasons where I'm definitely keen to do one-on-one hours more than I am at other times, they will always be a presence in the business. So by plotting the map of what we have, we have a lot of flexibility. The products are much more dynamic. And then it's up to us: what can we experiment with? What can we go to market with where people will see a value equation that they haven't seen before? ## The Value of a Product Map and Addressing Weaknesses **Summary:** James emphasizes the importance of having a product map to understand the lay of the land in terms of assets and identify weaknesses in production and scalability. He advises pricing products that don't scale accordingly to avoid over-delivering on offerings that demand significant time and energy. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Plenty of people won't see a value equation in the Syndicate. Plenty of people won't see a full value equation in the Circle. I've had conversations with a couple of you, and we decided that the Syndicate was the best place for you right now because you were getting the right level of access to community, the right level of access to me and help. So going up and making the commitment to tripling your investment on a weekly basis doesn't make sense, but that doesn't preclude you from periodically buying hours and access

. Plenty of people won't see a full value equation in the Circle. I've had conversations with a couple of you, and we decided that the Syndicate was the best place for you right now because you were getting the right level of access to community, the right level of access to me and help. So going up and making the commitment to tripling your investment on a weekly basis doesn't make sense, but that doesn't preclude you from periodically buying hours and access. Having a map and having a view of what a product, what an asset is, and ultimately what an offer is, allows us to look at the lay of the land in terms of our assets and the things that we produce, but it also highlights our weaknesses. Are we producing enough in terms of creating assets? It also highlights the weaknesses: are there things that we are doing that we don't want to scale and tolerate? Because if those things are present, then we won't scale them. A number of people, especially in the health and personal development categories, were looking to remove some of the custom elements of their programs because they understood that those things didn't scale. So productizing those pieces, while they're attractive to the market, also, they only have limited scale, so they must be priced accordingly. ## Content-Only Offers and Market Experimentation **Summary:** James discusses the potential of content-only offers as a way to experiment with the market and understand buyer behavior. He considers offering access to all his trainings on a recurring basis without any additional components to see how this impacts buyer cohorts and potential upsells. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** The map is really important to understand those things and then experiment. I will go to the market over the coming months with a content-only offer where it's just,

> "Yeah, have access to all my trainings on a recurring basis,"
 and with nothing else there. What will that do? I don't know. Will it create a whole cohort of buyers? Yes, it will. What will those buyers do? We will see. What behaviors do they undertake? Do people buy my trainings, and then do a portion of those people then buy one-on-one hours over the top, so they skip out the group components? Possibly. Maybe that's happening at the moment where people are bundling together on their own by buying access to some of my content, but also buying one-on-one hours with me, and skipping over the group component that we have in the Syndicate. For them, that value equation is the most efficient at the relative price point. ## Unbundling for Client Empowerment and Flexibility **Summary:** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages. He emphasizes the importance of offering scalable products and being open to how clients choose to combine them, recognizing that different combinations will appeal to different individuals. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Unbundling allows our audience and our clients and our customers to access the value that they see fit, and as long as we are prepared to do it and prepared to offer it because it's scalable to us, then they can assemble that for us with low complexity. I don't have a preference for what 90% of people buy off me until I do have a preference in terms of, I can help advise them what's the best path to go in. So that means that by unbundling, I allow people to choose their own adventure and assemble things that I can't see. A training plus a one-on-one component would be highly valuable to one person, but highly risky for someone else because they wouldn't be able to extract the value fast enough relative to where they are. So it comes back to us being able to unbundle, and our clients being able to see the value equation and tip it in their favor. ## Addressing Client Objections and Diagnosing Value Equations **Summary:** James discusses how to handle client objections related to price by diagnosing their individual value equations. He emphasizes asking clients what they're trying to achieve rather than directly addressing their price concerns, as this provides valuable context for understanding their needs. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** As with any sales conversation, you're diagnosing their own value equation. So what do they say? What do they perceive value in? I've purposely avoided upselling and downselling because it's part of a sales process, whereas this is part of a productization process. What you're looking for is them to put the truth on the table as to where they perceive value. And then you've got the option to present how you would deliver against that value. I'll give you two real examples. When I launched the Circle, I said to two people, "You don't need it." One person said, 
> "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it."

> "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it."
 And so I made an offer where they'd have access to the community and the trainings, and one-on-one access to me via WhatsApp at a price that's higher than the Circle, which includes that component. And they perceived more value in that because they don't want to be involved in group stuff. They want training, and they want to be able to message me. At a practical level, I don't seek to apply a solution. I don't say, "What do value in?" etc. I ask them what they're trying to do. Because that doesn't mean anything without context. "Too expensive" for what? You don't know what that means until you ask them and understand what the context means. We should be rigid in our boundaries and flexible in our packaging of those boundaries. ## Ashley's Unbundling Ideas: Nutrition-Only Offer and Executive Consulting **Summary:** Ashley Richmond proposes two unbundling ideas: a nutrition-only offer for clients already working with trainers and a higher-priced consulting offer for executives who prefer individualized guidance. James cautions against adding complexity and encourages leveraging existing components. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** I think with my offer, offering something just nutrition would probably go well, cause a lot of people are working with an in-person trainer, so they don't need fitness, but they do need nutrition. I also think there's room for the people who want less stuff and are willing to pay more. A lot of executives don't want the group aspect at all. They just want me to tell them what to do. So I think there's room for some consulting offer where they get messaging, a roadmap for them. With nutrition, it's a lot of ongoing support. I think that ongoing support would be helpful in a group. So I'd probably start with an audit, make a plan going forward, and maybe weekly check-ins without trying to make it too complicated. Having a chat, whether it was a group or a one-on-one chat, would be helpful. I already have a WhatsApp group, so I could just make an extra channel for them. If you're adding a component, then you're potentially adding complexity. Anything that's even a small amount of complexity in a leverage business can add up to a large amount of complexity, because leverage works always. Leverage works for us, but it also works against us. ## Unbundling by Frame: Removing the Fitness Component **Summary:** Ashley and James discuss unbundling her existing program by removing the fitness component for clients who already have trainers. James points out that this is unbundling by frame, as the underlying components remain the same, and suggests a pricing strategy based on this reframing. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** At your $100 level, they get training and group messaging. I'd be taking out the fitness side, and then probably the rest would stay the same. So they get the modules, which would have fitness stuff in there anyway, and then the group channel as well ============================================================ # SOURCE FILE: all_transcripts_combined_part_8.txt

- ```txt ## Leveraging Group Dynamics for Client Acquisition **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the benefits of incorporating a group element into coaching programs, even in the initial stages. This fosters a sense of community and makes it easier to expand the program by attracting new clients to an established, thriving group. Video Source:* source: Cash.txt **Content:** Having a group element, even if it's just the first iteration, is hugely beneficial. It becomes a thing, and if it's a thing you love, and it's lucrative, then we're much more likely to sell into a thing once we've got it rolling. Because if I've got 4 people doing this, then why not 5? So you're more likely to grow it and make an offer around it. ## Discernment and Setting Limits in Client Work **Summary:** James Kemp advises coaches to exercise discernment and set limits on their time and availability. While one-on-one coaching is valuable, it can lead to burnout if not managed carefully with boundaries and realistic client capacity. Video Source:* source: Cash.txt **Content:** The thing I'll leave you with is discernment. One-on-one and these components are selling time. They are highly valuable and they have a high return. But things that have a high return also have a high cost. The things that have burnt me out the fastest? Lots of time at Zoom, lots of one-on-one, lots of events, lots of availability, and little boundaries. So it does require discernment to deploy these things and place limits on them. We talk limits a lot about just the practical elements of scarcity and deadlines, both to stimulate the market and get a decision, but also to mitigate delivery issues. It's great to sign 15 clients at once, but if you can't onboard all 15 clients in a reasonable amount of time, you're not going to have 15 clients for very long. So use discernment. Go under the limits that you think you can have capacity for. You think you can take 5 one-on-one clients? You think you can do 10 a week? My recommendation is, halve it, because that's the reality of what you can deploy adequately. Sure, if times are tough and you need some cash flow, then maybe you do need to sell every hour that God gave you to get back on track. There is a time and a place for those things, for doing things we've all done things that maybe didn't necessarily want to do to stay in the game. ## The Power of Simplicity and Sustainable Growth **Summary:** James Kemp highlights the importance of simple, yet powerful strategies for client acquisition and retention. He stresses sustainable growth within one's capacity, avoiding overextension that could hinder future progress. Video Source:* source: Cash.txt **Content:** Use discernment when you're deploying these things, then their power is in their simplicity. But their power is also that they're putting you in a place to move forward rather than maybe limit the next step that you can make as well. ## Event Follow up and Content Distribution **Summary:** James Kemp addresses inquiries about an event, prioritizing existing syndicate members. He also discusses plans for distributing the recording, promising to edit out unnecessary parts before sharing it with the syndicate. Video Source:* source: Cash.txt **Content:** A couple of people messaged me about the event privately. I give syndicate folks first dibs on those. I only put the date up yesterday, so I'll release those probably in a week or so, more publicly, after I've got some more folks in the syndicate. Thank you very much. We'll get the recording out later. We'll edit the bullshit at the beginning and the rambling at the end, and we'll get it out to you

.txt **Content:** A couple of people messaged me about the event privately. I give syndicate folks first dibs on those. I only put the date up yesterday, so I'll release those probably in a week or so, more publicly, after I've got some more folks in the syndicate. Thank you very much. We'll get the recording out later. We'll edit the bullshit at the beginning and the rambling at the end, and we'll get it out to you. Our syndicate people will be in the piece, and I guess I'll be in the, we'll host it on the page, but we'll drop you an email when it's ready. ## Content Creation for Meaningful Conversations **Summary:** James Kemp introduces his approach to content creation, emphasizing its role in sparking conversations that lead to sales. He defines content broadly as any creation designed to communicate a message, prioritizing communication skills over platform-specific strategies. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** So welcome, squad, welcome to our guests as well. If this is your first time, welcome. We've got a Google Doc, it will be, I just had 10 other people join since then, so it will be in the shared with the replay both inside the classroom and also, I guess you'll get a copy of the replay and resources. So, content. To set the scene, I'm going to talk about content in general terms. I get specific in terms of platforms and these different, even mediums. But when I talk about content, I'm talking about the creation of something to convey, to communicate and convey a message. So when I talk about content, you'll understand that philosophy as I go along. I'm not starting from the point of, this is content for Facebook, this is content for email, this is content for YouTube, or whatever. The origin point of content is communication, and knowing how to communicate and what to communicate is the 80/20 factor. So when I talk about content, I talk about it in the macro, and obviously the examples I show you through this are in the micro. They live out in the world, whether it's email or Facebook or Instagram or other places. Content makes money, and content is the most democratized form of leverage that there is. You do not need money to create content. For many other forms of leverage in the world, you need existing resources to have any advantage in deploying leverage. Content is not that. It is fully democratized. The flip side of that is, it's fully competitive. The demands on our attention have never been greater, because there's never been more content. And to be clear, I create content to create conversations. I make money from conversations. I don't make money from making an offer. I make money from understanding what somebody wants and having a solution to that, and then delivering on that solution. But I've made friends, connected with people, made millions of dollars from content. But unless I see something back from it, unless I see over the long term, I wouldn't be participating in making content. And just to, in terms of, to understand that, I write for myself more than I write for other people to communicate. So I have millions more words in different places that are writing to me, which is my thinking that I don't communicate with other people. I just communicate with other people to generate conversations so I can be useful to them. ## The Importance of Practice and Distilling Success Factors **Summary:** James Kemp acknowledges the difficulty of teaching content creation due to his own unconscious competence. He emphasizes the importance of practice and aims to distill his success factors into actionable steps for his audience. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** I will admit something: this is very difficult for me to teach because I've been doing it for so long

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 15

. So inside our world, we do and build those things. Inside our workshops, we give more context to those things. How do you create a hybrid offer? So we show, we have a look behind the curtain. In the content that I create, I will be speaking about the mechanisms over and over again. I will be talking about the hybrid offer over and over again, and inserting it into one of my content types. I'll be talking about customers to clients, creating customers, turning them into clients, multiple times, because it's a mechanism that is effective and we use it. And I'll be talking about the daily client machine multiple times. So by just inserting those mechanisms into my content, I'm creating context within the content that I create. So if I go to Facebook right now, and I search the word "hybrid," and I look for posts from me, and I search the word "hybrid," you will see how consistently I have created context around that word, the hybrid offer. I've created it so much that everyone in the world has stolen the idea from me. I partly jest, but the nature of inserting the mechanism over and over again means that I'm generating context about that mechanism all the time. My consistency is not only in the creation of the content, but it's also on the insertion of the mechanism. ## Mechanisms, Identity, and Market Differentiation **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of unique mechanisms and a clear identity as key differentiators in a commoditized market. He explains that mechanisms are the unique ways problems are solved and should be consistently highlighted in content. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** And, I've been shouting from the rooftops recently about competition and comparison, and what's left for people to compete on. The only thing left for you to compete on is your unique mechanisms and the ideas that you bring to the market. Everything else is commoditized. Every single other thing can be copied and replicated. But your mechanisms and your orientation towards those mechanisms, the mechanism being the way that you get results, is the thing that you can consistently do that. So we can do this after, in the workshop portion. But if we create context around our mechanisms and we insert those repeatedly, and then we have an aspirational identity – you don't even need to be that good at content and that good at communication, you just need to be consistent with the messaging – mechanisms come down to the unique way you solve problems and a clarity over who those problems are solved for, or the desires they have. ## Content Creation Superstructure and Resources **Summary:** James Kemp reiterates the importance of context in content and directs his audience to additional resources on mechanisms, identity, and authority within his membership and syndicate programs. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** So after we've thought about what context we want to deliver, what mechanisms we have that we want to insert into the content, by the way, if you're in the membership of the syndicate, more on mechanisms and identity and creation and authority in the classroom. So I've linked directly to that. So once we've inserted the context piece, we need to have the actual content., what do we say and what do we write about? ## The Power Laws of Content and Four Content Buckets **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the power laws of content, stating that a small percentage of content drives the majority of results. He then outlines four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problem, and plan – as tools for effective content creation. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** The power laws in content are the power laws in anything else. 95% of the results from social and from content are driven by less than 5% of your content

. He then outlines four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problem, and plan – as tools for effective content creation. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** The power laws in content are the power laws in anything else. 95% of the results from social and from content are driven by less than 5% of your content. I could point at a few dozen posts that have done more for brand and sales and audience and trust and those things than 250 other things that I've posted. So there are four simple buckets of content that can be created regularly: philosophy, proof, problem, and plan. And I want to give you these tools so you can take the tools, assemble them, and then break them apart and reassemble them because it's too simplistic to say that there's this, there's one equation that you just write about philosophy, you just write about problem, you just write a plan. The reality is that in the content, all these ideas are blended together. ## Philosophy Content: Sharing Personal Beliefs **Summary:** James Kemp defines philosophy content as sharing personal beliefs and worldview. He emphasizes the importance of authenticity and vulnerability in this type of content, suggesting it builds trust in a low-trust market. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** So I've got to give you examples, otherwise this is much less useful. So philosophy is what you personally believe to be true. And in the marketplace, in a low-trust marketplace, people are buying who someone is and what they believe in greater numbers than they're buying what they do, because what they do is largely commoditized. So what do you personally believe to be true? What do you believe? What do you observe? What trends are you seeing? What taste do you have? And how do you think differently about common ideas? What are the things hiding in plain sight? And what do that is hidden to others? And often your philosophy, in terms of the vulnerability part, has a useful requirement to say things that other people won't say. in this piece of content, I'm saying that if you don't do the thing that you tell other people to do, then you have a lack of congruency with what you want people to do. If you're a coach and you don't invest in coaching, there's a small lack of congruency there. If you're a fat personal trainer, you get less clients. All of these ideas are, people are observing., my philosophy is, I do what I teach and teach what I do. I've done the things that I talk about, and I do the things that I tell other people to do, and then I demonstrate them along the way. So the philosophy is, do what you say you're going to do and be who you say you are, and demonstrate that along the way. It's much more powerful than telling people the opposite thing. But in that case, I'm calling out an idea, being maybe mildly offensive to some people, but demonstrating in real time what I believe. And again, vulnerability is required. When I talk about my personal life and those things, they're through the lens of an insight and a story. And sometimes vulnerably, they're through the lens of me being me, seeing something that frustrates me and triggers me because it's something that I tolerated or compromised on in the past. So sometimes I get annoyed because I see a past version of myself and realize that it doesn't have to be that. So I will create content that attempts to tell that story. So philosophy is you. What do you believe, and what is your worldview? To a lesser or greater extent, all of my clients share some or all of my worldview about my ideas about sovereignty and freedom and these pieces. So I share those on a regular basis because being my people is an important part of being in my world

. So I will create content that attempts to tell that story. So philosophy is you. What do you believe, and what is your worldview? To a lesser or greater extent, all of my clients share some or all of my worldview about my ideas about sovereignty and freedom and these pieces. So I share those on a regular basis because being my people is an important part of being in my world. It's very useful to believe those things. If people want to build a gigantic business with a glass building with a name on it, then I'm probably not the right guy to talk to. And so I need to be clear in my content that this is what I believe, and this is what I stand for, and this is also what I don't believe in as well. ## Proof Content: Demonstrating How Results are Achieved **Summary:** James Kemp defines proof content as going beyond testimonials by providing insights into how clients achieved results. He stresses the importance of highlighting the mechanisms used to achieve success, making the process replicable for potential clients. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** The second type is proof, and proof is different to, say, a case study or a testimonial. It's different to a testimonial, but it's definitely my take on a case study. Proof is proving you can help someone by demonstrating how you help someone. And solid proof goes beyond testimonials. It delivers insight on how someone you worked with got a result, and mechanisms are very, very useful when you're talking about proof. So this post here, talking about how Tom made 19k in sales helping people finish their music. He joined the syndicate, so I'm inserting the product name, the thing he participated in. And then I'm talking about the mechanisms that are used to generate that 19k. Again, an example many years ago from Matt, the eight steps that he took to transform his business with a case study. I'm not saying just what the results were. I am telling people the mechanisms these people used to get the results. And that's the distinction between a typical case study. Most case studies aim to boost the credibility of the person narrating the story. I'm seeking to generate an insight to show that there's things that are accessible for people to get a result, that if you use a hybrid offer, if you use customers to clients, if you use the daily client machine, etc., that you can get a result behind them. So there's that. I dig deeper into more of those examples, and the actual breakdown of those and the ultimate case study template, which is again in the classroom. But, at a very simple level, these are one step beyond a case study. They're not saying just what happened, they're demonstrating how it happened as well. ## Problem Content: Sharing Insights and Solutions **Summary:** James Kemp defines problem content as sharing insights gathered from experience, offering solutions to common problems. He advocates for providing complete solutions within the content, demonstrating expertise and building trust. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** Problem. So this is, share an insight that you gather from delivering. The more common the problem, and the more unique your approach to solving it, the more traction these posts get. This is where a belief in giving everybody everything they need in your content is useful. I don't hold back when I tell stories that I create. I don't say,

- ```txt ## Pricing for Mentorship **Summary:** James Kemp discusses his pricing strategy for his mentorship program, the Syndicate, explaining how he arrived at the sweet spot of $300 per week and how this pricing allows for flexibility and optimal results for his clients. Video Source:* Million Dollar Mentor.txt **Content:** The pricing sensitivity of the Syndicate was pretty high. When I started, it was $250 a week, and I slowly raised it over 19 months to $500. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, including considering who I enjoyed working with and their energy levels, I found the sweet spot is about $300 a week. People paying around that price stay the longest and get the best results. They also utilize the flexibility of the model, moving up to the Circle for more intensive coaching when needed, and then returning to the Syndicate when less access is sufficient. Going forward, I'm leading with a mentorship offer. Coaching will be limited to 24 people by invitation only. Most people I coach will come through the mentorship offer, understand the distinction, and then decide if they want more access. ## The Power of Demonstrating in Mentorship **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the shift from coaching to mentorship, highlighting the benefits of demonstrating and showing clients how to achieve results, rather than solely coaching them. Video Source:* Million Dollar Mentor.txt **Content:** This is the frame of the offer: our goal is building a 100k per month sovereign consulting business, 65 clients or less, and working under 3 days a week. I will *show* you exactly how I've done it, give you my tools, and help you implement them. The promise isn't "I will coach you," but "I will show you." Mentorship requires access, so we have calls, but we're clear about what happens. In the Syndicate, you have office hours with me Tuesdays and Thursdays, plus monthly workshops where I show you what's working for me and help you implement it. I've removed the promise of bi-monthly workshops. Now I'll do them when it feels right and when the insights are flowing. This is a mentorship community. I show you what's working in real time and help you implement it. This is *not* coaching where I provide accountability, tracking, and motivation. It's on you to bring those, though there are options to get that from me to accelerate your results. ## Positioning Mentorship Against Coaching **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the market opportunity for mentorship, explaining how to position it as a superior alternative to coaching for a specific target audience. Video Source:* Million Dollar Mentor.txt **Content:** The market opportunity for positioning mentorship as better than coaching is significant. Many people have had poor experiences with online coaching—being handed off to assistants, lacking access, or experiencing a mismatch between promises and implementation. Positioning mentorship against coaching is an easy sell. Mentorship doesn't require the same level of investment as coaching, and it's often cheaper. Distinctions create contrast, and contrast draws attention. My messaging is targeted at those currently doing something called coaching or who are dissatisfied with their current model and time commitments. I also target those who have achieved significant things but are repulsed by the online coaching world. Both groups are looking for a new and better opportunity. ## Recurring Revenue as a Hindsight Metric **Summary:** James Kemp explains that recurring revenue is a metric observed in hindsight, emphasizing the importance of focusing on client momentum and dynamic offers to create a model that generates recurring revenue over time. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** Recurring revenue is a mirage. It only recurs in hindsight. Many in the coaching and consulting space believe they have recurring revenue businesses, but they have long-duration products on payment plans. This is a crucial distinction. The only real money is *now* money – cash in the bank

. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** Recurring revenue is a mirage. It only recurs in hindsight. Many in the coaching and consulting space believe they have recurring revenue businesses, but they have long-duration products on payment plans. This is a crucial distinction. The only real money is *now* money – cash in the bank. Upfront payments create a delivery liability. The 20k you accept for 12 months of work is a delivery obligation. Smart businesses balance assets and liabilities. Clients are assets, and we generate yield by delivering agreed value. To grow revenue, we grow the asset: increase clients, client value, or client lifetime. My definition of recurring revenue is revenue that showed up in the past. I'll show you revenue that has recurred. I'll take you into the future so you can build a model that generates recurring revenue when you look back. ## The Power of Weekly Pricing **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for weekly pricing over monthly, highlighting its benefits in terms of increased sales, higher annual revenue, client flexibility, and reduced churn. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** I've found weekly pricing superior to monthly. Objectively, it has a lower "now" number, increasing sales. It generates 8.5% more annually due to 13 four-week blocks in a year. Subjectively, it's more dynamic. Clients feel more flexibility with adding/removing products and payments. It's simpler to upsell, downsell, and minimize churn as investment decisions are more immediate. I cut churn by 80% when I implemented a community level at a lower price, as people downgraded rather than left completely. ## The Simple-Complex Stack for Recurring Revenue **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the simple-complex stack, a strategy for creating a series of offers that address the increasing complexity clients experience as they implement simple initial promises, ensuring continued client engagement and recurring revenue. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** If we make things simple for clients, our offer is simple to sell. But even simple processes are individually complex. I make it simple to create a $3,000 offer. The complexity comes in the execution. Some people sell immediately, others take months. We take people through a simple-complex axis. Simple: "I'll create a $3,000 offer with you." Complex: "How do I sell it?" Simple: "I'll create it for you (Fastlane)." Complex: "It's hard to make $3k/week consistently." Simple:

> "Join the Syndicate, I'll tell you exactly what to do."
 This chain is theoretically infinite. Over time, this axis can continually be sold to an individual client. Making your offer simple, while appreciating the client's experience of complexity, allows for a natural next offer. ## The Social Code: Delivering Insight **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of delivering insight on social media, differentiating it from readily available information and highlighting its value in attracting and engaging an audience. Video Source:* Social Code.txt **Content:** You must deliver insight because insight is extremely rare, and rare things are valuable. Information allows us to observe what is happening, but insights tell us *why*. If you can demonstrate why something is happening in someone's life, you demonstrate a deeper understanding that others seek. People are seeking a deeper understanding of why things happen to them. Insight starts to piece together why something’s happening through real experience. ## The Social Code: Selling Ideas **Summary:** James Kemp explains that social media is best used for selling ideas, not products, as this builds buy-in and makes selling products easier later on. Video Source:* Social Code.txt **Content:** Before someone can buy something, they need to buy *into* something – an idea. If you sell people on your ideas on social, it’s much easier to sell them on you and your products. The sequence is always idea first, then product. Approach social media as an idea salesperson. Don't make direct offers. It’s clunky and induces fatigue. Use social content to move people to social messaging or email. ## The Social Code: Plan Posts for Leadership **Summary:** James Kemp explains that plan posts, which outline a clear direction and strategy, are the most powerful type of social media content for establishing leadership and attracting a following. Video Source:* Social Code.txt **Content:** In a chaotic world, everyone wants a plan. To get followers, you need to lead. To establish leadership, decide on a direction, define it, and lead others towards it. This content blends philosophy, proof, and problem. Plans require courage. They work well as pillar content because they’re risky. Setting your stall out is the single biggest movement of attention you can make. This content can be repurposed and referred back to. On July 18th, I posted my plan to get back to $3 million a year. I detailed the steps, and people were curious and started following along. Eight weeks later, I updated them on my progress. These posts create a viral loop. Setting a plan is powerful for attracting a following and for self-accountability. It sets you on a journey. ## The Social Code: Moving from Public to Private **Summary:** James Kemp discusses strategies for moving people from public social media feeds to private messaging or email, where direct offers can be made more effectively. Video Source:* Social Code.txt **Content:** Attraction takes time. Direct asks move people to the next stage. Two-step posts get people to respond, then you send a DM. Examples: 
> "Recorded a loom on selling 60k hybrid offers with a Google Doc. Want the private link?"
 or 
> "Finally doing a workshop on my social media strategy. DM for the link."
 Be explicit – ask for comments, then DM. I've evolved this into "insight two-steps." They ask for a comment, but I treat them sales letters. Example: 
> "Three steps to selling high-ticket with a three-page doc. Since July, 90 people signed up, paying 10k-75k/year. I did it with a Google Doc. Promise: new money, expand LTV. Workshop:

[details]. DM for link."
 This is a sales page with insight. Sell up to the line, but make the sale via DM. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Prioritizing Life Over Business **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the Sovereign Consultant model, emphasizing the importance of building a life that a business feeds, rather than the other way around, and prioritizing intentional inputs and leverage. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The Sovereign Consultant model is about building a life that a business feeds. Most people want a good life, and the cash flow, impact, and meaning a business provides can feed that life. It's easy to stay at the surface level of strategy, but tactics and strategies alone are volatile and exhausting. Principles and philosophy guide strategy and lower volatility. My calendar demonstrates what's important to me: daily exercise, date night, family dinner, client group calls, and calls only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This creates space for creativity and flow. You don't earn the right to free space; you choose it. Intentional time management dictates results. The Sovereign way is about leverage and serving the maximum number of people. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Building a Brand **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a three-step process for building a strong brand: defining and selling a unique mechanism, crafting an aspirational identity, and building a world around your brand. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A brand is what people say about you when you're not there. The ideal brand does all the selling. Three components: world, identity, and mechanisms. Start with the mechanism – the way you get results. It needs to be unique (yours) and work. Examples: Daily Client Machine (lead magnet with a self-liquidating offer), Customers to Clients (low-ticket workshops with an offer), Hybrid Offer (selling via documents). Next, craft an aspirational identity. What does someone become when they commit to your world? JK's "Cash Creators" is a great example. Finally, world-building. People buy who you are more than what you do. World-building is an abstraction of your reality. Components: characters, language, places, storylines, memes. My world: The Brazilian, Mr. 13, Miss 7, the cat, the dog, Bali, my journey back to $3 million. Have fun with it (oat milk, Atomic Habits). ``` ============================================================

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 5

> "If I do this, then this will happen. If I do this, then this person will think…"
 It turns into a catastrophic whirlwind of ideas and pre-protected future outcomes that are all fiction. “If I do this, then this will happen, and if I do this, then I will lose this, and if I lose that, then I will be broke, and if I am broke my wife will stop loving me, and my kids will think I’m a loser, and then I will…” People can do that in a microsecond because they believe they understand the second and third order consequences of their decisions. My favorite story is, "I don't know," because it's the closest one to the truth that I know. If I do something today, what is the outcome? I don't know. My only story is, "I don't know, but I'm willing to find out." This means I surrender to a benevolent universe, and I'm constantly able to move forward because I surrender to the fact that I cannot predict the future, but I can give to it. ## Normalize Discomfort and Embrace Action **Summary:** Normalize discomfort by repeatedly engaging in activities you perceive as challenging. Think in questions rather than definitive statements, and default to speed by acting quickly on your decisions to build self-esteem. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Normalize discomfort. This requires embracing it, just dissatisfaction. The story we tell about discomfort is usually much worse than the discomfort we experience by taking action. Normalizing discomfort is a superpower, enabling operation in spaces where others can't because they're not used to the stress. Normalizing discomfort is purely doing the things you currently see as hard or difficult repeatedly until they become… not easy, but just boring old reps. Similar to not telling stories is thinking in questions. I notice a lot of people think differently to me because they think in statements that are definitive and create the illusion that they know what is going to happen if they take a certain set of actions. I perpetually think in a state of curiosity: 
> "I don't know what will happen if I do this. I believe this could happen. I wonder what will happen?"
 And then I take the action. I have trained myself to think in questions much more than in definitive statements because that helps me stay in the space of, 
> "I don't know, but I can control the inputs. I just can't control the outputs."

> "I don't know what will happen if I do this. I believe this could happen. I wonder what will happen?"
 And then I take the action. I have trained myself to think in questions much more than in definitive statements because that helps me stay in the space of, 
> "I don't know, but I can control the inputs. I just can't control the outputs."
 Default to speed. If you have cultivated removing need, not telling stories, embracing discomfort, and thinking in questions, the only thing left is to act. Action is the only way we move forward. The longer you take between coming to a decision and applying it, the lower your self-esteem becomes because you're sitting in the void of a lie. You have a knowing, a knowledge, and you're not applying the action. The bigger the gap between those things, the lower your belief that the gap will be closed. The slowest people to act always have the lower self-belief. The fastest people to act always have the higher self-belief because they get into the feedback loop much more quickly. They've surrendered to the fact that they don't know, but they acted, and then the action led to the next action, and then they stack those things together. When you have looked at your beliefs, assessed what you need to do, and then act immediately, your self-belief and self-esteem rise because you've closed the gap between what is true for you. If you don't close the gap, then you're operating in the void, which is, "I know these things, but I'm not acting on them," and then your belief in future action will diminish. ## Embracing Your Rightness and Choosing Empowering Beliefs **Summary:** Everyone's beliefs are right for them. The key is to choose beliefs that empower you and align with a supportive universe, leading to a rewarding experience of rightness. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** The biggest challenge with mindset stuff is that you are always right. All the things you believe, by nature, are right. People spend their whole lives arguing about right and wrong, but your beliefs are ultimately right, and then you act in validation of those all the time. Everybody's right. The art is choosing the set of beliefs that you operate under that enable the rightness to be rewarded. Without a belief that the universe has your back, it's pretty difficult to get my point. ## Anxiety, Momentum, and Trusting the Universe **Summary:** Anxiety often arises when we slow down and overthink our current position instead of focusing on our direction. Trusting the universe and maintaining momentum are key antidotes to anxiety. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** I really this, and it… I turned up late today because it was the perfect timing for me, because I feel I've been getting lately really quite anxious every now and then. It's really interesting, looking at everything that you've said here versus when I seem to feel it. I seem to feel this anxiousness around business when I… you've said it to me before, when I slow down too much to the current space, and I… and I start to look too much at… this is good… it's hard to put it into words, but where I am now as opposed to where I'm going. Then I start to overthink everything, and I start to feel lost. Usually the antidote to that is, as you always say, it's getting back into momentum. It's weird, because sometimes… I guess this is the believing that the universe has your back. I guess that in that state of anxiousness, I start to think,

> "Shit, what if just getting back into momentum won't be enough this time? It's been enough these other times, but I'm, 'Fuck, what if it's not going to be now?'"
 And then I start to overthink, and that slows me down from getting back into momentum. It's very strange, but this has been a great reminder, because I'm slightly in that state now of just… everything seems to work when I don't do a lot of the things I used to do, and I just focus on moving forwards and staying in momentum and focusing on where I'm going. ## Overcoming Anxiety and Seeing the Board **Summary:** Overcoming anxiety can initially feel unsettling, but it ultimately unlocks a greater capacity to see the path forward and make the right moves, trusting in the flow of the universe. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Up until three years ago, I lived in a pretty much perpetual state of anxiety, to a low level or to a high level. When I started to unpack some of this stuff and some of these ideas for myself and operate in that state of removing anxiety and really thinking about what it was, rather than a mental thing or a chemical thing, or whatever, some pathology of it… the first experiences of not having anxiety made me anxious because I was anxious that I didn't have anxiety anymore. It perpetuated for a little bit longer because then I was, 
> "But this is a thing that everybody else has and everybody else does, and then I removed it."

And then I started to wonder why I didn't have any of it anymore. But then when I was on that plane, I had this level of capacity and being able to see the board in front of me that I've never had. I knew the next move. In the last few years, a lot of people have asked me, "Who's your mentor? Who are you getting coached by?" Most of those things have been very specific or spasmodic because I am… because I can see the board in front of me. I know the next move, even if I don't know what it is. I know it's there, and I know it comes. The removal of anxiety is that peeling back of… all the moves are there, and they… I can see all the concurrent timelines on how they go, and I just decide and choose, and I operate in that state. The transition from having consistent, constant anxiety… and again, we shouldn't judge any of these things, because there are our own personal semantic definitions of them. Some people have debilitating what they call anxiety, and other people just sit there with a low level of it and are not even aware of it, and it drives them. That judgment of what it is is pointless, but the removal of it allows you to tap into the flow, which says all the moves are right there, and the surrender to them, and there is no wrongness in any of it. There is no worry. There is no central thing that is catastrophic that will go wrong. ## The Body as a Supercomputer and the Importance of Raw Materials **Summary:** Our bodies function optimally when provided with the right inputs, including proper nutrition, sleep, and awareness. This allows our minds to operate at their best and align with our authentic selves. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** This resonates so much, and I would love to add a thought. My opinion is that, yes, to all that you said, and also the understanding that our body is a supercomputer and therefore it operates best when it's given the right raw material. So energy and, yes, active participants to be carrying for our mind and body. I hear you saying, though, and that might just be the story that I'm telling myself, so therefore it's true for me, because I hear you saying, not operate from a need. But what I was going to say is things the right food sources, the right amount of sleep, the right amount of awareness gives our body the raw material it needs to function at its best. So then our brain operates at its best. I love… I want to offer another analogy. Daniel Priestley gives the analogy of the David, and I had never heard that story before, but the way he says it in the 10x Is Greater Than 2x is that the creation of the David was the removal of everything that was not the David. I think when we look at us as humans, I feel sometimes it is this journey of removing everything that is not authentically true to who we are, because, I agree, I think we innately know, when we give ourselves space to be present with it, who we are called to be. We go through a process of remembering and clarifying and seeing who that is and letting go of everything that isn't part of it. ## The Light Touch of Holding Results and Avoiding Tight Grip **Summary:** Holding results too tightly, especially financial ones, can lead to their loss. A light touch and trust in the universe's balancing act are crucial for achieving desired outcomes. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Someone said to someone the other day on a private call about their holding tightness of results, their results being money. Money particularly is sand in your hand. The harder you squeeze it, the more it leaks between the fingers and disappears

[expletive]. ## Avoiding Dogma and Embracing Individuality in Practices **Summary:** Prescriptive approaches to energy sources diet and exercise should be avoided in favor of individualized practices. What works for one person may not work for another, and even seemingly negative experiences can fuel creativity. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** I tend to stay away from prescriptions around energetic sources diet or exercise because they're very personal. I predominantly stay away from dogma in those categories because there are lots of things that I've discovered that don't fit into a traditional view. For example, I've had some of the best ideas ever and acted on them when I've had the most horrendous hangovers that a human can ever have. I think hardcore sleep deprivation is one of the greatest creative fuels, used sparingly. But once in a while, that's available to anybody. You just can't do it all the time. The stimulus and the season matter a lot. That's why I don't buy into a lot of good/bad binaries around a lot of health and a lot of the pieces. They're all useful. Drugs, they've all got a place for the individual in the season or the stimulus, or they don't because, equally, many of those things that I say will work for me will harm somebody else. ## The Value of Ancient Wisdom and Personal Application **Summary:** Explore ancient texts religious scriptures and the Tao Te Ching for wisdom about flow and the universe's workings. Apply these teachings to your life and distill them for personal relevance. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** I believe it's really useful to read one of the major religious texts and have one. I've got a copy of all the major religious texts. I read the Bible pretty frequently. I think it's an amazing source of wisdom. I believe in God, not the God that's mentioned and not the God that Christianity identifies with. I believe in God, but I believe in *a* God. I believe in God, not *our* God. In terms of my understanding bridging to application, the Tao Te Ching was probably the most helpful in terms of talking about flow and talking about how the universe wants to operate and how it does. Anything that's old and has stood the test of time is worth applying. All of my discoveries are through consuming really old wisdom and then applying it and then distilling it. I'll come across stuff that matches my belief because someone's come to the same conclusion as me, when I first read Reality Transurfing. I was, 
> "Oh,

He talks about lucid dreaming and some other stuff that I'm not familiar with and haven't practiced. But I will read these things, and then I'm, "Oh, this validates my worldview," and I go, "Oh, well, okay, this applies to me." I then avoid it because I don't want… I don't need and want to be right on this stuff. I just need to know what the application is for me. So everything that I tap here is ancient. ## The Power of Stillness and Unfiltered Knowing **Summary:** Doing absolutely nothing and sitting in stillness for extended periods can lead to profound insights and a deeper connection with unfiltered knowledge that arises from within. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** The other recommendation, and I've done this twice, is doing absolutely nothing, sitting in one spot for one to two hours a day for about two months. The best book you'll ever read. nothing. No computer. Just sit there with a notepad. For me, after about 35 minutes, stuff starts coming where you cannot consciously identify where it comes from. This is where I talk about the knowing that just comes up into your consciousness unfiltered. It will either catch you… it will probably initiate a lot of emotion. It could be… I've heard of people, and I had a couple of experiences with it, where it was almost psychedelic, almost visual to a level of seeing things. It's interesting. Something is coming up and through that we don't allow to come through because we have stacked so much stuff around us. Even the thought of sitting there for an hour in a chair with no interruptions seems mentally punishing. I've tried meditation and all those things for long periods of time, and none of them worked for me. But just honestly sitting there for an hour or one to two hours changed a lot. ## The Daily Practice: Flipping Negative States **Summary:** Instead of rigid routines, focus on a daily practice of immediately flipping negative emotional states – worry, fatigue, indecision, frustration – into their positive counterparts. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** What has never worked for me is having a daily practice. I tried everything. What has never worked for me is having this, "I'm going to do this for 30 minutes," or "I'm going to do this for that," apart from sitting there and doing absolutely nothing, which was a practice in itself. The idea that I was going to journal for a certain amount of time and do this meditation for 20 minutes, those things never worked for me. It wasn't until my daily practice of isolating and identifying predominantly those four states and making the daily practice of turning them around immediately that that daily practice started to pay dividends and move forward. They're 24/7 of turning around any worry or any indecisiveness and practicing the flip of all those as quickly as possible. ## From Fatigue to Energy: Fake It Till You Make It **Summary:** Combat fatigue by "faking" energy and engaging in movement. This creates evidence of your inherent energy and disproves the belief that you lack it. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** What's my flip for fatigue to energy? Honestly, deciding… the thing that I will fake it till I make it is energy because I've found with the things that I find important, I always have enough energy for those things. If I go, "I'm tired," those things might be objectively true, but I've got the energy to do the things that I find important. So with fatigue, my true "fake it until you make it" thing is, "Get my body up, do the thing." I make energy through movement. If I'm low energy, I'll go sit on the bike for 20 minutes, and I'll make energy, which is just breaking the belief of the idea that I lack any

- ## Creating a $100k Community: Product and Offer Strategy **Summary:** This session focuses on creating a community-based offer that generates $100k in revenue. James Kemp emphasizes the importance of clear promises, actionable plans, and strategic pricing tiers to maximize both client acquisition and revenue generation. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Morning peeps. I need to take a stance on these otters and the rooms. You end up interacting with otters and AI pilots more than you do with humans. I've got a doc for you as usual. Bear with me on resolution. So, $100k community, today we're going to talk about product and offer. I want to direct us more towards doing in these things rather than, dare I say, mental masturbation. The philosophy is important, but that's consumed by the learning and the doing. Today is about product and offer, next week, validating it with the founding members frame. Week 3 is next steps. Even those with existing community offers could do with sharpening. Results are always relative. How fast you get results comes from what you already have, and what work you're about to do. Sales are a product of 3 factors: audience (60%), offer (30%), and copy (10%). The audience is a product of what you've done before. The offer is how clear, relevant, and timely it is. Clarity is what promises it makes, relevance is how relevant that promise is right now, and timing can leverage trends. Copy is just the words you use. A receptive audience and a clear offer will take you 90% of the way there quickly. Your offer is your offer, relational to your marketplace and audience. Why community? Four reasons: monetizing an audience (most of your audience hasn't bought from you), a home for your stuff (reduces decision fatigue), ascending clients (easy start point), and taking prospects off the market. Economics: our goal is $100k from a community. In the sovereign system, we have clients, customers, and leads. We get leads, turn them into customers, and turn customers into clients. Some people will pay 50 times more than others. Economics comes from paying in full for 12 months and clients signing into higher tiers. The path to $100k is unlikely to be 20 people at $100/week. It's likely to be a mix: some at $100/week, some paying $3k for 12 months upfront, and some at a higher tier ($300/week). If you have a big audience, a straight community level can work. But to maximize revenue, a higher tier is essential. A community has 3 components: content, the community itself, and customization. The simplest model is tier one ($100/week) with a training portal, community platform, and customization (group calls). Tier 2 is for those who want to go faster, including done-for-you components. If you have an existing high-ticket program, insert the community below it. The community offer is 12 months. ## Defining Your Core Offer and Crafting Compelling Promises **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of focusing on a single core benefit in your offer. James explains how to articulate the promise and plan of your offer to resonate with your target audience and drive conversions. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Four reasons people buy: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Everything outside the core reason is a benefit. I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. Your core piece stems from your own beliefs. While I say a lot of things, I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. As you get more experienced, you deliver more benefits

> "I want your support in getting offers pumping out cash without me having to crank the handle myself. Our goal is building a $3k offer that you take to $3k per week clockwork."
 The plan: 
> "We will install the sovereign system, talk about the client offer, customer offers, and then install the daily client machine."
 The promise, the plan, and the phases. This offer lives and dies on this page. Everything else is logistics. Price is relevant to value. $100/week. What's the risk? Weekly frame, come in, can leave. I choose no guarantees, promises, or refunds. Guarantees are a product of trust perception. The more track record you have, the less you need a guarantee. ## Maximizing Community Economics and the Hybrid Offer Approach **Summary:** James discusses strategies for maximizing community revenue, including offering annual payments with bonuses and utilizing the hybrid offer model to present multiple tiers without confusing potential clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We use the $100/week as a hook. Getting payment upfront is preferable. The average $100/week person stays 15-18 weeks, worth $1500-$1800. If we get $3000 upfront, we get cash upfront and they're more committed. I have a $3900 annual offer with a one-on-one call. This converts at 30%. To maximize conversions, I'd offer it at $2500-$3000. Offering $2500 annually is over a 50% discount. We use pricing to incentivize and collect cash. The hybrid offer sells the first tier without harming conversion to the client offer. 
> "You're receiving regular workshops and 24/7 access. Beyond that, have an option for my personal help. Members can upgrade or I can build you a custom plan to take an offer from $3k to $3k/week to $3k/day."
 The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."

# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 1

## # Processed Transcript ## Introduction & Welcome Hey! Peeps

# Processed Transcript ## Introduction & Welcome Hey! Peeps. I seem to have zoom open twice. I don't even know how that's possible, but it's working. Just wait a minute while you'll roll in. I'll drop the usual in the chat. It's about the dock and this one is going to expand as we go along, so add add some ads and other things as we go along, because it's a pretty dynamic dynamic funnel. So the daily client machine how's that for size? The the font. Good. I know these Google docs are good, good, good. So. Jim Tyrrell: Good enough. James Kemp: Good enough, that's all we need. So daily flight machine coming up to coming up to 7 years old in terms of in terms of a concept and the market is the same and different in many ways. But what hasn't changed is that, market dynamics are exactly that the distribution of a market is exactly that so client serving businesses are set up to serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace won't become a client. and over a long enough time period. If we quote unquote nurture people long enough and stay consistent, then clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. And what you find is that on average people will. turn one to 5% of their audience., and that's a broad metric into a client. So, you get a thousand people. You get a thousand leads, and, over time you get 10 to 30 clients out of a pretty common ratios. And there's 2 issues with this that it's really inefficient. If you're not selling to 990 or 970 people that you've, got the attention of, captured the details off and got the permission to talk to. Then that's it's a large portion of wastage.

## The Problem with Long Sales Cycles and the other factor is that there is no determinant of how long it's going to take. I've had scenarios where I've generated a lead 5 years ago before someone did that. If that was a planned sales cycle, then fine. I'm not a real estate agent, and I'd it to be a little bit shorter. Long sales. Cycles are very hard to scale. and so to get things to grow or to have control over something. We need something that is scalable because scale is a byproduct of, control. If we want to scale something up, we have to have control over something that works. And if we want to scale something down, we have to have the control over it as well. So we must have efficient ways to to identify who is most likely to become a client as early as possible. plus. It's useful to generate cash along the way as you invest to grow anything we need to invest, we need to invest time, or we need to invest money. We need to invest energy in both of those. And so as we go along, it's useful to generate cash flow from the energy that we put into our content our marketing, our lead generation, our advertising and everything in that category. And the power ladder is, undefeated that one to, for most people 3% is the number one to 3% of people in your audience, become a client, and will give you large amounts of money and will agree to have a level of transformation. There are people who just get coaching get mentorship do that consistently over long periods of time. They value being in proximity to people who are doing similar things to them. And they understand that. That's how you progress. It's much less about the things you do. It's about the people you're around and the other factor is that there is no determinant of how long it's going to take. I've had scenarios where I've generated a lead 5 years ago before someone did that. If that was a planned sales cycle, then fine. I'm not a real estate agent, and I'd it to be a little bit shorter. Long sales. Cycles are very hard to scale. and so to get things to grow or to have control over something. We need something that is scalable because scale is a byproduct of, control.

## Audience Segmentation & Lead Generation coming down from that. There are people who will invest intermittently. . They might buy a program here, an event here, a short coaching course, here a mastermind, and come into a free period and come out. Those people, are there. They are valuable to you, and you are valuable to them on the journey, and I see a lot of people going and talking, or being coached by one of my friends, and then coming back to me, and then going away again to do something else. And and they we don't have a linear path, but they are in my world for months and years. and then we have everybody else who will buy things spasmodically. They'll buy things occasionally, or they'll buy one thing and never buy another thing. But they might stick around in your audience, and there might be people who a big advocate of you I've got. I can think of lots of scenarios and people who fit these criteria. And so traditional lead generation has just been a game of large numbers, feed a thousand people on the top, nurture them while each one drops off. Get 30 clients at the other end if you could. and it's pretty wasteful, and it's pretty inefficient, and over time as we're seeing now. And a lot of people, especially if you're selling money or transformation fitness coaching as well. It's just harder because there's more people doing it. There's more, there's more cynicism, there's more blindness in the market, and it's just harder to to. It's harder to get clients. It's harder to capture attention. It's harder to differentiate. And over time no systems that waste most of their output have stood the test of time.

---

## The Dual-Mode Funnel Concept And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, download a lead magnet, and, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, people, are always looking for the best funnel. And, one of my most annoying phrases is, everything works right but who it's for? And when are the other determinants? And searching for the best funnel is is one of those endless ones when the constraints are predetermined. So the traditional lead generation of get a lead nurture, nurture, nurture. Watch people drop off and get a client works. It still works. but it's hard to scale. It's expensive. You need to be very good. And and ultimately it's not going to work forever. So something I've been working on for the past couple of months is bringing the 2 distinct approaches together. So dual mode client generation is a singular idea, deployed in in the same funnel with 2 different funnel types. So what we really want is clients, right? We can use those who won't immediately become clients to fund our marketing to get clients. That's the I think it's a little bit of a black pill. That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you . There are lots of people who are going to buy low ticket products from you, and will never become a client, but they'll give you cash flow to go and find clients right? So what we really want is clients. And what we really want is that the efficient way to do that? So this funnel monetizes IP that we've already got, we can use those who who won't immediately become clients to fund the acquisition of them, and we shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness of prospects. And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, download a lead magnet, and, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, people, are always looking for the best funnel. And, one of my most annoying phrases is, everything works right but who it's for? And when are the other determinants? And searching for the best funnel is is one of those endless ones when the constraints are predetermined. So the traditional lead generation of get a lead nurture, nurture, nurture. Watch people drop off and get a client works. It still works. but it's hard to scale. It's expensive. You need to be very good. And and ultimately it's not going to work forever. So something I've been working on for the past couple of months is bringing the 2 distinct approaches together. So dual mode client generation is a singular idea, deployed in in the same funnel with 2 different funnel types. So what we really want is clients, right? We can use those who won't immediately become clients to fund our marketing to get clients. That's the I think it's a little bit of a black pill. That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you . There are lots of people who are going to buy low ticket products from you, and will never become a client, but they'll give you cash flow to go and find clients right? So what we really want is clients

## Implementation Steps

## Two Buying Types: Insight vs. Info So in a dual mode funnel we generate leads and customers, at the same time using the same idea, so that this is not which one is best. They both serve roles right? The traditional Vsl based funnel that generates a lead and gives someone some insight has a place the more modern., low ticket info buying products leading to a place has a place one isn't better than than the other. In certain circumstances, for for certain people one will outperform the other one, but they both have a role, and by using both at once we get the best of both worlds. So to understand why. which is important to me that you understand why these things work, below the strategic level is that there are lots of different ways that people buy stuff. Right? So I've identified 2 buying types that they both., fundamentally work on the same premise. We need people to consume our ideas and us to buy into them. Right? We need to sell people ideas before we sell them anything we need to people to buy into our ideas, to buy into working with us, and the key word, and which is not often used in the design and deployment of, lead generation and funnels is consume because one path a buyer can take is consuming information, deriving insight on how it could work for them. Then, taking the next step to put the insight into action. the other is purchasing information consuming it. Then taking the next step presented in the chain. So I gave an example recently where I had bought, quote unquote high ticket services from 2 different people in 2 different ways, one by going through a traditional funnel and watching some information and then reaching out to them, and the other by buying their products, consuming the contents of the products. And then, taking the next step and engaging their services right? Both of these types of consumption have a have different advantages. Free information has a distribution advantage putting content out on the Internet. So in a dual mode funnel we generate leads and customers, at the same time using the same idea, so that this is not which one is best. They both serve roles right? The traditional Vsl based funnel that generates a lead and gives someone some insight has a place the more modern., low ticket info buying products leading to a place has a place one isn't better than than the other. In certain circumstances, for for certain people one will outperform the other one, but they both have a role, and by using both at once we get the best of both worlds. So to understand why. which is important to me that you understand why these things work, below the strategic level is that there are lots of different ways that people buy stuff. Right? So I've identified 2 buying types that they both., fundamentally work on the same premise. We need people to consume our ideas and us to buy into them. Right? We need to sell people ideas before we sell them anything we need to people to buy into our ideas, to buy into working with us, and the key word, and which is not often used in the design and deployment of, lead generation and funnels is consume because one path a buyer can take is consuming information, deriving insight on how it could work for them. Then, taking the next step to put the insight into action. the other is purchasing information consuming it. Then taking the next step presented in the chain. So I gave an example recently where I had bought, quote unquote high ticket services from 2 different people in 2 different ways, one by going through a traditional funnel and watching some information and then reaching out to them, and the other by buying their products, consuming the contents of the products. And then, taking the next step and engaging their services right? Both of these types of consumption have a have different advantages. Free information has a distribution advantage putting content out on the Internet.

## Examples & Case Studies

## The Power of a Singular Idea in Dual Modes It's more likely to be consumed than it is. If it's behind a paywall paid information has attention and attention advantage. If people pay, they tend to pay attention right? And so putting information and insight in front of people using both at the same time, is the force multiplier. And this, gets above that. What is the one funnel. There isn't 1 funnel. There is understanding the principles behind, a singular idea, being deployed and deploying it in different modes. So the Dcm 2.0 deploys both at the same time. and we create the same. We take the same idea and create 2 funnels. Each funnel leads to an offer. The client. Funnel uses an insight path. So consumption of information, and the customer funnel uses an info path. Purchasing and consuming information right? So as always, it's much simpler to show you rather than tell you so. One of the things that is the most challenging with offers right when we're making offers is what precedes the offer? What happens around the offer that you're making? And we, when we look at Google Docs, we often look at the the offer. That's inside the Google Doc. But we need to understand what's happened before that. And we also need to understand what's happened after it as well. That's my, both my zooms going off at once. So the client funnel works with both organic content and paid traffic right? So the top of the funnel we have content and pre-selling content is about 2 different things. It's about consistency and understanding that there's only really 3 content types that we're putting out there. So pre-selling content does exactly that. It pre- sells them on. What can happen next. So the content types are our mechanisms. I will talk about the hybrid offer. I will show how it works. I'll give different examples to it. I will talk about the daily client machine. I'll show how it works. I'll give different examples to it.

## Content Strategy & World Building This pre-sells people on the ideas that these things work and gives them insight that it might work for them right? And so the other top content types are, the identity I talk about the sovereign consultant. I talk about the sovereign components and and the process, and especially with video based content. You are showing those things as well rather than just telling right? So where are you? What is the background? What world are you in. What's your philosophy? Who's around you? What is the day in the life, what is behind the scenes? Who are the characters? If you're on a refresher on those things, then it's in the authority training in the, in the membership. So the world building is., the things around you, and though they can be, stories, I do, stop marketing, start demonstrating as me, just talking about my experience and pointing something out and giving inside philosophy online coaching is dead. But there's lots of things that are more mechanistic here as well. That content, if we're doing it from a content way, then funnels them to a big idea. Video. And this is for all intents and purposes of Vsl. I don't call it a Vsl, because I have found. There's no actual formula that applies to each individual. There are particular formulas that apply to certain categories. If you're just selling coaching, there's a particular formula for that. If you're just selling agency, there's a particular formula for a Vsl that works really well, and a lot of those Vsls to be honest work very well in call funnels, but less well in insight funnels. So I frame my, big idea as a demo.

## Creating Your "Big Idea" Video (VSL) a demo of a system, the exact steps X and Y exhibit. So one of the key things here is, use the style that's native to you. My style is, I will formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver on my training. I'll formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver offers. And I'll formulate a Google Doc to also, use in my marketing. So a Google, Doc is native to the way that I work and the way I present, and the way I think. And so it's the native thing for me. I have a friend who uses, slides because that's how he does it. And he, draws on paper, and he draws on an ipad. I have a friend who goes piece straight to camera with no. no props or anything that, because that's how he does it, and that's how he delivers. And that's how his training work. So the net the native style is., is is native to you. For me, it's Google Docs, one of the dirty secrets about big ideas or Vsls, the headline drives 50% of the conversion. We only really need people to watch a couple of minutes of something to get them to take action, because the headline has framed whether they are interested and whether it's relevant to them at exact. At that exact time a lot of testing in these funnels goes back to the media, whereas the headline is the the thing that it says at the top of the page drives most of the the attention and the activity off the back of it. a demo of a system, the exact steps X and Y exhibit. So one of the key things here is, use the style that's native to you. My style is, I will formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver on my training. I'll formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver offers. And I'll formulate a Google Doc to also, use in my marketing. So a Google, Doc is native to the way that I work and the way I present, and the way I think. And so it's the native thing for me. I have a friend who uses, slides because that's how he does it.

And that's how his training work. So the net the native style is. you know, is is native to you. For me, it's Google Docs, one of the dirty secrets about big ideas or Vsls, the headline drives 50% of the conversion. We only really need people to watch a couple of minutes of something to get them to take action, because the headline has framed whether they are interested and whether it's relevant to them at exact. At that exact time a lot of testing in these funnels goes back to the media, whereas the headline is the the thing that it says at the top of the page drives most of the the attention and the activity off the back of it.

## Driving Conversations & Case Studies The the thing we're looking for is no more than a couple of minutes of consumption. And a big idea Video, if you've introduced it, and you've got the gist. Then people, can can get enough of the idea. There is at the start. We want to put a lot of volume through a big idea video. So when I launch one of these videos, I just have a button there which enables people to start chatting with me straight away. I want to have conversations with people. I'm not gonna automate anything. I'm not gonna put anything in the way to . try and qualify, or anything that. I just want to talk to people. Who are they? Why do they click it? Where are they now? Am I useful to them. And the the other major point is, use the messaging platform that's native to you. I used to use Facebook and Facebook messenger when when I get people to reach out. I'm barely on Facebook these days, so it would be a mistake to use it. So I send people to an Instagram chat. Or I can send people to email as well, which tends to be my preference. Preference these days. So I'm, I've I've this this video. Here was 44 min. I've got another one. That's 11. These worked for me because they're in their native format. Excuse me. then, we're, giving people a case study. It's the same idea. It's the same core concepts. But we're giving it, as as a 3rd party. insight is delivered via demonstration. People are saying, Okay, well, it works for James. Then can it works for this other guy, then can it work for me? So the follow up of that content is, show transformation by showing how the transformation is made. The same point that I use in the ultimate case study.

# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 4

. James Kemp: It's healthy to. It's healthy to follow urine. I'm, I know, the book works and things haven't magically changed. So we're gonna we're just gonna put it on the shelf for a bit and then come back to it. James Kemp: And then, when the algorithm, gives you the gift James Kemp: and it works in the 1st few days, then it keeps going, and then you can feed it with creative. James Kemp: But it needs to. It needs something needs to happen in the 1st 72 h. James Kemp: Otherwise you just may as well pull it all down and start again. Adam Franklin: Right? Okay, so don't keep persevering. If there's not much traction in those 1st 3 days. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, just give it a rest. Come back with maybe some different angles and different creative. James Kemp: . And and I'm talking about offers that you that, work or should work, and. Adam Franklin: Has it worked with your list? James Kemp: They've worked before, or someone else has got them working right. James Kemp: there are. There's an offer out there that's yours. James Kemp:, with a slightly different twist on it that, and it's been running for a long time, and you go and look, and that the ads are months old or those things. And you're, Okay, I can get that working. James Kemp: You're just looking for the angle James Kemp: mine. The hybrid offer especially needed James Kemp: needed a frame of who it was, for before it would really James Kemp: catch right? It was working. James Kemp: but I didn't have the. This is for these people. This is for coaches is for consultants is for agency, and as soon as that was in the, in the copy and in the framing. Then the cost per the cost per acquisition dropped a lot and the the funnel was working. It's just the the acquisition was a little bit too high to go too far James Kemp: while while the while the actual funnel is working. So it just need a little frame of who it's for. Adam Franklin: And so that's where you landed on coach consultant agency owner. James Kemp: Yeah. Adam Franklin: Okay. James Kemp: You were James Kemp: You are going to spend money testing. Adam Franklin: Yeah. James Kemp: Right. Adam Franklin: And what's a reasonable amount if something looks at 50 bucks a day? Is that a reasonable amount in your experience, or should it be higher or lower. James Kemp: I think you could. James Kemp: I start with $500, but I can do that right. I don't think that thinking in a daily in a daily James Kemp: way is particularly healthy because it's arbitrary. James Kemp: I I the frame of. James Kemp: If I set this $2,000 on fire, would it materially affect me? James Kemp: And if the answer is no, then that's how much you should spend on testing your funnel. Adam Franklin: Got it over. What timeframe would you say so? It's say it's an arbitrary $1,000 or $2,000 that you're prepared to test. James Kemp: Yeah, I'm gonna spend. I'm gonna spend 3 weeks doing this. I'm going to spend $2,000. And then at the end, I'm going to see what happens. I would have learned something. I would have looked at everything along the way. Adam Franklin: Okay. And that's something that you tend to do yourself. Or do you have a agency or a partner that that looks over. James Kemp: I'll always get a funnel going myself

. I'm gonna spend 3 weeks doing this. I'm going to spend $2,000. And then at the end, I'm going to see what happens. I would have learned something. I would have looked at everything along the way. Adam Franklin: Okay. And that's something that you tend to do yourself. Or do you have a agency or a partner that that looks over. James Kemp: I'll always get a funnel going myself. And then nowadays the creative demands of James Kemp: The creative demands of the funnel are just something I don't want to deal with. So I get someone to take over. And, media buying these days is James Kemp: moved away from which audiences do you choose to. How much creative can you feed it into the right audiences? James Kemp: So you need someone who's going to produce reasonable high level, we're we're launching new ads every Monday. Adam Franklin: Right? Adam Franklin: Are you finding Facebook and Instagram, or the platforms? Or do you go broader than that in your own personal experience? James Kemp:, Meta is, Meta has just got James Kemp: unlimited amounts of people to to go to. Right? Yeah. And so James Kemp: the creative requirements are still relatively low. You can do static ads with text. You can do video. So Youtube and those those platforms just have a higher creative requirement and a higher and a higher learning curve for most people. James Kemp: So those require more investment. Adam Franklin: Okay. Adam Franklin: And then the resources you put in the in the in the Google, Doc, I don't suppose you could copy that link in again, or I can just wait for the for the replay. But those you said you did do it in high level are those Adam Franklin: pages and templates that you've shared? Are they snapshots we can install? Or do we just go in and and replicate them ourselves on our end? James Kemp: That's a that's a snapshot you can install in Ghl. Adam Franklin: Oh, great, fabulous! Thank you!

## Q&A: The Importance of Differentiation & Creativity James Kemp: The the creative. We've talked about this a bit. And, office hours and the circle calls this week is the creative requirement. Adam Franklin: And these categories and the businesses that we're in. James Kemp: Isn't just the things people look at and images and those things. It's creative. Requirement is is differentiation. James Kemp: Bye, the barriers to entry in almost every James Kemp: coaching, consulting agency services category have just dropped into the floor. James Kemp: Anyone can do and say whatever they on the Internet. And this means that people have James Kemp: fatigue on a lot of different levels. They have offer fatigue, they have face fatigue, they have idea, fatigue. James Kemp: and the the crazier you are the easier it is now, because you will James Kemp: see and do, and feel and say and present things that other people don't have access to, and James Kemp: the one of the declines in performance of advertising is because the speed to copy everybody else is just ramped up to infinity. Right as soon as you launch something good. If people are watching you, someone else will launch almost the identical thing. James Kemp: and that will James Kemp: it does. It has a dual. It's a duality it educates the market. And so maybe it's good, but it also induces fatigue in the market because they're seeing the same idea. James Kemp: said the same way by different people. And they people just get blindness right? James Kemp: And so the creative requirement James Kemp: that the burden on all of us now is to be different right? And the irony James Kemp: is that the more time you spend in places this, the more time you spend looking at what your friends, colleagues, peers, competitors, and those things are, are doing, the harder it is to be creative. Adam Franklin: And. James Kemp: Over over time for me. James Kemp: My best ideas have come from adjacent markets, or taking b 2 c ideas to b 2 b, or taking concepts, and one plus one equals 9 by taking concepts from different places and introducing them into the marketplaces and the places you operate in. James Kemp: which is all to say. James Kemp: The more you try and follow. James Kemp: I understand. That's why I always try and present the principles and the thinking behind these things rather than just. This is what to do. James Kemp: Because if you just stick on, the this is what to do, and these are the tactics. And this is what to say, and those things James Kemp: that it won't work by default because James Kemp: everybody else is saying it, and everybody else is doing it, and everybody else is saying it in exactly the same way. James Kemp: and James Kemp: some of the measures that people have to take, especially sensitive people who absorb everything and are looking at what everybody else is doing. James Kemp: Some of the measures that people have to take to deprogram themselves from of doing the same thing in the same way, and saying the same stuff, and then getting annoyed that it doesn't work are extreme. James Kemp: So we do, which is all to say, understand the principles, follow the the pattern, but introduce James Kemp: your own process to it. Your own, essence to it, and and those things, and James Kemp: I'm increasingly reluctant to James Kemp: in many ways give scripts. And what exactly do I say in this? And what exactly do I say in that? James Kemp: Because if I'm giving them to 100 people at once. James Kemp: I'm just further perpetuating there their James Kemp: the the averageness, because that's that's what it returns to in the mean

## Q&A: Identity vs. Outcome in Marketing Adam Franklin: Are you still finding that it's the identity that people are Adam Franklin: buying into as well when it comes to, offers the identity that they can become more so than the the skill that they're acquiring, or the specific outcome that they're acquiring? Adam Franklin: Or is the identity part of tied into it baked into it, but less explicit. James Kemp: I think this is where the depth of power laws is much deeper than how much money people will give you, and how much they'll invest James Kemp: is is what's their transformational type? Right? James Kemp: There are. James Kemp: There are a tiny number of people. James Kemp: but proportionately in each category. Who are, we'll invest into transformation based James Kemp: programs and engagements and coaching and true mentorship James Kemp: because they understand proximity is how James Kemp: changes my name. Who am I around what environment I'm in, not, what am I being taught? James Kemp: There's is a very large cohort of people who are still stuck James Kemp: in the information age. Right? If I just get more information and buy more information. Then I'll have some breakthrough James Kemp: right? James Kemp: And so the nature of how people buy and why they buy James Kemp: hasn't really changed. Just our ability to differentiate between those people has. And this is where it's useful to understand what you're selling to people. James Kemp: A lot of people don't want coaching and don't want new skills. James Kemp: They just want to be plugged in James Kemp: to the matrix and just given all this stuff. James Kemp: There's a there's a a number of people who James Kemp: can't not do it, and they will buy transformation and coaching and masterminds. And James Kemp: that's just what they do right. James Kemp: I don't really care who is in a mastermind. I care who's in it. James Kemp: I don't care who what I'm going to be taught. I care who I get to hang around, and who I get to be near, because that's where the that's where true transformation happens or true insight happens. James Kemp: So yeah, I think there's James Kemp: there'll be. There's a return in many ways, memberships, James Kemp: masterminds, and people who understand proximity, and people who don't, who'll buy info James Kemp: identity is and mature markets, and or will always transcend James Kemp: strategic or or outcome-based promises over time, because James Kemp: how many times have you seen James Kemp: make a hundred KA month? James Kemp: How many times have you say 19 KA month? James Kemp: How many times have you seen that it to the point where it loses all meaning. James Kemp: and so identity, and who someone who someone becomes will transcend that over the long, over the long term? James Kemp: Who do you want to be. Adam Franklin: As sorry Adam Franklin: that identity is more more than just about the dollars. Is it. James Kemp: Always. Yeah. James Kemp: Molester. Adam Franklin: Cool. Adam Franklin: Thank you. James Kemp: Yeah, the money and different types can always be used, as, helps to get attention. James Kemp: But over over the long term. James Kemp: the underlying question that most people have is, Who will I become if I, if I James Kemp: put my beliefs into this and and ultimately invest in it. Adam Franklin: Thank you.

## Implementation Steps

## Q&A: Workshopping a Product Idea (DCM) James Kemp: Hi, Tom. Tom Rolley: Hey, James, how's it going. James Kemp: Good. Tom Rolley: I was wondering if we could workshop a potential product through the Dcm Tom Rolley: and just see how you'd approach that. So the, it's a workshop recording. It was called Map your custom journey, and the purpose was to identify the constraint in the business so that they would know which thing to fix Tom Rolley: so yeah, just wondering how you'd approach that from A from this? Dcm, where do I? Where do I start? What do I build. How do I? How do I look at it to get it up? And running. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have. James Kemp: So do does the target market know what a customer journey is. Tom Rolley: Oh, gee, maybe. But probably not Tom Rolley: they. Yeah, I'm guessing they probably they're probably just overwhelmed with the amount of stuff going on in their business, and they probably wouldn't recognize that those words. James Kemp: So in the in the realm of the customer. What's the primary problem that they want solved today? Tom Rolley: I think, they're probably they're they're looking for either, increased profits or increased revenue. And then they're not sure what they're trying lots of things, but nothing much is working. And they're just unsure about what even the problem is is most likely. James Kemp: Exactly. James Kemp: That market category isn't good for info products. They're good for insight. James Kemp: Right? Once you catch their attention, you can, show how how to work those things out. And how do you get your top 3 priorities and get them a plan? James Kemp: But they're not good, for info James Kemp: info is good for people who already have James Kemp: something that they feel they need to solve. They're just looking for the the mechanism to do it. Tom Rolley: Okay. So hence, if they don't know what a customer journey is, then it doesn't make any sense for them to to. James Kemp: So the way to frame a customer related journey thing is how to get. James Kemp: how to get the the template, to send to your customers today to get 81% back into your business in the next 30 days. Right? James Kemp: Because they've the the repeat business. The instant. Repeat business, template. James Kemp: how to send this, get clients. James Kemp: get money, etc. It's easy. It's, Okay. James Kemp: I want more repeat business. So I'm going to buy this, so I can use it straight away. Tom Rolley: Okay? And and that's the insight one rather than the. James Kemp: That's an info . Tom Rolley: That's the info. Okay, cool. James Kemp: With with the hybrid offer. I'm saying to people, you're selling an expensive thing on the telephone right now take this template. Put the thing you're selling into into this and sell it without the call. James Kemp: And they're, because they're they've got the thing they've got the offer. James Kemp: and they've got. They're they're running a process that they don't . James Kemp: They're doing sales calls. Tom Rolley: Okay, so where do I take that for the for this customer journey thing, should I just Tom Rolley: throw it in the bin. James Kemp: Element of the customer journey

. James Kemp: And they're, because they're they've got the thing they've got the offer. James Kemp: and they've got. They're they're running a process that they don't . James Kemp: They're doing sales calls. Tom Rolley: Okay, so where do I take that for the for this customer journey thing, should I just Tom Rolley: throw it in the bin. James Kemp: Element of the customer journey. It sounds very high level rather than . Tom Rolley: So that the the outcome is they can see the each stage of their business, and then they can clear. They ordered it and go. Oh, okay, well, we're dropping off here. that that there was, 8 18 people going into a sales call and one sale being made, and they were expecting a 30%. And so it was clear that that was the broken bit. Tom Rolley: So what do they do about that about one of them that I do. James Kemp: What do they do? Tom Rolley: What do they do? Well, then, they it's been mixed up Tom Rolley: piece rather than fixing more leads or more advertising that it was, oh, this is this is the broken bit fix that. So they they knew which bit to fix rather than just. James Kemp: A good info product zooms in on that bit. It says if people aren't turning up to your sales calls or your sales calls aren't converting at more than 30%. Do this. James Kemp: A good info product zooms in on that bit. It says if people aren't turning up to your sales calls or your sales calls aren't converting at more than 30%. Do this. Tom Rolley: Okay. James Kemp: So it talks that a good info product talks to a known problem. Tom Rolley: Okay? All right. So they have to know the problem that they've got the problem first.st And then they're, Okay, cool. This, this is the solve. James Kemp: Yeah. Otherwise, otherwise, an info product is going to spend a lot of time trying to educate people James Kemp: on that. This is the problem rather than just buying it. James Kemp: So an info product works best on a market where the the knowledge of the problem is already there. Tom Rolley: Okay. James Kemp: An insight as different because that customer journey piece James Kemp: may work very well as an insight based video which, watch this. And then you'll analyze this, and then I'll help you with James Kemp: help you with fixing that problem. James Kemp: Okay, cool. Got it James Kemp: in terms of the . If you want to know how to use that specific thing. James Kemp: That's how you'd. That's how you'd utilize it. Tom Rolley: Okay, so that would be more the Vsl, the open Vsl piece that you discussed. Okay, cool. All right. Got it. James Kemp: And then framing it. James Kemp: how we get how we double the revenue from existing customer bases without getting any new leads and and spending money on marketing, or something that. Tom Rolley: So yeah, got it. Got it? Tom Rolley: Alright. Cool. James Kemp: Because. Tom Rolley: Thank you. James Kemp: An insight based funnel will by nature educate people about, talk to pains. James Kemp: talk to problems, present solutions, and then say, do you want to fix them. James Kemp: whereas info funnel is, you've got a problem. James Kemp: Here's something that solves that problem. James Kemp: I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. You've probably got another problem James Kemp: would

. Tom Rolley: Thank you. James Kemp: An insight based funnel will by nature educate people about, talk to pains. James Kemp: talk to problems, present solutions, and then say, do you want to fix them. James Kemp: whereas info funnel is, you've got a problem. James Kemp: Here's something that solves that problem. James Kemp: I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. You've probably got another problem James Kemp: would. I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. Hey? Do you want help solving all these problems at once? We should work together. Tom Rolley: And daily client machine is only info, or Tom Rolley: is it inside as well, can you . James Kemp: The new way of doing it. you're delivering those things both of those things at once, because they complement each other. James Kemp: The old way of doing it was, generating a lead, then trying to liquidate the customer, etc. But you only get one buying type James Kemp: right. And my. James Kemp: I've got high level clients who have come through both paths. They've watched videos. They've reached out to me James Kemp: right. And then I've got people who just bought and bought and bought and bought until we had the conversation of, Hey, do you just want to stop buying stuff and work together James Kemp: same people, but the path that they came through was distinct in terms of who they were, how they bought, and some people flick between different buying types based on timing in different ways, and some people only buy that certain way. James Kemp: Alright. James Kemp: I know people who never ever buy info products. James Kemp: and they won't buy any high ticket that way. And I also people who will not get on a call won't talk to someone won't watch a video that's longer than 30 seconds, and we'll just buy info products all day long and then go. I'm going to hire you for this. James Kemp: Right? They're different buying paths. Tom Rolley: Okay. Cool. James Kemp: And if we only use one of them, then we're limited on.

- ```txt ## The Universe Rewards Energy Stewards **Summary:** The universe rewards those who effectively manage and amplify energy. By believing in the universe's support and acting as a conduit for energy, individuals can attract abundance in various forms. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Everything in the universe is energy. This central belief has helped me more than any other, because I believe the universe has my back. It will give me more than I can imagine if I create and distribute energy in all forms. It's a simple belief: if I create and distribute energy, the universe will reward me with more energy in different forms. I am content because I make others feel content. I am rich because I make others rich. I am safe because I make others feel safe. I receive generously because I give generously. I'm an energetic being, and if I give and create energy to other energetic beings, then I will receive back energy in different forms. Why would the universe choose to give me anything other than abundance if I'm the perfect steward and creator of energy? The universe is going to give me more energy to let it flow through me. I make a lot of money because I also give away a lot of money. I am highly creative because I give away a lot of that creativity and allow space for more, and I'm rewarded with more creativity because I allow these things to flow through me. I steward them, I create them, I amplify them, and the universe has given me more of them. If you feel this divine entity that we live in, the universe, has your back, then anxiety feels pointless, useless, short-term, petty. It feels dishonorable and unworthy of your place in the universe, of the energetic being that you are. Feeling it becomes an insult to the plan. Cultivating this mindset doesn't take long when you believe in the idea of a benevolent universe. Some of the emotions people hold so tightly just look inconsequential, almost pitiful to me when I think about where we all sit in the grand design. ## Overcoming Worry, Fatigue, Indecision, and Frustration **Summary:** Worry, fatigue, indecision, and frustration are signals from your potential self urging you to change. By flipping these negative states into their positive counterparts – courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease – you align with your potential and the universe's flow. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** On a human plane, we dismiss worry, fatigue, indecision, and frustration as just part of life. But on a different timeline, they don't exist. If you are visited by these emotions, they are signals from your potential self to change. Your potential self, on the other timeline, is sending you signals, saying you are in a state you do not have to accept because I exist in this other state. When these negative states arrive, individually or together, step into the opposite state that exists on the potential timeline: courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease. This is the daily practice. When you feel any of those four, you can flip the script in the moment because that is already available to you on the other timeline. The flip is instantaneous because you already know, and it's already there. It's just the choice to flip it. The skill is the practice of flipping those when they arrive. You've already decided that the universe has your back, so it's dishonorable to sit in those negative places because the universe wants to reward you and rebalance. The universe is also dealing with all the other energetic beings who sit in those states all the time, and it says we need to rewrite the balance. We need to flip the script here. We need to rebalance by flipping this energetic being into one of these four states, or all of them at once. The universe wants to do that because it seeks balance

. The universe is also dealing with all the other energetic beings who sit in those states all the time, and it says we need to rewrite the balance. We need to flip the script here. We need to rebalance by flipping this energetic being into one of these four states, or all of them at once. The universe wants to do that because it seeks balance. It is doing it a disservice to inhabit a negative state. You're blocking its gifts. ## The Power of Belief and the Illusion of Truth **Summary:** What you believe is more important than what is objectively true. By believing in a benevolent universe and your role as a creator and distributor of energy, you create your own truth and attract the corresponding results. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Plenty of other people are going to inhabit negative states, so the universe wants to flip the script; it wants to reach balance. You cannot be wrong or misaligned if you operate from positive states. The universe will balance it out for you. Even if you make a perceived objectively wrong decision, that wrong decision will be made right if you stay in a positive state. The wrong decision will be made wrong if you make a decision from a state of decisiveness and then flip back to indecision. People flip between the states they're in. They flip between indecision and decision. They make a decision, then they flip back to indecision. So the universe doesn't make the decision right because they flip back to the other state. If you maintain the state of decisiveness, the universe just balances it out and rewards it. If you flip back to the indecisive state, then the universe flips it back and makes the previous decisive state wrong because it gives you evidence that it was previously wrong. The art is staying in the state of courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease as much as you can, and the universe will come back and reward those states. Operating from those states is natural; it puts you at one with the universe, in the flow. Then the only tension is external. ## Controlling the Mind and Surrendering to Knowing **Summary:** The mind needs to be right, so control it to define what "right" means for you. Surrender to your inner knowing, embrace the universe's support, and understand your potential exists on a different timeline, already realized. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** These concepts are great on a theoretical level, but they're difficult on a human level because of external sources and beliefs. If you don't believe that you already know, then you are right, and you'll block it. If you don't believe in a benevolent universe, then you are right, and it will give you that truth to prove you are right, that the universe doesn't have your back and wants to punish you. If you believe the current state is the only state you can operate in, that there isn't another state to flip to, then you are right, too. This is the central paradox: the mind needs to be right. So we must control the mind and ultimately control the spirit to enable what right means for us. Surrendering to the knowing that you already have within you and embracing that the universe has your back, understanding that the potential you have lives on another timeline, already there – these beliefs ultimately become true. This has been true for me and for the people I've helped install these ideas in their lives because they sit in a level of flow, which means the day-to-day things that previously stressed them out no longer do. ## Removing Need and Embracing the Abundance Mindset **Summary:** By removing need and not relying on external sources for validation or sustenance, you become a magnet for others seeking to fulfill their needs through you. This abundance mindset fosters genuine giving without expectation of return. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Removing need works better for males than females

. ## Removing Need and Embracing the Abundance Mindset **Summary:** By removing need and not relying on external sources for validation or sustenance, you become a magnet for others seeking to fulfill their needs through you. This abundance mindset fosters genuine giving without expectation of return. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Removing need works better for males than females. It means you don't need any external sources of energy or sustenance. You are your own being, and you don't need anything whatsoever. If you maintain that state, you will find that people will try and fulfill their needs through you. I get so many messages, emails, and long diatribes with people wanting stuff from me. I try to explain to them that it's because I don't really ask for anything and I don't profess any needs. I do not need anything from anybody ever. When needs pop up, I either deal with them myself or ask those close to me to help me fulfill those things. I got very good at asking, very good at receiving. Removing need helps, especially in an industry full of needy people. Many get into the expert industry to try and self-actualize, and they do it through the root of getting money, clients, prestige, and status. If you do it because you love the game, because it's fun, because you're giving energy back to the world, then you get much more of those things than anybody else, usually by many orders of magnitude. ## Stop Telling Stories and Embrace the Unknown **Summary:** Intelligent people often overthink and catastrophize potential outcomes. Instead of telling stories about the future, embrace the unknown and focus on controlling your inputs, not predicting the outputs. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Don't tell stories. This is the catastrophizing of all potential future outcomes that many intelligent people do. The more intelligent you are, the more stories you tell because your brain can abstract and posit second and third order consequences. Intelligent people tell the most stories because they believe they can possibly predict the maximum number of outcomes.
