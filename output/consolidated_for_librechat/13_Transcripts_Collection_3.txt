# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 14

it if there's no true genuine desire there yeah it's very difficult to acquire skills when you don't have desire behind them yeah it's very difficult to wear I really want to be good at this and I need to be good at this when there's no actual want deep inside you to want to do it well well I think we'll come back to this but this idea that business needs to be hard is a really prevalent one because I think business is already hard because we have to grow and gain skills and stick out things things and develop character traits that allow us to focus on one thing for a really long time but then people also make it unnecessarily hard they go well I'm not good at this so I must get better at it because I I don't want to have a weak Link in the chain I don't want to have a hole in the bucket but man we have friends who have great businesses and suck at huge parts of it right they either hire around themselves we have multi-millionaire friends who can barely tie their shoes yeah yeah yeah that's a reality yeah and I'm useless at some some very normal we talked about this with life admin right yeah I would way rather be hit with a hundred thousand dollar tax bill and have to figure that out over the next month then organize a youth camp the scale of of the problem is significantly different but the complexity or even just if you peel it back if I had to buy our groceries every week and things that it sounds so such a luxury but those things stress me out those everyday things but but so many entrepreneurs think they need a master at all I need to have all of the things me good at Marketing sales maybe the best dad the best husband and then that means I need to take all of the stereotypical things I need to be amazing at sitting down and playing with my kids with Lego for hours at a time I need to have the Lawns mode the Hedge trimmed whatever else but you bring that to business it's the same deal my take is that it's a product of weaponizing Shame right and it starts at a young age because we need the system needs people to be in a certain way and compliant with doing those things in productive and with weaponized shame and now we've Amplified it with this thing called the internet to say if you don't want things these things you're not normal then there's something wrong with you if you don't want to be this if you don't want to spend your days that if you don't believe these things then there's something morally wrong with you and we're going to shame you yeah and it's weaponized everywhere yeah and it's weaponized by people's Often by the people that are closest to the recipient of that shame right because they're you should want this I was asked by people who came to visit a couple of weeks ago as we're sitting in our house with our staff everybody here has local staff we have a family it's true guys and they're how do you feel about these people serving you and I was amazing amazing because this family have a house here they've got Vehicles they've got they send their kids to school that their son's getting a higher education because they work for me and they love my kids just they're their own it feels great but that's just one example of things to be well you shouldn't have people serve you yet as an entrepreneur your time time is the only scarce thing on earth unless you yield it properly with the skill set that you were either innately given and Amplified you are going to fail to create the most value you possibly can so you should be ashamed of doing the things you're bad at and doing the things that you shouldn't be doing because it's going to cost you and it's going to cost the people who depend on you yeah and this this is we'll get to it in a second but let's talk about Sam ovens because he went through that period which is what my mind is going to now but most people listening

.co.nz there's a picture of this Penthouse apartment I think it's 2014. he's right in the Auckland viaduct in the harbor he's got a zebra rug a motorcycle a pistol all of these Antiques and things that around this house and he's just the cool dude of Auckland but who was this guy that you met at that time so I was I was in that transition so I was still Consulting for the main the main guys and I was still acting marketing director but I wasn't employed by them so I was running I'm going out Consulting and I reached out to him because he'd been on Mexico oh yeah with SNAP inspect and his software company his software company at the time and I met this extremely confident it's not nose kid really that's what I thought when I walked away because he's he's 10 years 12 years younger than me yeah and I was big swinging dick I work for the fastest growing country and Company in the country you've got it all worked out but but I was enthralled by his confidence and his and his vision about I just do Consulting to generate cash flow to build the software company and at the time the software company was the main thing and then in a software company if anyone who doesn't know was an app for property managers property inspection probably inspection it was really good I'm not a property manager but it you can take fixtures and it solved a real pain problem it still exists and he's yeah since the interview lots of people reached out talk about because he he kind of alluded to this doing consulting to generate cash flow for other things or because that was this angle at the time and that's what he was doing and he said I'm starting a thing and at the time it was a Dropbox folder full of stuff and it was just putting online and kajabi and I signed up months later when it was a proper products do you remember all that those six grand six grand and this is twenty he did me a solid though he did it in New Zealand Dollars oh my man he did at the time that was very welcome yeah because I think six grand us at the time was 10 grand kiwi or something that yeah and he's dude don't tell anyone but I'll do it in kiwi dollars thanks bro yeah and this was 2014. 2015. oh it's later than that right no about 2015. yeah yeah it would be about 20 2014 2015

. so he's based in New Zealand Consulting is is a side hustle and you get into this Dropbox community of there's some trainings there's no Consulting accelerator that many people would have experienced later yeah and what was that experience because because at this point I imagine you're still Consulting in person I was still Consulting in person and we moved to waiheke island off Auckland and so I was starting commuting and I was I've got a job again I've got a flipping job again right and because it was single source of income have to get up have to go to a place have to stay there have to come back and hop on a boat to get to Auckland boat yeah wait if anyone who doesn't know waiheke island is not connected via a bridge it's a 45 year 35 yes 35 minute Theory and it's a beautiful Lifestyle on there but then to have to go to the CBD or wherever you're going every day that was yeah it drained me real quick yeah and after having all those ideas sitting in my head and then that sub track playing in the background through podcasts and things of freedom and location Independence and digital nomadism I needed to do my own thing and so through Sam's course I launched my first product e-commerce engine and then we did a million and it was about 13 months yeah well yeah talk about timing as well unfair advantages back in the day when you could get leads for a dollar on Facebook and course 50 bucks yeah yeah but just got on the phone first price point was 2500 yeah then put it up to 6 Grand later so walk me through that process so you've got all this expertise you've built in person he tells you how to package it into a course or are you coaching one-to-one what does that look yeah the classic course with calls model that I call it now I had a Google drive folder with six modules in it and an introduction yeah a free Facebook group no sorry a Facebook group which is obviously free but paid for for clients yeah and then then a weekly call with what was it called on go to webinar oh goodness yeah 400 bucks a month at the time man yeah that's crazy yeah we don't know how good I'm done now it was great yeah and e-commerce them was really fragmented so it's pre-shopify so it was really people had all these different it wasn't pre-shopify but it was early it wasn't a big thing it is now the de facto solution for Ecom yeah so all these people had all these different platforms and the tech stuff was a bit of a nightmare yeah so to give them email templates and card abandoned sequences and conversion and Facebook ad templates it was a brand new thing at the time to that to that market it was what you give me stuff that works out of the box and I just go and copy and paste it and you help me modify it and I use it and it makes money yeah cool and so that was the most natural people for you to work with I guess having got come from grab one and Groupon yeah was you're now just in that e-commerce space you're not a coach helping coaches get clients it's you have an e-commerce store it's I've seen three billion dollars of e-commerce transactions flow past my herbals yeah so I was I know how to make people buy stuff online yeah so what was that learning curve going online the biggest learning curve was just the deployment of it because I thought I had to know all the tech and all those things the click funnels templates and that stuff yeah so that's all the stuff that that tripped me up sorry guys quick technical difficulty I had a camera that overheated we are back in the game so we're talking about you coaching online e-commerce and talking about the learning curve and so the biggest challenge for you at that time was the deployment they're getting the stuff done yeah going through all the steps yeah well it's the the stuff that you think you need that you don't really

all those things the click funnels templates and that stuff yeah so that's all the stuff that that tripped me up sorry guys quick technical difficulty I had a camera that overheated we are back in the game so we're talking about you coaching online e-commerce and talking about the learning curve and so the biggest challenge for you at that time was the deployment they're getting the stuff done yeah going through all the steps yeah well it's the the stuff that you think you need that you don't really yeah and the the first iteration of that course was I've got to get this done screw it so that's why I use Google drive right and a Facebook group and that because I was sick of passing around and procrastinating on myself going I need to host it in an online thing yeah and it's the same thing now with I need all this stuff to be to make it look a certain way yeah so I was much more worried about what people thought about it then it was it something that you were getting from Sam as well at the time meaning you bought into a program that was awesome on Dropbox because I'm sure at that time there were some people that just changed it so I didn't I wasn't I was on the cusp of there was still stuff stored there yeah and I think the first iteration was just a tree of files and then there was the kajabi stuff and videos and again it was building it as we were going through it yeah the first version up level well I think one of the the best I don't know if you said this out loud or if this was just something I took from Consulting accelerator but when I started in 2018 yeah I had skills that I could transfer to marketing but I had no marketing experience per se I had no ads experience no funnels and so I was really good at sales so I was getting people to say yes and then going all right now I need to figure out how to do this and I'll never forget just the belief I got from going through this program was I need to believe my ability to figure it out so I never forget hiring a a getting a client and I was doing something around his content and then he hired me to do his Facebook ads and my confidence came from the fact that Sam had all the modules on Facebook ads in there even though I hadn't gone through them and never run a Facebook ad so I run this client's card and he's yeah man really need these ads to work and I'm they're gonna to be amazing right and then I go through all of Sam's stuff and then overnight and then at 5am I launched the client's ads and then the next morning I wake up however many hours are later and he's got all of these webinar registrations and his crushing but for me it was that delusion that even though I didn't have the expertise I could borrow it from someone else and also I just I needed to believe my ability to figure it out and I think that's a belief that served me so much I don't know if there was anything around that time that that carried you through belief-wise can you remember what your self-taught was in that time because you were going from in person to online you're running ads people were now probably talking crap on your ads and you're now an expert selling a product what was that self-talk that was a complete Paradox because I was the big deal I was a marketing director of the fastest growing company in the country so it was a paradox of the small Fray internet little tiny stuff was who cares right what's the big deal but the ego was the thing that was preventing me from doing the stuff I needed to do because it didn't look right right so both of those opposing forces got me stuck right in terms of not launching it fast enough not hitting the ground running because when I did it was it was off straight away so there was a paradox of I'm really good look at this this stuff's little it's so easy I

paradox of the small Fray internet little tiny stuff was who cares right what's the big deal but the ego was the thing that was preventing me from doing the stuff I needed to do because it didn't look right right so both of those opposing forces got me stuck right in terms of not launching it fast enough not hitting the ground running because when I did it was it was off straight away so there was a paradox of I'm really good look at this this stuff's little it's so easy I could phone it in yeah but also I needed it to look a certain way because I was worried people went away you've got a reputation you've got yeah yeah I get it so it was the worst Paradox you can get because the two opposing forces of the equal you're just stuck in place yeah and I was for months stuck in place doing what were you were you doing the equivalent of I'm building a website for myself I was doing the equivalent of I'm gonna move these boxes around on this landing page and make and do the slides for that vsl video again yeah yeah and by Friday it will be done oh no I should change that word right perfectionist procrastination yeah because I was worried about what people would think about it which I think is human nature I think there'd be a lot of people listening who laugh at something that and go I remember those days or that's so funny but most of my coaching calls are dealing with people even at multiples and figures who were just overthinking stuff they're they're in they're in a that a loop of productive procrastination I'm not not this is one of the things I've learned about entrepreneurs normal people when they're overwhelmed or unclear right normally right they they don't do anything right so that's why when you talk to normal people the everyday person around procrastination it's such a huge topic because they're struggling with inaction most entrepreneurs struggle with too much action they're taking so much action in so many different directions that it's the thing causing them to not move forward because they're productively procrastinating right so instead of me creating the module I'm going to listen to 10 podcasts and five of the best YouTube videos on it and read three books on it so that I create the perfect podcast of the perfect module or the whatever it may be yeah and that version of what you went through I'm trying to get the landing page perfect is the same thing that everyone goes through it just looks different it looks more mature that it's the same behavior in that same whether it's scarcity or insecurity or inadequacy driving people for I'm just waiting for it to be perfect right that's it's a perfectionism that people wrestle fully I think also that there's also as you grow up there's a there's a creation of optionality get this thing so you can get that thing get the get the qualification so you can get the job so if you create options for yourself if you create more options yourself for yourself it's better the reality is very different the more options just lead you to more more noise in the system to say what's the actual signal and because it's the hardest question to answer what do I want right so that you get more options to get things that other people want that you think you should want so then you just get stuck because you're dealing with your own internal procrastination but you're also looking at the wants of others and going maybe I should want that maybe what I want isn't good enough yeah I totally agree and I think that's the whole idea of people are suffering from the the silent disease of of confusion or lack of clarity is so true yeah right most people just do not know what they want or if or if they know what they want they don't know why they want it oh you want to get to 50K a month why sounds great 100 camera I would love to shake Russell brunson's hand but they don't have a vision that's fueled by a motivation that will

I totally agree and I think that's the whole idea of people are suffering from the the silent disease of of confusion or lack of clarity is so true yeah right most people just do not know what they want or if or if they know what they want they don't know why they want it oh you want to get to 50K a month why sounds great 100 camera I would love to shake Russell brunson's hand but they don't have a vision that's fueled by a motivation that will push them through and so they're just stuck in cycles of I think the part at the end of the rainbow is going to be awesome and it's going to be a 50k a month and then you get there and it's not there yeah people don't typically have a Clear Vision with a clear motivation that's going to push them through the different seasons yeah I also I also see that there's also the other sea there's a lack of consequence right yeah yeah there's we we love Clarity but we also act on consequence and an example would be in our friends group at the moment lots of parents in their 40s and a couple of people have died of heart attacks right right and their 40s too early too young and it has prompted lots of people to look at their genetic line get tested heart health diet all those things but until then everyone was carrying on eating the fried food and doing the doing all the things because there was there's no obvious consequence to the behavior and people go oh you want to live long time for your kids and they they sound nice in a theory in a theoretical way but when it comes to it fried chips taste nice and and beer is good sometimes but I think it's also consequence there's very in Comfort there's very little consequence yeah there's very little consequence to not doing the thing yeah and this is why I see so many entrepreneurs driven by the darkness driven by that dark thing of I've got to prove my dad wrong yeah I was born when I was young that teacher who said that I was never going to amount to anything and when I was 14 that the seeds of that are there yeah and the consequence of not doing it is more internal pain yeah and the the benefit of doing it is a some misaligned view that that will provide relief from that pain yeah and so I think consequence motivates most action and you don't need to be clear about something to do it yeah because Clarity is a fiction how when covert everyone was wow well this is really we didn't see this coming and it's we never see the future coming yeah it's a ludicrous analogy because it's we didn't see the future coming before covert and we don't see the future coming during it and after yeah in these ideas you can't even say covert you've got to get it out the thing the thing that happened in 2020 but that there was there's this idea that Clarity needs to be present before we take action there's an idea that belief needs to be present to take action and I was sharing with clients recently of I need so little evidence now to believe in something we call it Instinct and we call these accumulated wisdom and all this stuff but I see something working once and I'm I'm gonna do a lot more of this yeah yeah and I think as you go along you you don't need as much belief because you you can pattern match some things and go well this is this so I'm going to do more of it right and you don't need belief and Clarity to do it but you need some consequence to make you move otherwise you ain't doing it isn't that fascinating thing about the amount of convincing you need to start a business versus the amount of convincing you need to launch a new offer right people can convince themselves in a heartbeat to go I need to launch a new tripwire a new funnel whatever but to get over that hump of belief around I have something to to give of value is this huge

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 7

- ```txt ## Crafting a Compelling Offer **Summary:** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Welcome! Today, we'll focus on constructing your daily client machine—how to generate leads hourly, customers daily, and clients weekly. It's critical to attack things in the right order: offer, then sales, then marketing. The best way to hit a goal is to work backward from it. Create and validate an offer, make three sales with a Google Doc, create a customer offer that converts 5% of buyers into clients, and then automate lead flow, customer offers, and ascend customers into clients weekly. This system creates leads and customers, engages with customers to understand their intent, and captures those who don't display immediate intent for future conversion. The two key components are your big idea and your customer offer. The process is: lead magnet (capture and opt-in), customer offer ($100 digital product), and client offer. The big idea is a product of your client and customer offers, a frame that catches attention, creates curiosity, and establishes authority. ## Big Ideas and Customer Offers **Summary:** This chunk explores different frames for creating a big idea, including swiping, next steps, automation, and identity. It also discusses the customer offer and its role in converting leads. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Many big ideas become so successful they become the brand. Consider these frames: swiping (copy my success), next steps (your first client), automation (automatic clients), and identity (the sovereign consultant). Big ideas often have utility across multiple products (books, courses, consulting). My big idea, "selling from a Google Doc," led to a daily client machine that generates 5-10 leads daily and 1-2 product sales, doubling with simple ads. Put your big idea everywhere—social media profiles, ads. The customer offer turns leads into customers. Ideal components include training, templates, a live workshop, and a call. ## Offer Creation and Validation **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer creation, validation through market feedback, and the key principles of promise, process, and plan. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The path to a million-dollar business is simple, not easy: promise, process, mechanisms, plan, validation, sales, scale, automation. The hybrid offer is key, a single offer with multiple products. Four reasons people buy help: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Focus on one core reason; everything else is a benefit. Understand the problem/desire you're solving. Validation is getting your offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. Use the community for feedback based on real data. ## Hybrid Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk explains the hybrid offer, its advantages over traditional consulting, and provides specific pricing recommendations for community offers, consulting offers, and customer offers. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer, containing multiple products. It includes a 12-month ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Pricing examples: Community offers ($100-200/week, $3,000 annual), consulting offers ($300-600/week), customer offers ($100). This pricing maximizes conversions and economics, making it easy to get started and upgrade. ## Offer Construction Principles **Summary:** This chunk details the three core principles of offer construction: promise, process, and plan. It stresses the importance of clarity, future pacing, and avoiding information overload. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** Three principles: promise (what gets done), process (how it works), plan (how it rolls out)

> "Support to install a system attracting 5 prospects monthly, securing 1 high-value client monthly, on your terms, without being the best-kept secret."
 Example plan: 
> "In the first 6 weeks, we'll install the client roadmap, product roadmap, and IP generator system."
 Modalities: Coaching (discovering answers), consulting (giving answers), mentorship (showing how). I create for my community, coach on weekly calls, consult on WhatsApp, mentor on Zoom. You can sell modalities individually or bundled into products. ## Access to Training and Classroom Content **Summary:** This chunk addresses the value of accessing all trainings and recordings within a community membership. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We've added a valuable benefit: access to all my trainings and templates. Many people want a back catalog of resources. As a community member, you get access to every recording and training. This is a key benefit of joining. ## Offer Specificity and Niche Targeting **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer specificity, avoiding trying to be everything to everyone, and targeting a specific niche. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Are you clear about your core offer? Have you defined your content, community, and customization? Have you scoped out your promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI? The weakest offers try to be everything to everyone. A clear promise is essential. Have you laid out a plan with unique mechanisms? People buy new things that solve old problems. ## Outreach Templates and Offer Sharpening **Summary:** This chunk discusses providing outreach templates and the importance of sharpening existing offers for better conversion. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** I'll be providing templates for outreach, including social posts and emails. We'll cover these in detail next week. For now, focus on your offer. Are you working on a new offer or modifying an existing one? Let's sharpen your offer for better results. ## Niche Selection and Offer Clarity **Summary:** This chunk uses a real-world example to illustrate how to refine a niche and create a compelling offer promise. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Ramzi's example of e-commerce sellers wanting to step out of their business) A niche defines the desire in the marketplace. It's a good hypothesis, but not specific enough. What will the outcome look for them? Time freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things because they're terrifying. Pre-package a vision for them. 
> "Helping e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week"
 is more specific. 
> "I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week"

> "Helping e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week"
 is more specific. 
> "I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week"
 is even better. ## Binary Offers and Commitment **Summary:** This chunk explains the power of binary offers (yes/no) and how they attract the most committed clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** The best offers are binary (yes/no). Maybes make people broke and frustrated. The best offers get people to say yes or no, with a subset of "no" being "not now." Most people will say no to the best offers, but those who say yes are the most committed. Manufacture a binary that allows the right people to say yes. ## Structuring Offers for Choice and Specificity **Summary:** This chunk discusses offering structure, the importance of providing a sense of choice while maintaining specificity, and addressing perceived barriers to entry. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** People want structure and choice. "One day a week" implies they can work two days if they want. Don't be afraid of specificity. The best offers come down to a binary. When creating an offer, you're making an offer most people will say no to. The best offers are specific and polarizing, excluding the majority of the audience. ## Quantifying Offer Promises **Summary:** This chunk uses another real-world example to demonstrate how to quantify offer promises for greater clarity and impact. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Richelle's example of helping business owners with asset-driven businesses) Quantify your promises. "440 subscribers in 30 days" is sexy to the right person. Focus on helping people get their first 500 or next 500 email subscribers. Are they sold on email as the mechanism? Quantify the results of their conversion event (workshop, etc.). 
> "If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one client every time they run it"

> "If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one client every time they run it"
 is a strong promise. ## Overcoming the Curse of Competence and Building Belief **Summary:** This chunk addresses the curse of competence, how it hinders offer creation, and the shift towards building belief in the client's ability to achieve the promised result. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** The curse of competence prevents people from making specific offers. Small promises are easy to keep. Shift your messaging towards building belief in the client's ability to achieve the result. Transmit belief in them. Focus on "I can do it," not just "Look how great I am." ## Visualizing the Offer and Manufacturing Desire **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of using vivid language to help prospects visualize the desired outcome and create a strong desire for the offer. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Good copy helps prospects visualize the outcome. Use concrete examples they can relate to (Stripe notifications, calendar appointments). Allow them to abstract an experience they haven't had yet. "Waking up to notifications" and "calendar with appointments booked" are more powerful than vague promises. This is why people follow influencers—they want to imagine themselves living that life. ## Marketplace Offers and Founding Members **Summary:** This chunk discusses creating a marketplace offer, attracting founding members, and the importance of validating the offer hypothesis. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Alphonso's example of building a marketplace for email deliverability clients) A community is a low-friction network. You're building a network of people selling to other people. The first sale is to yourself. Have an offer hypothesis people can buy into. The ultimate arbitrator of an offer is the marketplace. ## Offer Polarization and Effortless Selling **Summary:** This chunk explains how polarizing offers, designed to be rejected by most, attract the most committed clients and lead to effortless selling. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Construct offers most people will say no to. Look for polarization. This excludes the majority but attracts the most committed. There's no salesmanship, no pricing resistance, no convincing. ## Iterating on Offers Based on Market Feedback **Summary:** This chunk discusses using market feedback (ghosting, objections) to iterate on offers and make them more compelling. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Richelle's question about offering multiple tiers and handling rejections) If you have data on why people said no, use it to improve the offer. "Too expensive" means they didn't see the value. "No ROI" means you need to demonstrate the return. If they ghosted, be more specific. ## Community Offers and Ongoing Support **Summary:** This chunk explores the strategic use of community offers for ongoing support and recurring revenue, using a conflict resolution example. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Steve's example of conflict resolution services) Position the community as ongoing support after an intensive engagement. This drives recurring revenue and keeps clients in your world. Don't call it a "community" at the offer level; call it an "ongoing support package." ## Overcoming Perceived Barriers in Offer Creation **Summary:** This chunk addresses perceived barriers that prevent prospects from taking action and how to incorporate these into the offer to facilitate conversion. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Rebecca's example of helping people transition to tiny houses) Address the small inhibitors and blocks that prevent people from taking action. Bring those things into the "now." Remove the perceived barriers. Example: 
> "Step one is showing you what you need to get for your house to put it on sale, get a finance plan, and get your first plans in place."

> "Step one is showing you what you need to get for your house to put it on sale, get a finance plan, and get your first plans in place."
 Offer a small paid product to address these initial barriers. ## Offer Benefits and Core Focus **Summary:** This chunk discusses the role of benefits in an offer, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a core focus while acknowledging the various benefits. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** (Adam's question about including multiple benefits) Include all relevant benefits, but lead with the core offer. The driver of a desired outcome (e.g., better productivity) comes from a single source. Define that single source. Tier 2 is typically faster access, more intimacy, and more perceived care. ## Paid in Full Options and Offer Presentation **Summary:** This chunk discusses the strategic use of paid-in-full options, when to mention them in the offer, and the importance of the core promise. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Mention the paid-in-full option in the offer document if you're bundling a bonus. If you're offering a large discount against weeklies, mention it in the cart. The $100/week promise is often strong enough; the core promise does the rest. ## Offer Specificity and Communication Impact **Summary:** This chunk highlights the importance of offer specificity, its impact on overall communication, and the benefits of training oneself to be specific. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Focus on specificity in your offers. Get the "pointing finger" out. Can you imagine the promise? Specificity in offers carries over into all communication, improving engagement. It provides footholds for your audience. ``` ============================================================ # SOURCE FILE: all_transcripts_combined_part_4.txt

- ```txt ## The Power of One: Building a $1M/Year Business with a Single Offer **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the simplicity of building a million-dollar online business using a single, well-crafted offer within the knowledge economy. He outlines the path, highlighting the importance of a tight, specific, and minimal offer-driven model. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The path is simple, though not easy: make a promise, define a process with unique mechanisms, create a plan, present the offer, and validate it with sales. This model allows for dynamic, fast iteration using tools Google Docs. Results happen in the marketplace, not from consuming ideas, so creating and testing offers is key. Validation means getting the offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. ## Fast and Stable Growth: Balancing Constraints and Flexibility **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of stability for rapid growth, advocating for a balance between constraints and flexibility. He emphasizes the need for underlying principles and frames to navigate uncertainty and ensure results happen *for* you, not *to* you. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The most powerful systems are both fast and stable. To move fast, you need a mix of constraints and flexibility. While certainty is unattainable, having the right frameworks and principles allows you to capitalize on opportunities and solve underlying problems. The initial setup involves defining who you are, what you do, and your target audience. ## Market Selection and Sociological Branding: Prioritizing Your Energy **Summary:** Kemp explains the importance of market selection, advising to be close to money for greater financial success. He contrasts sociological branding (prioritizing your energy and desires) with psychological branding (catering to market demands). Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Your market choice significantly impacts your financial results. Being close to money—its creation, discovery, keeping, and transfer—increases earning potential. However, market selection should align with your desires, skills, and market permission. A sociological business prioritizes your energy and interests, attracting -minded individuals through natural polarization. This contrasts with psychological businesses that chase market demands, often becoming chameleons. ## Building Your Brand: Mechanism, Identity, and Transparency **Summary:** Kemp highlights the importance of a unique mechanism, a clear identity, targeted content, and transparency in building a compelling brand. He advises actively repelling those who aren't your ideal clients and focusing on total, honest communication. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Key elements for a successful brand include a unique mechanism, a defined client identity, content showcasing your past, present, and future, and clear messaging that repels those you don't serve. Transparency is crucial in a low-trust environment. Total, honest communication trumps polished copywriting; authenticity attracts the right people. ## Client Value and Power Laws: Maximizing Revenue and Retention **Summary:** Kemp introduces the concept of power laws in client relationships, emphasizing that not all clients are equal. He advocates for focusing on annualized client value and creating an ecosystem that allows clients to find their natural spending level. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Power laws dictate that a small percentage of clients contribute a large percentage of income. Ignoring this leads to diminishing returns and burnout. Focus on annualized client value and create an ecosystem with revenue buckets. This allows clients to naturally ascend to higher value tiers based on their needs and desires for access and speed. ## Cash Velocity and Revenue Volatility: Smoothing the Path to Growth **Summary:** Kemp stresses the importance of lowering revenue volatility to reduce emotional stress and improve business performance. He recommends reverse engineering from your financial goals and incorporating one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan

. This allows clients to naturally ascend to higher value tiers based on their needs and desires for access and speed. ## Cash Velocity and Revenue Volatility: Smoothing the Path to Growth **Summary:** Kemp stresses the importance of lowering revenue volatility to reduce emotional stress and improve business performance. He recommends reverse engineering from your financial goals and incorporating one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Recurring revenue businesses are robust, but recurring revenue doesn't always arrive as expected. Lowering revenue volatility reduces emotional stress and improves operational efficiency. Reverse engineer from your financial goals and use one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue. This allows for a sustainable pace and smoother growth. ## Offer Creation and Validation: The Hybrid Offer and Client Feedback **Summary:** Kemp explains the hybrid offer model, which involves a single offer with multiple products at varying price points and durations. He emphasizes the importance of a clear promise, process, and plan, and using client feedback to refine the offer. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer. Focus on a clear promise, process, and plan, allowing prospects to envision their future. Prioritize clarity over complexity; many offers fail due to being indigestible. Validate your offer by getting it in front of 10 people and aiming for 3 sales. Use feedback, especially from those who say "no," to refine your offer. In early stages, a "no" is valuable data. ## Leveraging Existing Assets and Networks for Offer Validation **Summary:** Kemp encourages leveraging existing networks and assets for initial offer validation, emphasizing that an audience and a network are the same in the early stages. He advises testing the offer with a simple message and listening intently to prospect feedback. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** For offer validation, leverage your existing network: past clients, email lists, social media connections, current leads, partners, and personal contacts. Test your offer with a simple message, focusing on the promise and making it easy to get started. This is a listening exercise; gather data on how people respond. "Ghosting" often indicates a lack of clarity in the offer. ## Refining Your Offer: Clarity, Brevity, and Context through Content **Summary:** Kemp advises focusing offers on the client's transformation, not your own story. He stresses the importance of brevity and clarity, using content to provide context and pre-sell the process and mechanisms. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** Offers should focus on the client's transformation, not your past achievements. Brevity and clarity are key; the offer is a bridge to their future state. Use content to build context and pre-sell the process and mechanisms. By the time they reach the offer, they should already believe you can solve their problem. Focus on the promise and what happens *to them*. ## Creating Compelling Offers: Empathy, Tangibility, and Relief **Summary:** Kemp emphasizes empathy in understanding client desires, highlighting the importance of selling an experience and articulating a tangible, better tomorrow. He advises focusing on selling relief and making the offer a bridge to that relief. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** Empathy is crucial for understanding client desires. Sell an experience, not just features. Make the offer tangible by describing the physical experience of the desired outcome or the removal of the problem. Focus on selling relief—a better tomorrow—and make the offer a clear path to that relief. Tangibility and a clear vision make offers easy to sell. ## Offer Distinction and Positioning: Standing Out in Competitive Markets **Summary:** Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 16

values that's why we that's why we look at when people get caught doing things that are underhanded who have a a high moral standing in society we have that look yeah because if you undermine certain values then you can never be trusted again it's funny because again it comes back to that idea of we give people credibility where they haven't earned it based on status yeah this is funny in crypto right it's people were surprised that crypto rug pulls happen yeah and it's you trusted this person because they had a hundred thousand followers on Twitter and had been tweeting for six months about this Amazing Project they're going to have or maybe they had a personal brand as a successful Trader they launch something and then all of a sudden they they rug you lose money they make money and you're wait a minute I thought you were supposed to be this person but they'd not necessarily ever shown themselves be a person who was had Integrity in this area it was just that they were successful and we made that synonymous with trustworthy whereas if you've been I was asked yesterday how how many posts have you put on Facebook do you think it's man maybe it averages out at one a day for five years not including stories not including any other platform it's it's a thousand plus and I consistently have people who come into my world and in short term and short times I become clients but the more common theme I see is I've been following you for years so I remember when you finish being a youth pastor or the compounding effect of the audience and the way that people trust you over time is just so invaluable and I think it's an interesting thing to observe because some coaches and Consultants are caught with their pants down going but I thought I could just run a five-day challenge I didn't want to really share my life online and and I think it's it's an interesting place because I'm really enjoying the journey but many people aren't many people are going I just want to run the ads and have the webinar funnel and I didn't sign up to be anyone's Guru and it's well you're a coach it did yeah if you're asking for thousands of dollars from someone they need to know they can trust you you can't just give them to a closer and a really awesome 45-minute sales pitch gets them in they want to know who they're doing business with and there's so many different choices why should they choose you yeah why should they work with you and that's why vlogging and podcasts and and just content in general I think is so powerful when it comes to building audience because it it's easy to pretend for a video and it's really hard to keep the act up over weeks and months and years and dozens and dozens of pieces of content yeah there is there is a barrier even to the way that you've used the word audience there and I'll pick up on this there is a barrier to people getting started with the belief that audience equals mass right right that audience equals a large amount of attention if you take if you go back on my journey my first client I had an audience of one they became a client yeah because of what factor trust right so in the internet world where we're looking at vanity metrics views and likes and things that are on mass we over index on the size of attention we think we need and we under index on trust and that's that's what's happening in the rebalancing now towards the Creator economy and the personal brand and these things because we're trying to rebalance trust that you can grow a really big business an impactful one off a tiny tiny audience if you have the highest levels of trust in the audience so something that stops people is this idea that you need a big audience right because you only need an audience of one person in a relevant way who trusts you to do anything yeah but and the more they trust you the more intimacy that's already been achieved so the more :03 implicitly you understand how you're useful to them on on the journey you go on so I

that you can grow a really big business an impactful one off a tiny tiny audience if you have the highest levels of trust in the audience so something that stops people is this idea that you need a big audience right because you only need an audience of one person in a relevant way who trusts you to do anything yeah but and the more they trust you the more intimacy that's already been achieved so the more :03 implicitly you understand how you're useful to them on on the journey you go on so I think the idea of audience stops :09 a lot of people just as much as it helps people because but we we go to audience and we look at the :16 mass Market yeah yeah everybody is in the media business now to some extent everybody's streaming this and :23 reeling that and tick-tocking this I'll make myself an augment :28 because we've got an audience of something and it always makes me laugh how :34 much traction people can get with tiny little audiences who trust them yeah what's that belief that I don't have an :39 audience or a list and you're do humans :47 and if if they aren't the right person they probably know the right person right it's all concentric circles yeah :53 it's all concentric circles out but we look at it as one big giant one as an audience and that dehumanizes everything :00 in it which just goes back to the point we're talking about before everybody's lost the humanity and marketing right :05 because it used to be person to person and then it went media printed media physical media and then it went :12 digital so we talk about an audience and we forget there's humans inside and it's Madness well we think about a :18 market a niche yeah they're all created equal there's this just a hundred faces all lined up :25 and they all look the same yeah and I just need to sell to five of them because they're my audience they're :30 humans right yeah and the humanity go has gone out of marketing and and persuasion and these things because :37 everybody forgets there's a human on the other side of the action that you're taking and the message you were taking and that that concept has served me so :44 well in writing and creating for things and it's the the interaction that :50 you get on and we've talked about this before the vanity metrics that you get on stuff that moves the needle :57 builds a relationship makes money in in those pieces as often there's an inverse correlation :03 you do the posts with 150 likes on your Facebook feed and it does nothing it :10 doesn't impact anybody because everybody just piles on to say good job yeah but you do the one that got four likes :17 and someone messages you and said oh my God that thing that you said there you really cut through to me and you got a a :24 person at a certain place at a time you touched a human but we've :30 become obsessed with the mass we've become obsessed with needing this audience thing when reality is everybody :36 has one yeah it's not about and I think a better way to even reframe it is you don't need an auditory connection :41 with people and that that group of better if we just got rid of the word yeah guys would have eliminated it now :48 we've got rid of it beep it out but I read the other day and it summarized thoughts I'd had for a long :54 time which is if you want to create a deep connection with the audience go narrow if you want to create a big :59 audience go wide and I think one of the things that's really fascinating to me is how much money I've made that :05 you've made from relatively small audiences we have friends who are I've got clients who are influencers yeah they have a hundred :12 times the amount of followers that I have and make a fraction of the money because they've gone wide and have a big audience

is if you want to create a deep connection with the audience go narrow if you want to create a big :59 audience go wide and I think one of the things that's really fascinating to me is how much money I've made that :05 you've made from relatively small audiences we have friends who are I've got clients who are influencers yeah they have a hundred :12 times the amount of followers that I have and make a fraction of the money because they've gone wide and have a big audience but they don't have a deep :18 connection with the audience they have and that's where I think that's so encouraging to me because for anyone who :24 is looking to get started or restarted or has lost momentum it comes back to the one how can I write to help the :32 one person how can I shoot a video with one person in mind and when I am my :37 YouTube videos now are averaging 400 500 views my first YouTube video :43 that I posted a few months ago got 18 views and I remember picturing 18 people and a coffee shop and I was going :50 that's a lot of people if I was to be talking and they would have been listening and it's funny how numbers again :57 take the humanity away because we often over inflate the importance of big :04 numbers and we underestimate the power of the the small audience that are intently leaning in if you have an :11 audience of 100 people who know and trust you you can make really good money :16 right Kevin Kelly Kevin Kelly thousand true fans yeah it's such a powerful it's a hundred two thousand thousand thousand :23 thousand but his whole thing was if you are passionate about a band or if :28 you're selling T-shirts or if you've got a thousand true fans and so it's just fascinating to me :33 that this isn't this is a conversation I think many people haven't had with themselves which is ultimately :39 why am I doing this because I was sold this dream of I run an ad I have a :45 webinar I have this coaching business and I'm living this laptop lifestyle and they've lost the why :50 and if you lose the service element of you create content for an audience :56 to help people right a byproduct of that help is trust and a byproduct of trust :01 is purchase but if you don't keep the service part piece a part of it all you have is this funnel and metrics :09 and you struggle to gain traction yeah you're running funnels to generate numbers to look at kpis to :14 optimize click-through rates and then you wonder why you're struggling to create a sense of connection yeah and it's that game of guess who you're :20 does your person have glasses you're knocking them down it's niches work the same way it's well I'm looking for chiropractors on the :25 Internet it's well let's just get personal what types of chiropractors who are they do anyone what do they important yeah what :32 do they want what do they need what's the thing that keeps them up at night all of that stuff yeah one of the things I wanted to talk about was :38 authenticity yeah I think that's probably the thing I've observed in both of us is the the more comfortable with :45 being in our own skin the better businesses we've created because we are not creating from a place :50 of insecurity and scarcity I want to be someone on the internet I want to look a certain way and it's been a sense of :56 I know for me the physical the physical sensation I think of is just :02 just a sense of comfort yeah in my skin what is that Journey been for you over the last couple of years :09 and was that very difficult was there a moment where you're throwing in the towel on the mimicry and you're :14 going I'm not going all in on James what has that been no the only the only

internet I want to look a certain way and it's been a sense of :56 I know for me the physical the physical sensation I think of is just :02 just a sense of comfort yeah in my skin what is that Journey been for you over the last couple of years :09 and was that very difficult was there a moment where you're throwing in the towel on the mimicry and you're :14 going I'm not going all in on James what has that been no the only the only lightning strike :20 moment was when I realized I needed to go online when I was standing in the rain waiting for another Fairy that's the only that only was :28 screw it I've got to do something but everything else has been very Progressive I think two major events were moving to Bali because this place :36 what does it do to you I think it it puts you out in an environment that you're not used to and and is very much :44 it's not it's it's not eat what you kill but it's very much you you realize you're outside of an of the :49 normal systems that you normally depend on and then separating from my wife last year which was :55 oh I have to find myself :00 after being with someone for 25 years which is who am I because you think :06 yourself but when you're in an intimate relationship you both have shared beliefs but you also :12 have beliefs that you need to believe for each other you compromise and and then there's trade-offs so that those :18 two things have have been the biggest catalysts along that journey of finding :23 who I really am because again for in the last nine months it's been around doing :29 the things I had to do and and we you talk about authenticity as well it's the last nine months have been the :35 most brutal emotionally but also financially that I've had to endure for :40 almost a decade for obvious reasons :46 but I've never felt more certain :51 of who I am and enabling me to operate in that because :58 I had to I have to people depend on me so I think :05 when you get when the when it gets real you have to be authentic to yourself :13 otherwise you don't this is the choice that you've made right when it gets real you don't have to :19 be authentic to yourself there's so many different parts you could have taken this year so why yeah we've talked this one :25 what was it about this year that you were big so sorry to interrupt no :31 guys so business is moving in a great direction for you now yeah but you could have just as easily gone I'm just :37 gonna focus on being a dad and not that you're not doing that yeah but you're also taking leaps and strides and :42 your health and things that it's definitely something that you using to make yourself better but not everyone :49 makes that choice no and that's a brutally hard choice because it's much easier to :57 what has caused you to approach it the way that you have this year I don't feel I have any choice and :04 that's what keeps me going and even hearing people say what a good job I'm doing and all those things and I get lots of Praise from lots of people makes :09 me uncomfortable so I'm still working on the being being grateful for who I am and :15 what I do and that and that receiving book because I feel uncomfortable now just from you going :20 you could have done this another way and it could be much worse and it could be objectively :26 so your faint praise is is always welcome but discomforting :31 I I reconfirm stuff that I guess I knew I love being a dad :37 but I didn't know that I knew that right because my ex-wife and I had :44 different ideas of children and what what they'd what what impact they'd had on our lives and those things :50

uncomfortable now just from you going :20 you could have done this another way and it could be much worse and it could be objectively :26 so your faint praise is is always welcome but discomforting :31 I I reconfirm stuff that I guess I knew I love being a dad :37 but I didn't know that I knew that right because my ex-wife and I had :44 different ideas of children and what what they'd what what impact they'd had on our lives and those things :50 and I'm no I love being a dad might love having a loving :55 relationship so it was it was those things of those moments of clarity I also think :00 it's easier I'm 43 I think it's easier as :06 you get older because you just you've done more stuff and you get more of a sense of you've done and tried more :11 stuff so you get more of a sense of the the decisions you make but if because if you listen to yourself you you've got :16 enough instinct to know which which which where's your North Star and where to go so it's been brutally :24 difficult in the practice of doing the things I've done in the last year :30 but it hasn't been difficult getting myself to do them if that makes sense it does make sense and I think about :37 how different this would look and feel if you were an accountant going through a really hard season yeah because you :42 rock up to work you've got your spreadsheets you've got your co-workers you can head down and you can just :48 almost hide we have a very public life yeah but :54 I did do that and I can afford to do that right I can afford to not work yeah :00 for a period of time right yeah so :05 why do I go back to working and why do I make the decisions I do because I gotta :11 I can't not do it so how did you navigate that that was what I'm trying to get to because :16 there is there is a lot of professions that don't have us out publicly having this conversation it doesn't have us :21 posting content and coaching clients and being asked the hard questions so how did you navigate that almost feeling :27 the plane is Airborne and you're changing both engines at the same time and so James is rocking up to a coaching :33 call and as opposed to previous seasons of Life probably doesn't feel he's got it all together doesn't feel he :39 knows which way is up how did you navigate that and work through that while you're still working on all :45 those things going on in your life I pretended I acted when I needed to that I had my :50

[ __ ] together but in in certain moments you definitely don't feel it I had moments there where I was :03 I remember doing a call with a mutual friend of ours for an hour for an hour and a half in :08 January that I had to do and he could tell that I was not not :14 in a good spot but most other people couldn't but which is the skill of :22 playing a character on the internet so I think I navigated it through a mixture of gretton determination some acting and :29 then giving myself a lot of Grace and and also the sheer fact that I I didn't have to do a lot I had to unwind :36 and unravel a lot of stuff in a business that was starting to show signs of being a business that I thought I :43 wanted I was very leveraged and scaled and it wasn't necessarily dependent on the personal brand and some :48 of the things that I'm back to doing now but I think everything was a choice :53 and there were definitely times where I felt I could curl up and sit in the hole :59 still are but there's there's a bigger picture of play I think the kids :04 and a relationship I'm in now that is got a defined future in terms of :10 something that we're doing and going towards have been the most simple factor of that and then friends :17 you and our friend Chris in terms of keeping me sane in terms of :22 in in you've reminded me many times that everything's a choice you get to choose :28 every day those words sit with me a lot I remember when you said them to me you get to choose every day and :34 I'm I'm lucky that I've built a lot of ways to make choices I guess if you :40 said if I wasn't if I was had a job and I was an accountant and I had to go nine to five :45 in those things I don't know how those people get through it and a lot of mainly men don't :50 yeah get through it at this time of life because it feels catastrophic the end of a long relationship with kids and :56 intertwined and all those things so it's not been easy and it still isn't :03 but I think it it gives you the it gives you the reality check :09 of the lived reality that you're in because I think these days we can live a fantasy land for a long :15 time until the rugs pulled from under us and did you feel that's where you were was it was were you living :22 authentically a year ago two years ago was there any sense of autopilot that you that looking back you're :29 no I wasn't create because I I think about this in terms of business models as well yeah there :34 was certain periods of time where for me and my my business I was just following :40 Alex romozy I was freaking it was Braveheart he was on the horse we were charging four and we were :46 we were warring against scale or whatever and and so I was just blindly just doing stuff and it wasn't :53 until they have these Rock Bottom moments or these I would never forget going to La December 2021 and the :59 best way I could describe it is my body hit low battery mode it was what why and it was through those :05 periods where I it woke me up a bit and so was there any sense that there's things were on autopilot or :11 there was the playing of a character anything that always I want to come back to what you just said because I I was on the inside of that as :18 well so I want to give perspective on your side if I can go for it but :23 the in hindsight yes there was there was just that curse of :29 Competency that allowed everything to just to keep rolling on despite a feeling of disease that :36 permeated large Bits Of My Life that this is this

- ```txt ## Book Funnels: A Powerful Tool for Profit **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the power of book funnels, highlighting their potential for generating significant profit with minimal effort once established, despite initial challenges. He emphasizes the importance of persistence and the interconnectedness of various marketing platforms in driving conversions. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Book funnels are great once they're running. They have a voracious appetite for time and money. I don't have a link for the book club yet. If you want to do it, I've got nothing set up yet to even get it going. But I know what we're doing. I'll set it up today. Gonna have some banging book funnels. I'm either the smartest man in the world or the luckiest man in the world, but all my book funnels have crashed pretty much from the first week. Once you get them going, they just roll. I remember a few weeks ago we had a $1,000 day through the book funnel. It happened to be a weekend, I think, and I remember that feeling of, I just spent 350 bucks and made a thousand bucks, and I did absolutely nothing. And then it's, spend more money. And you're still not spending enough money. So they're a beautiful funnel. I regret turning anything that I've turned off before, so I pay for ads handsomely to make sure that I don't just get bored and give up on this one because it's a beautiful little monster. Everything nowadays is interconnected. I've seen easier and better results through the book funnel over the last few weeks, as I've started creating more content across more platforms and had wider distribution of just simple posts. So nowadays, my rhythm is the daily email and a video. And the video goes everywhere. The interconnected and algorithmic world means that ads are a super powerful thing, and they'll find the people. But the more they know you, you, trust you, and the more the algorithm hooks into what they're consuming, the more it starts to recommend in these places. And I'm seeing people find me on YouTube, buy a book the next day. ## The Interconnected Algorithmic World and Book Funnels **Summary:** James describes how the interconnected nature of online platforms, driven by algorithms, contributes to the effectiveness of book funnels in converting prospects into clients. He shares an example of a recent client who discovered him on YouTube, bought his book, and subsequently joined his program, demonstrating the rapid conversion potential. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** People are responding in an email for the waitlist or application from the syndicate. The chap who joined this morning was exactly that. He discovered me on YouTube. The algorithm, the Meta algorithm, clocked that he'd watched a YouTube video of me. Then the book funnel was put in front of him, and then he buys the book. And then, he's coming through my daily emails to talk about the syndicate and then joining in the course of a few days. So we are in an interconnected and algorithmic world. The book funnel is a very, very high conversion epicenter of that. But once you get all these things around there, then it starts converting. There's different opportunities. Algorithms are almost scary in the way that they find people and put these assets in front of them. And this is the way to ultimately convert customers into clients. Okay, peeps, I'll get those links checked and we'll upload the training and make sure you got the templates as well today. ## Bundling and Unbundling 101: Introduction to the Value Equation **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the concept of bundling and unbundling, explaining how understanding the individual value equations of prospects is crucial for creating multiple offers and increasing sales

. And this is the way to ultimately convert customers into clients. Okay, peeps, I'll get those links checked and we'll upload the training and make sure you got the templates as well today. ## Bundling and Unbundling 101: Introduction to the Value Equation **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the concept of bundling and unbundling, explaining how understanding the individual value equations of prospects is crucial for creating multiple offers and increasing sales. He emphasizes that each prospect perceives value differently based on their current situation and desired rate of return. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Bundling and unbundling 101. Today I'm going to give you the goggles to look at the value creator and the value equation and talk about what you can unpack in your current business to create more sales, because in many cases you are creating more assets than you think you are. And if you're not creating assets, then this is a way to look at your creation as asset creation. If you're a guest, I'm opening up the syndicate today. Have a look, if that's for you. Great, if it's not, that's great, too. This is a 101. I just want to give you today, putting the goggles on to look at the value equation. There's lots of terms thrown around that represent value. When you go to the market, you'll hear different things, and people judge price as a value indicator, but it's just one of the value indicators. So if you ever hear "it's too expensive" or "I can't afford it right now," they are seen as objections. They're representations of the value equation that somebody is undertaking in their head. The interesting thing about the space we're in is that there hasn't been much commentary on the value equation, because every single prospect in your audience has a different value equation. They see value based on their current position. Every single person has a value equation in their head which is relative to the things they're doing right now. So they see value based on what they're doing, how quickly they can see a return on the next thing that they do, the next investment they make, and the volume and the speed of that. So if your offer or your products that you're putting out in the market, if you want people to perceive them as valuable immediately, then you increase the rate of return, which is, they get more faster by working with you. So when we're communicating, when we're putting messaging out into the market, we have content and communication that seeks to align them with the value equation. ## Multiple Offers, Multiple Value Equations: The Math of Bundling and Unbundling **Summary:** James explains how having multiple offers allows businesses to cater to different value equations within the market, exponentially increasing sales. He stresses the importance of achieving this without adding complexity to the business, which can hinder growth and scalability. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:**

etc. You are trying to communicate that there is value in the thing you do. So if you have one offer, you need a large volume of content to align the highest number of people to a singular value equation. Because if you have a singular offer, you have a singular value equation. It has a linear relationship. Within the syndicate, I show you how to get to a million-dollar-a-year profit business. The value equation of that is going to differ if someone is making $10,000 a year right now versus someone who's making $900,000, because the gap is larger and the perceived time on return is very, very different. So if you have multiple products and offers, then you tip the value equation towards you exponentially. So rather than having a singular offer, if we have multiple offers, then we can have multiple value equations in the marketplace. And by maths, we increase the number of sales we make. So this is the central idea of bundling and unbundling. The more offers we make, the more sales we make. But the subtext is, the more offers we make, the more that we hit the value equation for a larger group of people in the market, because they all perceive what they want, need, and will get in different ways. The key is to do this without adding complexity, and that is honestly where most people fall over. They add complexity to it because they try and meet the market where they perceive the market is, rather than bundling and unbundling and repackaging things to change the value equation. Bundling and unbundling is a way to increase the number of offers we make and increase the value equation in the market without adding complexity. ## Leverage and Assets: Building a Business That Feeds Your Life **Summary:** James emphasizes the importance of leverage in building a sustainable business, advocating for viewing all creations as assets. He differentiates between a product (a vehicle for delivering value) and an offer (products presented to the market with a promise), highlighting how multiple offers maximize economics and leverage. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** The central concept of anything we do is we build businesses that feed our life. This means that leverage is our highest priority. To get the most amount of leverage, it's useful to see everything we create as an asset. If you want to get rich, you either build, borrow, buy, or steal assets and own them and derive a yield from them. The wonderful thing about the space that we live in is that we can create assets very, very quickly, with little to no overhead, just using the things that reside inside our brain. I make this distinction a lot: the distinction between a product and offer. A product is just a vehicle for delivering value. An offer is one or more products presented to the market. The offer is the thing that we wrap around the product to convey and communicate the value that that product might deliver to someone. An offer has a promise, whereas a product has a function. In the course of delivering and creating, we create multiple products that we can create offers around and serve us as assets. The more offers we have, the more maximal our economics are. If we want leverage, then we have to have maximal economics. Maximal economics is the highest practical number of offers and the highest potential conversion across our audience. In the sovereign way, this is how we desire to have a small audience, but we have converted a large portion of those people into customers and clients, and we do that through offers. ## The Client Workshop Flywheel: Unbundling for Asset Creation **Summary:** James explains how client workshops can be unbundled and leveraged as a product, creating a positive flywheel for customer acquisition and client development. He describes how more clients lead to more opportunities for creation, further fueling the flywheel

. ## The Client Workshop Flywheel: Unbundling for Asset Creation **Summary:** James explains how client workshops can be unbundled and leveraged as a product, creating a positive flywheel for customer acquisition and client development. He describes how more clients lead to more opportunities for creation, further fueling the flywheel. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** The first level of unbundling is this workshop. Right now, I am unbundling. If you are delivering to your clients with frequency, then you are creating products with frequency. By selling tickets to client workshops, you are unbundling a feature of your bundled product. The flywheel is: I create a workshop for clients, and I've created a product. I sell tickets to the workshop, and when I sell a ticket, I've created a customer. I invite those customers to become clients, and then I've created a client. And then I create workshops for those people, and I can go round and round that flywheel for as long as I need to. The flywheel is a positive flywheel because the more clients you have, the more you can afford to deliver, which means the more variables that you have in your client base, the more that you can create for your client base. When you have a few clients, it's more difficult to have a high level of creation because creation has to come from somewhere. You guys inspire me to create more stuff because you go out in the world and you come across speed bumps or problems or opportunities, and then you bring them back. We diagnose them, and then we look at ways to get around them, get over them, or harness them. So the more clients you have, the easier it is to be on a cycle of creation because people are bringing problems and opportunities into your world that you can then solve for by creating trainings, resources, cheat sheets, whatever it is to get them around that. ## Every Product an Asset: Maximizing Yield and Distribution **Summary:** James highlights how every product created, including workshop recordings, can be treated as an asset with multiple yield opportunities. He points out that many businesses underutilize their existing assets and encourages strategic distribution to maximize their value. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** When you have that positive flywheel, you are on an asset creation cycle, because every single product you create largely becomes an asset. The recording of this workshop is an asset. I've got many, many ways I could yield that. I could chop it up and break it into multiple products. I could sell it as a singular product. I could rent it to somebody else via a licensing agreement. So once I've created something, I am looking for ways to turn it into one or more assets and having that on a positive flywheel. We can extend that idea to every product inside our world. In my experience, it's the same with creating lead magnets. Most people are sitting on a ton of assets that they're not distributing or yielding. You're sitting on such a high volume of training, material, and resources that you don't know which one to put out. The equation simply says, well, what does the market bear and understand? The variable returns I get from all the different assets are vast. There are singular $100 workshops that have yielded over six figures for me, and there are ones that have barely registered on the scoreboard. The time investment was the same, but the output and the value equation in the marketplace was perceived as different. ## Bundling Basics: Creating Clear Value Propositions and Transformations **Summary:** James explains that bundling, the traditional approach in coaching and consulting, involves combining multiple products into a single offer with a clear outcome and preferential pricing. He outlines the three key components of a bundled offer: content/training, community, and customization

. The time investment was the same, but the output and the value equation in the marketplace was perceived as different. ## Bundling Basics: Creating Clear Value Propositions and Transformations **Summary:** James explains that bundling, the traditional approach in coaching and consulting, involves combining multiple products into a single offer with a clear outcome and preferential pricing. He outlines the three key components of a bundled offer: content/training, community, and customization. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Traditionally, every coaching and consulting business is bundled, and when you look under the hood, there are a number of products inside that can be unbundled. Bundling is very, very simple because it's the thing that people do and have done for a long time. If you come to a syndicate call and I ask you what your offer is, the thing that you will present me will be a bundled offer. By bundling our products together and creating an offer with an outcome, we can have a clear value proposition: if you buy this, you will get this. If you are seeking to install any transformation in someone, then we bundle together the three requirements: content (training, material), community (where we bring people together to collaborate), and customization (group calls, one-on-one calls, messaging, access to coaches). A bundle will always have preferential pricing over individual parts. So when we bundle something together, it is at a pricing level lower than the individual components would be priced at separately. Bundling is efficient and allows a prospect to see potential transformation much more clearly. The sum of the parts is available at a lower price point than buying them individually. ## Bundled Offers: Easier to Create, Harder to Sell **Summary:** While bundled offers are generally easier to create, they can be more challenging to sell due to the need to align prospects with a specific value equation. James emphasizes the importance of identifying the individual components of an offer to understand and communicate its value effectively. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Bundled offers are, in some ways, easier to create and harder to sell because you have to align people with the value equation. The value equation being the current perceived value of the desire they had. What value does someone see in me mentoring them to get to a million dollars a year? That variable is going to be vast in terms of how much they'll invest, how long they will invest, how quickly they will decide to do it, etc. To have any bundling and unbundling pathway, we need to come back to the central idea, which is the value equation. To see the value equation, firstly, we must see the individual parts of our delivery. What are the components of your current offers? How do we put the goggles on and see them as individual products or parts? And then what do we do with them? We can only communicate the value in something after we identify that it's valuable in the first place. Unbundling 101 is identifying that particular things inside your world probably have an outsized value over and above other things. And then, if we can see those things, we can define their value and make offers around them. ## Unbundling the Syndicate: Creating Multiple Value Equations **Summary:** James uses his own Syndicate program as an example of how to unbundle a bundled offer. By assigning individual values to the training portal, community, and group calls, he can create separate offers catering to different value equations and market segments. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** This is a simple exercise that I did on my stuff. I have the syndicate. The syndicate is made up of three products: a training portal, a community, and group calls

because their value equation is different. They don't see value in the calls. Their current value equation is, if I get access to the training, then that's what I see the highest rate of return for me relative to my investment. ## Unbundling for Creativity and Market Segmentation **Summary:** James explains how unbundling allows for creative offer creation and taps into different market segments by allowing prospects to choose the components they value most. He highlights how this approach can lead to clients eventually bundling the components themselves as they recognize the value of the other parts. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** By unbundling and looking at those as individual components, we can productize every part of what we're doing and what we have. These things, when you go to the marketplace, will also surprise you at where value is perceived. Access tends to be the highest priority value. If people want transformation, they tend to lean towards, "Can I have one-on-one calls? Can I have access?" By giving them access to that, I could sell access to the Syndicate weekly calls for $150 a week, because they would perceive that if they come to those calls, then they would get a higher rate of return based on what they're doing. But in the course of that, they might realize that having access to the community is super valuable as well, and then they add on the access to the community and the training, for example, and they eventually end up bundling those things themselves. So bundling and unbundling allows a lot of creativity, but it also allows you to tap into bits of the market that perceive value in different ways. ## The Circle: An Assemblage of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Offers **Summary:** James describes his "Circle" offer as an assemblage of various unbundled products, allowing clients to choose their own adventure and customize their value equation. He explains how this approach encourages clients to buy multiple products by highlighting the value of each individual component. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:**, what I do with the Circle is just put everything in there as the simplest way of doing it. In the Circle, there's a dedicated group call, there's one-on-one access, there's WhatsApp, and the Circle includes the Bali Blueprint. I also sell all of those things individually, apart from the Circle group call. What you have is an assemblage of the choose-your-own-adventure where people can set their own value equation. One of the reasons why a huge proportion of people who come into my world buy something else is because I've made it easy to buy something else, because I've highlighted the value on a particular product. One of the reasons that a huge amount of people who are on my email list have bought products is because I unbundle those products and make them very easy and accessible to buy. It's really important that we have a map first, because a map and being able to see these things allows us to test and experiment with the market about what they perceive value at. ## Experimentation and Speed: Adapting to the Evolving Marketplace **Summary:** James discusses the increasing importance of experimentation and speed in the market, particularly in the AI space, where prototypes and real-time product interaction are becoming the norm. He advocates for a product/asset-driven approach, emphasizing that people are more likely to buy products than marketing. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** The experimentation and speed has become ever more important. I'm talking to people in the AI space right now, and they have gone from having to do mock-ups and theoretical designs to building prototypes in front of people in real time and playing with the product in real time. The market is moving towards that where people expect things to almost function to a full extent right in front of them

by at least 14 to 20% my :23 recurring Revenue proportion is over 80% of monthly Revenue so I'm by all :28 and I'm and I made six figures profit this month M didn't quite make six figures last month but I will this month :34 and by every conceivable metric is going up but it's boring yeah isn't that isn't :41 that weird to say that I felt a couple of times of that grind up of just watching the everything just go up yeah :49 and it i' at a couple of moments I felt frustrated with it that I want to feel :55 that that time I did 100 Grand in a day I want a rush from it yeah it still happens to me yeah cuz I've had 100 :01 Grand day before I had a I've got a striped screenshot to bloody prove it of of 100K coming in right and I was :10 that felt amazing I want that feeling again yeah it's not on any scalability :18 on any business completely irrational but those feelings still come :24 but that doesn't mean we're completely led by our feelings because our feelings will implode our :29 business because sometimes the feeling is this is boring but I but I :34 have been particularly susceptible to that right so I had to share that cuz I'm very proud of myself if we're :40 getting very honest I had to have many conversations earlier in the year when I was a couple of months ahead of you :45 in terms of the new model and you were I'm thinking about doing this I'm think about doing this and I was yeah talk down from the ledge just do :51 this yeah yeah yeah talk down from the ledge f so let's talk about getting clients because we talk about offer pricing model and we can talk about :58 team as well to wrap up to round out the 100K a month yeah what's a team I say that as I'm about to hire four :05 people and I can talk about that as well getting clients hasir evolved and also the fundamentals haven't changed :12 and we need to stand out in a way that we don't look every other coach I remember when I first started :19 selling our coaching offer in 2020 I'd done coaching previous to :24 that but I was mainly running an agency I ran an offer we would get sales calls I was doing the sales calls earlier and :30 I was hey how are you different from XYZ person right super common then :36 we were selling groups and it was the next iteration of our offer and I was how are you different from this other person who's also selling :42 groups now I don't get that question ever yeah right and so there's a :47 marketing content positioning piece that we can talk about here but let's talk about the fundamental pieces :53 of of how you would go about getting to 100K a month if you're making some money :58 and you're trying to scale up your acquisition trying to get enough leads lead nurture conversion how would you :04 think about that right now and let's say someone doesn't have any money to spend on paid ads or they have very little so :10 it's probably going to be organic to start out with what would you suggest platform strategy all of those :16 foundational things yeah so let's make the assumption that everybody's on something y from the beginning they're :22 on they're on some social media some many people on Facebook some are on Instagram some on cocaine maybe :28 all of the above I I believe in terms of when you're talking about if we we I :33 always work backwards towards the market so I always start at offers and then I work backwards towards the marketing :39 because everything you want to happen in the back end is just there's just fractals of what happens in the front so :46 I'm I'm big on the big idea what is that dream outcome that you're taking people towards and

some are on Instagram some on cocaine maybe :28 all of the above I I believe in terms of when you're talking about if we we I :33 always work backwards towards the market so I always start at offers and then I work backwards towards the marketing :39 because everything you want to happen in the back end is just there's just fractals of what happens in the front so :46 I'm I'm big on the big idea what is that dream outcome that you're taking people towards and you're :51 starting to shape that up that you can going over the next 12 months I'm going to take people here because they need to :58 be pre-old on that idea of that before they before they buy anything yeah so I'm I'm big on having a big idea :05 pre-selling the big idea of you're going to become this I've got this concept of a CO Sovereign consultant right how to make a million bucks a year :11 with 50 clients or less it's it's a binary concept you either buy into that or you don't there's no :17 judgment around that yeah so the more I talk about that Concept in the in the platforms of choice that I use the more :24 people start to buy in that that idea and their curiosity leads them down the track what's the Sovereign consultant :29 what are the characteristics how do how do I access different pieces of those so I framing up a big idea is :37 usually around the identity what identity you're helping someone become or if you're truly unique around :43 identity and mechanism what mechanism you're using so big idea :48 unique unique mechanism those are those are proven Concepts and then talk about it and incessantly on the :54 platform that people are paying attention on and then when you get people engaging with that you understand their intent to the point where if :01 you're really at the beginning you need to know why that person liked that post :07 what level of intent was that was that intent it's your grandma showing you support or is that intent of :13 hey I'm picking up what you're putting down this might be worth the conversation yeah so at the beginning you've got the time to tune into the :20 intent signals of how people are interacting with your stuff but you've got to make stuff in the first place :25 yeah and that's where people struggle with content is what do I talk about but and then if you've got that :31 big idea you can pull bits out of it and talk about those the pieces of that big idea as you go along and then :37 understand how people interact with it so it's all about content ads are :43 content organic is content video is content written is content you got to :48 make content on the platform that you're already on that's getting some Traction in a way that is natural to you that is :55 consistent and sustainable yeah you do video I write they they we we're :00 both making a lot of content but we're doing it in different modalities that suit us because we can be consistent y :06 you can make consistent video I can write till the cows come home so one platform y one idea and :16 then and then it's just doing the Reps on the on the content and pulling the ideas and then understanding as people :21 engage and and what intent is behind it and you I could trust you for the the smart stuff I'm going to give people the :26 dumb stuff so firstly you can obviously do make good videos make offo :32 post a tweet so there's a lot of ways to get clients right there's I :37 I'm friends with people who send cold emails yeah and that's not appealing to me not cuz it doesn't work :42 totally works everything works that's the problem yeah yeah but I think there are pros and cons depending on the business you're trying to build and so :48 one of the issues with let's say

dumb stuff so firstly you can obviously do make good videos make offo :32 post a tweet so there's a lot of ways to get clients right there's I :37 I'm friends with people who send cold emails yeah and that's not appealing to me not cuz it doesn't work :42 totally works everything works that's the problem yeah yeah but I think there are pros and cons depending on the business you're trying to build and so :48 one of the issues with let's say you just send 100 cold DS a day totally works and I think it's a great way to :53 it's a great thing to peer alongside creating content the problem is the moment you stop sending the messages is :59 the moment the leads stop coming in yeah as opposed to building an audience that has a connection with you that's an asset that lasts longer than the moment :05 of piece of content you've just created yeah and so I think the thing that we can both agree on is that you need one platform right when people are getting :11 started they shouldn't be doing five different platforms a redistribution strategy I'm posting tweets here and shorts here and Tik toks here one :18 platform my two favorite platforms I'd be interested to know what you think about LinkedIn but I personally Facebook Facebook and Instagram Facebook :25 is so damn easy to start organically you just add people and your audience :30 grows that Instagram much harder to grow organically we're posting two reals a :36 day right now and we I'm getting really decent growth 10 to 20 people a day and then I might be on a :42 podcast and I think I've had a th Facebook Instagram followers in the last month so it's been working well :47 organically but typically the only traction that I see clients consistently get is when they're running ads yeah so :53 if we're talking no budget it's Facebook what do you think about LinkedIn and :58 then how do people choose what platform that they should use all of the platforms work yeah so for me it's :04 always the one that they're already on that they're getting traction on right and I've had a couple of clients recently going I don't think my people :10 are on this platform and walking away from 14k followers on Instagram and you're going I think my :17 people are on LinkedIn it's don't do you it's it's 8020 you're incrementally at it I'm I'm I'm my two :24 platforms are Facebook and email right because I use Facebook to get people onto email where I can make offers yeah :31 that's all and also Facebook's a really good platform in the sense that the :37 people we are trying to reach also spend a lot of time on it as their primary thing so James and I don't feel any :43 smarter when we sit around scrolling the newsfeed but it's easily the opposite :48 it's easily my favorite platform to get started on you post content it's where the majority of if you're talking :54 about volume the most amount of people in any app are on Facebook right even to this day people who don't use Facebook :01 their their screen time would show otherwise everyone is using it in some capacity it has messenger it's great you :07 can post stories you can send messages you can post content on your newsfeed :13 and it's relatively easy to get leads because you just add people and you can go into Facebook groups and you can add :18 people now some of you might be saying well I just want people to track me down and you're great earn that :24 right but in the beginning when you're just starting out you need to you need to pursue the leads to then earn the right to be pursued yeah when it comes :30 to content let's say people are choosing a platform yeah right I think they need to choose the thing that :36 they're Mo they're best at I don't

Facebook groups and you can add :18 people now some of you might be saying well I just want people to track me down and you're great earn that :24 right but in the beginning when you're just starting out you need to you need to pursue the leads to then earn the right to be pursued yeah when it comes :30 to content let's say people are choosing a platform yeah right I think they need to choose the thing that :36 they're Mo they're best at I don't know if and and they can be consistent now yeah ex that's where the results come :42 from so let's talk about that I think a lot of people are I have to write yeah and they hate writing yeah or that :48 I have to make video and they're terrible on camera the the likelihood of you being of you :54 consistently doing something that you hate and you're really bad at is very low damn I tell you what sometimes :00 as see people making videos I'm you've got a face for radio baby stop making videos I see people write and go :06 you need to be on video yeah yeah 100% so it's it's what can you do consistently yeah and then because it :12 all works it all works yeah I I the distinction between Facebook :18 and Linkedin that you have connections on Facebook it is human to to :23 have your connection Twitter Instagram YouTube I'll include Tik Tok I'm not :29 even on T I don't understand it you have followers so on one platform you :34 have connections yeah so you're one step down the down the relationship :40 hierarchy on the others you have followers which is vague levels of interest that people might pay attention :46 to your staff or leave a thumbs down on your YouTube video but Facebook Facebook and Linkedin the m fact that you can :53 have a connection means that you can get traction faster because you are one step closer to developing a :58 relationship and talking to a person whereas on the other on the other one they're following you then you need to :04 understand whether you have a connection and you can start a conversation to have that so you just get traction faster on :10 those platforms because the very nature of the way that you can 100% you've got you you're connecting with John :18 Johnson on Facebook and he has his real photo and he's got pictures of his kids and then you go on Twitter and you've :24 got Surfer guy 79 talking crap and he's got a picture of a cat but my favorite :31 story around this is to understand the difference in the quality of followers the distinction is on Facebook you can never do business with :37 people who have profile pictures of babies dogs or a cars yeah yeah yeah :44 100% so but never to work one of my favorite stories to illustrate this point was a girl had 1

.5 million :49 Tik Tok followers yes and she said she was going to do a meet up in LA she did a meet up no one came and this is also :55 true of Twitter I know plenty of people on Twitter that have more :00 followers than they make dollars per month that's not uncommon that would be the norm that's normal right then for us :06 we've made Millions from thousands of people not tens of thousands not hundreds of thousands singled digit :12 thousands so it's I haven't even maxed out my Facebook friends yeah yeah exactly I'm in the minority in that I've :18 only got two and a half or 3,000 or whatever the number I love it kill a head right how I made but anyway so :25 so it all the all that they all work but I do think they have really obvious pros and cons that's why I do :31 Facebook over Tik Tok it's not that it can't work I had someone Reach Out me the other day he helped people get :37 clients with Tik Tok he had a million of followers he was broke yeah right so it's just different platforms one of the :44 things that I've become really passionate about and I think we would be really similar to this is your platforms are Facebook and and email not just :52 because email is a really cool platform but there's just a distinct well tell tell me really quickly to :59 help it flesh out the the your thinking behind it of the relationship you feel you have with people who read :05 your newsletter or your daily email so don't want to get too scientific but different different :12 platforms and different communication channels have different levels of entropy so if you're posting something :18 on Instagram the life cycle of that is 24 hours MH it's it's :24 there and pretty much gone even if it's in the feed or those things very few things have any life cycle past a few :31 days at the other end of the social spectrum is YouTube we can watch YouTube videos from 5 six 10 years ago and :38 they're still great so they have low they have just low levels of Decay there's still assets there email is a is :45 a unique Channel because it's got pretty low levels of I have people responding today to emails I sent two :51 weeks ago so there's a there's a low level of entropy that doesn't every email adds something to :57 the communication channel it's one of the last private understanding :02 privacy and the private channels that if I send you an email that you're the only person who's reading it whereas :08 in Social we've got this even though the algorithms even though the algorithms are tuned to us we're :14 everybody's seeing it so email's got a personal thing and and and the third thing with email is that you own it yeah :21 which is the unique thing you these days that's less true because people are being deplatformed and those things yeah but largely :28 you own the list you should back it up but but if you have somehow been deplatform from email you've done something really wrong you really you're :35 on a list somewhere yeah and so so why I brought that up is because my preferred is Facebook and YouTube for for me :42 personally and why I that is because even though you can write long on Facebook it just it's a clunkier :47 platform the scroll you write 500 words on Facebook it's just harder to navigate there's ads vying for your :55 attention and so the peering of thinking short form and long form Facebook is amazing for awareness :01 growing your audience engagement having a long form platform for depth connection trust that real sense of :09 personal connection is amazing and so when I started YouTube 5 months ago firstly I knew I should have started it :15 5 years ago that was plan number one and then I joined Sam M's program he's content stupid just run ads and

harder to navigate there's ads vying for your :55 attention and so the peering of thinking short form and long form Facebook is amazing for awareness :01 growing your audience engagement having a long form platform for depth connection trust that real sense of :09 personal connection is amazing and so when I started YouTube 5 months ago firstly I knew I should have started it :15 5 years ago that was plan number one and then I joined Sam M's program he's content stupid just run ads and I was PR of the people :23 and so we did that and then I cired back start of the year and I was I'm going to do this and my business has :28 just gone this since I started creating long form content and it's because people binge it so firstly :36 this is going to be 2 hours by the time we're done there will be some die hards still listening there will also be some :42 die hards who listen to the first one there will also be some die hards that go straight from this one into another one right I'm a high YouTube consumer if :50 I have high screen time it's mainly me listening to to stuff on YouTube and so having something that people can go :55 really deep with you on is a really powerful thing to do the problem with most people is they post lots of content :01 and they wonder why with all of their consistency why there's not this audience being built even if it's :06 building wide it's not going deep because you haven't given them anything to really latch on to so this is why :12 Twitter you have when I see the amount of posts that tweet Twitter people have done cuz it's got the :18 little metric they've got 100,000 followers and they've tweeted 100,000 times I'm my my brain explodes I :26 may have done I may have done a thousand posts on Facebook I have no idea but but my point being you have to follow :32 someone on Twitter for so long to ever consider giveing them $5,000 yeah right and so I really this peering and so :39 however people do it I think whether they do one platform and they post short things and then they do long videos :46 X Twitter we we've been calling it Twitter this whole time we're so we're so old right now so X baby it's :52 going to date this content real so so I think you can have the same effect if you just drop podcasts and YouTube and :58 things that long form on Facebook the point is you should have content consistently right that's short :04 medium long right you can post stor can access easily to binge yes because this characteristic of binging is super :10 interesting to me and I've got a very poorly defined concept around total attention time cuz when I was doing :16 sales calls I always used to hear this thing of just before someone would would jump on a call they're oh :21 used to i i i i binged your content right and then they they turn up the next day and buy stuff right and I've :27 got this theory of total attention time that if there is a if there's a a lump of time that people spend with you :33 intensely over a period of time and that's condensed they they they watch they watch you every day for seven :41 days the the likelihood that that they're going to become a client or reach out to you or take an action on that is multiple times of someone :48 who's watched exactly the same content over 12 months y and you need somewhere that allows that total attention time :55 YouTube allows it it allows people to bench on your stuff email does as well because people can you :02 know sort and categorize things and look for them the other social platforms less so because of algorithms and it you can :08 have profiles and those things but it's not natural for people to go and click on someone's profile and read

# New Transcripts James - Part 2

. When we hit 10 k. Of sales. James Kemp: and I put the pay plan secondary. So I'll let you finance the initial 5 K. Over 12 weeks at 500 per week. James Kemp: Then I have a qualifier. You're probably doing these things. You're probably dissatisfied with this. You have these things right? James Kemp: And we are more defined. James Kemp: What about who we don't work with and who we do. James Kemp: People need some basic stuff for this to work. People need James Kemp: at least the identification of an audience. And they need something to sell James Kemp: for most of for most people that I work within this. It's not a lack of opportunity to produce an install offer or produce something this. It's an abundance because they help people with about 10 different things, and then we isolate it down to one. In my experience that's much more common than a beginner coming along and say, I don't have a skill, and I don't know what to do. The people who come to me tend to have too many skills, and then we're sharpening them and refining them down. James Kemp: So pricing the pricing is elegant. Shall we say so? James Kemp: If you, if you look at the frame acquisition offers are generally sold to people who have not been clients before. They may have bought low ticket offers. They may have bought customer offers from you. They may even be in a a membership, or something that, where they have a low level of access to you. James Kemp: but they have not had direct and intimate access before. And they're stepping up another trust level. And they're stepping up another pricing level. James Kemp: So James Kemp: reducing perceived risk and opening the door for them to continue with you is we can bake into pricing. James Kemp: So the way that I price these that I found most effective over the years is having a risk, reversal pricing or a risk reduction pricing. There's no such thing as risk removal James Kemp: where there is an upfront payment, and then a secondary payment. Once the milestone is hit. James Kemp: This works on 2 fronts, which is why I love it because it reduces the risk, because you are sharing some of the risk by saying, I will delay. James Kemp: I will delay the payment of this until the results turn. James Kemp: but it also enables you to have a secondary conversation once the result is achieved, you then have James Kemp: the the the energy of the money there that you can deploy in the right way. So what I do is I say James Kemp: you don't owe me 5 K. What I'm going to do is credit that against the next year of the syndicate, and that makes your your weekly payment. Just X. If you'd to stick around. James Kemp: So what that does is deploys the energy of that potential money, and it turns it into a potential benefit for the client that they can then James Kemp: cash in without going into their pocket, because it's free money that then they can deploy to invest over the long term. James Kemp: And that means that we can use that potential energy of that dollar figure to deploy something and and help someone make it easy to stick around, but also allow them to potentially open up a world where they step up in terms of the level of service, or even just stick around, even at a lower level. James Kemp: So I found that that style of pricing extremely effective. And it's obviously relative the the dollar figure James Kemp: is relative to the offer that you've got in the market. You've got, if you're selling to corporate. Then 5 K is way too low. If you're selling, probably fitness and personal transformation, it's probably pretty high

. James Kemp: So I found that that style of pricing extremely effective. And it's obviously relative the the dollar figure James Kemp: is relative to the offer that you've got in the market. You've got, if you're selling to corporate. Then 5 K is way too low. If you're selling, probably fitness and personal transformation, it's probably pretty high. But that if you match the figures, a thousand and a thousand, 2,000 22,000 20,000. Then I've seen it work at all those particular levels. I've seen it work at 50 K and 50 k. As well. James Kemp: So the that offer structure when you've got a growth offer on the back of it works very well to convert pricing structure. Rather, it also very works very well to ascend. James Kemp: So I just wanna before we jump into Q. And A. I just want to talk about delivery and some of the new ones here. James Kemp: The delivery of my install offer has 1 1 on one call right. James Kemp: there will be. If you. If you make a promise. James Kemp: you will have a level of customization and delivering your offer. If you want to control the outcome. James Kemp: I am leaving too much to chance. If I have an offer this, and I just throw someone into the community and go have at it and work it out and watch the trainings right? That works at a low investment level where I can't dedicate the time to to, directing that person and giving them a plan. But but at higher investment levels, where you're promising an roi. James Kemp: you need to control the the flow as much as you can, because you still rely on the client to do some work, to to a greater or lesser extent. James Kemp: so all to say, there will be a level of customization involved in delivering your offer. James Kemp: Get that done early and quickly. If that means that you need multiple one on one calls or intensive service delivery in the 1st few days of the 1st week of the client engagement, do it, then James Kemp: front, load the delivery to set up the conditions for success. So you've got the next 7, 12, James Kemp: 15 weeks to unpack the result James Kemp: the the faster this is completed, the faster the client is in motion, and the faster you can move to the next client, which is increased capacity. James Kemp: If you want to run a small lean business with just you, and, minimal overhead to minimal infrastructure. James Kemp: The velocity that you clear clients through the system James Kemp: is matters more than most things about your growth potential, right? Because James Kemp: every time you have a level of customization you're doing a service, or you're one on one with a client. It has energy expenditure, right. James Kemp: how much James Kemp: how much it takes out of you, shall we say for a call, or doing work, or writing copy, or delivering, delivering pieces for the client

. It has energy expenditure, right. James Kemp: how much James Kemp: how much it takes out of you, shall we say for a call, or doing work, or writing copy, or delivering, delivering pieces for the client. James Kemp: the the if you, if you meter those and get them towards the front of it, and then you move through into a lower touch or a lower stress environment, you'll be able to put more clients through the system right? James Kemp: What tends to happen with most people is that they try and stretch out the delivery over a longer period of time, and then they then they end up clogging the system because they've got so much delivery liability coming up that they can't sell the people now right? I could sell the off the offer in store every week and just roll James Kemp: I I want, okay, I'm gonna do 5 1 on one calls next week, and then I'm gonna sell it next week and do 5 1 on one calls the week after. If I had, if I stretch those out I would be compounding that delivery responsibility right? And this is really James Kemp: subtle, and the people who have delivered to any level will know what I'm talking about. But if you stretch out and you start offering a lot of service delivery and you try and flatten it over multiple weeks or even months. James Kemp: you severely limit your ability to grow on the front end because you can't take in and ingest clients, and then get them through because you are compounding delivery because you are setting up multiple hours of delivery in the future, and that clock that limits your ability to to sign a client now. James Kemp: So what I do is, again, in the what we do together. I'm clear about how how it works. We do an offer install call with me. We create, offers, campaigns, messages, copy, and strategy. James Kemp: Then I direct the client. I direct the person to. Once we've completed that offer. Sometimes we complete it fully on the call. If it's if it's super simple. Often there's a little bit to get done. Then I I tell them to bring it back to me for feedback. We've got 2 calls a week. We've got a community. So we've got multiple touch points. James Kemp: So this is very scalable for me, because there's 1 1 on one component which is the lowest leverage thing I do, and then it's into a high leverage environment where we can provide feedback adequately. But that one on one call establishes the specificity of the offer, the timeframe and the frame around it, and then I've got assets that sit around that to make it scalable. James Kemp: so James Kemp: all to say, front load delivery, and compress it into the shortest period of time possible with the most intensive pieces. The more you do that, the more you can move through clients and sign them up. James Kemp: Wants to do an install offer. James Kemp: No, Jared. Jarred Brown: I'd love to. And then and if I can ask a question just about that, so you're just Jarred Brown: peaking the terms and centralizing their focus for the start of their syndicate experience. right, that's all. It is Jarred Brown: My question before we trial it out Jarred Brown: with with mine. It does. It does the length. Jarred Brown: But what's the minimum length in which you would do it? And does it? Does the pricing Jarred Brown: just the even split matter. So someone joins the summit. It's a 3 k. Painful for the year. Jarred Brown: which means half of that would be 1,500

. It is Jarred Brown: My question before we trial it out Jarred Brown: with with mine. It does. It does the length. Jarred Brown: But what's the minimum length in which you would do it? And does it? Does the pricing Jarred Brown: just the even split matter. So someone joins the summit. It's a 3 k. Painful for the year. Jarred Brown: which means half of that would be 1,500. Half of the time would be 6 months, could I? Could I bring it down to 4 weeks. Jarred Brown: Or is that, okay, cool, are we able to to jam on that potentially James Kemp: in in real terms. The faster someone gets a result, the more valuable the offer Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: If you had an offer that says, Well, I promise to make a million dollars with you in the next 7 days. James Kemp: it would sell pretty well Jarred Brown: It would James Kemp: Right. So the faster the faster you can generate a result. James Kemp: and the more meaningful that result is to the individual. James Kemp: the the simpler that offer is to sell. Jarred Brown: And so Jarred Brown: deliver a specific mechanism over a short period of time. The one on one calls. Surrounded by that mechanism, they fall into the summit, and then the full way to the summit is just us. Jarred Brown:, on this going back and forth around that that particular one mechanism. Jarred Brown: So then, if it's a 4 week experience, would I just then apply that credit as, if you would to continue with this and just apply that credit, so my pricing might not be an even split. My! But how would I then frame up the how do you think I could position the Jarred Brown: pay now and then pay then. position. How would I frame that up with the ideal of them moving into the summit James Kemp: You don't have that ideal. And this is, this is where the danger arises. Right? James Kemp: You have to fucking. Deliver on the offer. James Kemp: If you're just doing this as a way to get them into a 12 month thing, you will fail Jarred Brown: Okay. Ideal wasn't the wrong way. James Kemp: By night. By then you a a a workshop. What did I say a couple of weeks ago? James Kemp: Deliver everything on the workshop. Every outcome is out of your control. Jarred Brown: Every outcome of decision making of what the client make is out of your control. James Kemp: Everybody who's not a member of the membership or the syndicate here is they're nuts right James Kemp: by not being members, but they will. They will come to that conclusion on their own. James Kemp: But delivering in a workshop is about delivering in the workshop, delivering in an acquisition offer is about delivering on the thing. What happens after we set up the conditions for it to happen. James Kemp: But if you have a I'm going to do this, so I can get this James Kemp: it it will not get this Jarred Brown: Sorry I was meaning more. I I completely understand it and completely agree with you. I was meaningful more from the pricing perspective. How do you feel I can play with that pricing frame? If I'm if I'm gonna offer and trial out a 4 week experience, you've got the the 5 K. Now 5 k. Then Jarred Brown: how would I position that with the contrast of the summit for the other 48 years James Kemp: I, Jarred Brown: 40 James Kemp: Let's do it, because that's talking in the theoretical is pointless. Jarred Brown: Okay. Cool

. Now 5 k. Then Jarred Brown: how would I position that with the contrast of the summit for the other 48 years James Kemp: I, Jarred Brown: 40 James Kemp: Let's do it, because that's talking in the theoretical is pointless. Jarred Brown: Okay. Cool. James Kemp: What are you going to do? Jarred Brown: The the big one is the alter ego at the minute, which is Comp comes down to confidence and hesitation. So it's the alter ego advantage, which is what it's called Jarred Brown: The main things that are popping up and people joining the summit recently have all been around Jarred Brown: hesitating key. Moments. self doubt. And so the alter ego is all around. Confidence, hesitation, Stutter holding back in the performance. Jarred Brown: So it's Jarred Brown: a good athlete or an okay athlete will see something. Think about it, may not do it. A great athlete will see it, act on it instinctively, and go after James Kemp: That I. James Kemp: It's e ea a LTEE r right Jarred Brown: Yeah. Yeah. Jarred Brown: Nope. James Kemp: How long. Jarred Brown: Full weights James Kemp: So here you'd put I coach James Kemp: you put something alter egos one of the many components I install into my professional clients. James Kemp: Luckily for you, I'll I I can do this as a 1 off Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: Which is just Jarred Brown: Would you James Kemp: Component after it Jarred Brown: Where would you use the whereabouts would you use Jarred Brown: in the summit? Step 4. Where would you use the language when you break down that in your Jarred Brown: my summer off a dock as an example James Kemp: I understand. Jarred Brown: So I just punched it. Jarred Brown: I just punched it in the chat. But . Jarred Brown:, what is the alter ego, for example? Jarred Brown: Great athletes don't hesitate. Okay. Athletes. Second, guess and play within their shell. All of this comes down to breaking fear and boosting confidence James Kemp: You can explain what it is Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: Acquisition offers, and an install offer specifically James Kemp: talks to people who already feel that that is the solution. Right Jarred Brown: Okay. James Kemp: They may not, they may not call it that Jarred Brown: Okay, that's why I might change that. Then I might change the name James Kemp: What we have to think about in offers is what context is created before them. James Kemp: Hmm, 2 point. James Kemp: So if someone is solution aware, they are looking for the solution James Kemp: right? And then they're looking for. Who's going to provide the solution? James Kemp: This is not the place that we would educate someone on what the James Kemp: what the best solution is. Or maybe I just need to train harder. Maybe I need to have a better mindset. These are people are . James Kemp: I need that older ego, and I need to carry it with me, and I need to take it on the field straight away, because James Kemp: I've understood the benefit from that right Jarred Brown: Yeah, the language is probably more Jarred Brown: confidence, so I'll probably make it something the confidence total. Jarred Brown:, I don't think athletes athletes aren't identifying. Don't need an alter ego. They're identifying. Don't I need more confidence James Kemp: You can., you can link those things together. Because if. James Kemp: obviously, Todd's book and those things educated the market a bit a lot on these things

. Jarred Brown:, I don't think athletes athletes aren't identifying. Don't need an alter ego. They're identifying. Don't I need more confidence James Kemp: You can., you can link those things together. Because if. James Kemp: obviously, Todd's book and those things educated the market a bit a lot on these things. There's examples of professional athletes using them James Kemp: so Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: The education and the market doesn't need to come from you. James Kemp: but lots of people know that they need an offer. James Kemp: and I'm not the only one talking about it selling it, or anything that. It's a benefit that the market gets educated towards solutions Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: We don't have a monopoly on most things. We just have a monopoly on on the central idea of how we do it Jarred Brown: Yeah, that's fine. I can test the names, anyway. James Kemp: This is me you James Kemp: so is it an older ego? Jarred Brown: Yeah, the alt. The alter ego is Jarred Brown: the tool that they get. The outcome is confidence in split second moments James Kemp: Yeah, so you could, you could talk to that. There. James Kemp: Our goal is a New year. James Kemp: In 4 weeks you'll have a a new James Kemp: level headed clear-headed., calm under pressure. James Kemp: persona, that you can, that you can activate within 5 min and carry it onto the field every Saturday Jarred Brown: Yep. Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: So again, specificity. And if it isn't an objective thing we can point at money or time or weight, or anything that's objectively measurable. We have the objective experience of what it generates. James Kemp: So you walk you . Describe that person James Kemp: 5 min before the game activating the order ego running onto the field. Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: You feel you're a foot taller and a foot wider, and, a yard faster and etc, etc, you go to town on James Kemp: describing the person they become. James Kemp: Because, yeah, all all personal development stuff is is building a better version of the person in the future. Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: So when I say specificity in that. But you are describing exactly that per the that version of the person in the future Jarred Brown: Yeah, no, I. It's very active right now with Nico. So that's okay. I can break his his experience down, because we're Jarred Brown: been speaking about before performance in performance, post performance, and the intricacies of that. So that's sweet James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: So understand, over 4 weeks we install. James Kemp: So you'd you'd put the pros that you work with. There Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: Your alter ego that you can. James Kemp: what are they going to do?, it sounds a schizophrenic, carrying around an alter ego with them, but Jarred Brown: Forward to 10 scenario 4 weeks. We install your Alta Edo. Jarred Brown: Are you trying to move? But that you can use before the weekend's performance, are you? Is that what you're going at here? Is it? James Kemp: And you can turn on at will. Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: I think people don't know what at well means. You can turn on when you need. James Kemp: It's a hymn right Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: And then that would be the description of that Jarred Brown: The mechanism

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 11

. This "more of the same" approach caters to different consumption preferences and maximizes the value offered within the funnel. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** when I asked Chris yesterday, I'm, What's the what's the message about the book funnel ? What's the how should people think about it? He said. Something that's, very simple in terms of its concept, which is more of the same. If someone is buying the book. Then they are interested in the concept of the book and the problems it solves and the solutions it ultimately has. So what do you put on the in the funnel? You put more of that in there. Right you go deeper, you go wider, you add more additional pieces, and and you put more stuff in it. ## A Simple Book Funnel Structure and its Conversion Metrics **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a basic book funnel structure, including a lead capture, order form, bump offer, upsell, and downsell. He shares conversion rates for each stage, highlighting the importance of the bump offer in boosting overall funnel economics. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So this is the. This is the simple funnel. We have a lead when someone comes in, because they they enter their details. In the box before they buy the book, and then they're showing the the order form and the upsell. We have a bump which increases the economics immediately inside the car. We then have an upsell and a downsell I know Chris runs more complex book funnels than this, and I have before, where I've had multiple upsells, multiple downsells, and everything. I am confident that with the structure you can get all the economics you need out of a book funnel up to a thousand bucks a day in ad spend. If you get, keep it simple and keep it right by swapping these things out. ## Book, Bump, Upsell, and Downsell Examples **Summary:** James Kemp provides specific examples of his book, bump offer, upsell, and downsell, emphasizing the importance of clear messaging and offering additional value at each stage. He highlights two effective bump offer strategies: behind-the-scenes walkthroughs and additional templates. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the book is this, and we I'm giving you all these templates, and most of you have seen the book funnel. But I'm gonna give you the individual components so we can reverse engineer them for you. So the book, it does what it says on the tin. I've got a book there that talks about the suffering consultant, and obviously what you get. the playbook for building a million dollar per year. Solo consultancy with 65 clients or less than 2 days a week. So I'm super explicit about what it is and who it's for, and the byline, because no one really knows what a sovereign consultant is until I introduce the idea. So the bump is a really important one. You get the bump right? And you're most of the way to solving the economics of this. So there's 2 bumps that have worked extremely well for me. There's a behind the scenes. Walkthrough. ## The First Upsell: A Key Signal of Client Intent **Summary:** The first upsell in a book funnel is crucial not only for boosting revenue but also as a strong indicator of a customer's likelihood of becoming a client. Those who invest in the upsell often demonstrate a higher level of commitment and desire for further assistance. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the 1st upsell is the is the big one. This upsells priced at 200 bucks. and it's a deep dive in terms of the concept and in terms of the contents of the book. So my 1st upsell is the 3 K code and the social code those bundled together

. Those who invest in the upsell often demonstrate a higher level of commitment and desire for further assistance. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the 1st upsell is the is the big one. This upsells priced at 200 bucks. and it's a deep dive in terms of the concept and in terms of the contents of the book. So my 1st upsell is the 3 K code and the social code those bundled together. If someone was to buy them, separately, as courses currently run for a thousand bucks, right? And I'm and I can. I'm giving it to them for 2 200 bucks. So there's not much more to say, apart from more of the same right. This is the the step by step, training or take, you, show you how to make a 3 k. Offer. Take it to 3 KA week, and then 3 KA day. And again, the social code which talks about, the social, the social posts that we make, and and and ultimately, how we set those up. ## The Downsell: Simplifying the Offer and Maintaining Intent **Summary:** The downsell should be a simplified version of the first upsell, often unbundling the offer to provide a more accessible entry point. This strategy captures those who are interested but not ready for the full upsell, while still maintaining a relatively high level of intent. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Break up the upsell. Just make your life easy. Right? So if the if the if the 1st upsell is a bundle of things. break up the bundle and just offer one of them. So I we we cut. We. We chop up the social code and the 3 K code and say, Hey, wait! We've got. I really want you to have this. I really, I really need you to have this. I'm going to do it for a hundred bucks. and that converts obviously at a slightly higher level than even the upsell. So the people who are going through that again have relatively high intent ## Chris Benetti on Upsells, Downsells, and Consumption Formats **Summary:** Chris Benetti explains the importance of offering different consumption formats in upsells and downsells. People learn and absorb information differently, so providing varied options, such as video courses or action guides, can significantly increase conversions. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I think you nailed a lot of the good points here. Just from a visitor perspective. from an upselling point of view. and people people different formats of consumption, they'll get a book. And a book is . we all know books are valuable there's no doubt about it. But how how tangible is it going to be for me to be able to, potentially, get a step by step, action guide to implementing some of the strategies, sure, there's going to be a level of that in a written format. But, I think the reason why James's upsells and downsells convert so well, I think it's it's it's over 20% combined, which, if we think about that as a as an average, that's a hundred $50 average between the 2, that's a fantastic add on to the average order, value. ## Completeness in Offers and the Value of Transparency **Summary:** Offers, including books and upsells, should be complete and provide genuine value without holding back key information. This builds trust with clients and demonstrates a commitment to their success, leading to higher quality client relationships. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** They do. And again, it's that idea of completeness. You can't hold back on this stuff. I don't think you can. I don't think you should hold back on any offer. But there there is

. This builds trust with clients and demonstrates a commitment to their success, leading to higher quality client relationships. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** They do. And again, it's that idea of completeness. You can't hold back on this stuff. I don't think you can. I don't think you should hold back on any offer. But there there is. There has to be a sense and a and a and a and a real outcome of them being able to do it without you right. And it is really tempting to hold back on some of this stuff. But because you're I want them to become a client. So I'm just gonna hold back on a little piece the best stuff, the stuff that just sells out the gates, day, one is a how to book with everything it needs off the back of it. And the type of clients you get from that value. Input, they value perspective. And they value time, compression because they know that you're not holding back on them to try and manipulate them into. Oh, he's held back the last step. So I need to. I need to buy that thing. And then there's some tension there. ## Selling Off the Title: Clarity and Binary Offers **Summary:** The title of your book should clearly and concisely convey its core message, allowing potential buyers to quickly determine its relevance. This "selling off the title" approach creates a binary offer: either the title resonates, and they engage, or it doesn't, and they move on. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So before I before I move on to the ads, because there's a lot of variables there. I want to talk about selling off the title. When you look at a book funnel, and when you look at the the work required to do them. It can be overwhelming, right? Oh, I need a lot of I need a lot of words. I need a lot of selling. I am the world's laziest man. and the concept that I always come to with products and offers is selling off the title right. If someone reads the title of the book. Then they get what it's about immediately. There is no abstraction, there is no vagueness. there is no, there's nothing left to say in that. The playbook for building a million dollar per year. Solo consultancy with 65 clients or less than 2 days a week. Right? It is binary right, and all the copy which is not copy is just words flows from there to handle the things that someone thinks about before they buy something. Right? ## Book Sales Page Structure: Addressing Common Questions **Summary:** The book sales page should expand on the title, addressing common questions potential buyers might have. This includes an origin story, current relevance, content overview, pricing, guarantee, and a clear call to action. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the idea I want you to think about is selling off the title that it is binary. The people who are interested are going to start reading the people who aren't interested and are going to be that's not for me. I want 75 clients, and I want to work 9 days a week, and I'm, bye. And that's okay. So selling off the title is that the the thing that you have in both an imagery because you've got the you've got the opportunity to have an imagery in a book cover. both in terms of the imagery and the words used. You sell off the title. It is super clear what it is. It may not be ultimately clear who it's for, necessarily. And they need some context for that. But it's super clear what it is, and they start to lean in

. So selling off the title is that the the thing that you have in both an imagery because you've got the you've got the opportunity to have an imagery in a book cover. both in terms of the imagery and the words used. You sell off the title. It is super clear what it is. It may not be ultimately clear who it's for, necessarily. And they need some context for that. But it's super clear what it is, and they start to lean in. ## Binary Offers and the Importance of Explicitness **Summary:** Effective offers, especially for books, should be binary and explicit, clearly stating what they are and who they are for. This approach allows potential buyers to quickly self-select, leading to higher conversion rates and more qualified leads. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** And I want you to see the cover of your book and the lead as as an offer. Come here or go away right? So when when we're getting in there, all we're doing is unpacking the common questions they have. How does this work? When do I get it? What's the guarantee? etc? Right? And then they click in. So it works because it's binary and so lead with the stuff. A book is not the time to be cute about your pieces, or the mechanisms, or vague in terms of how you present it. It works because it's there, and then everything cascades from that, because then they're getting to this page right if you haven't got them. And the central idea on the 1st page in the bump, this page doesn't work. and then the downsell doesn't work either. And then the experience doesn't work at all right. So think about selling off the title and and ultimately making it binary. ## Book Funnel Ads: New Book Angle and For-Sale Ads **Summary:** Two effective ad strategies for book funnels are the "new book" angle, leveraging the inherent appeal of novelty, and simple for-sale ads that clearly state the product and target audience. Combining these approaches can cater to a wider range of potential buyers. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So we're running currently 2 types of ads. There's there's a time based one. And these are converting it different ratios, because one's longer and one's just shorter and and more explicit. When you have a book out you can use the old thing of it's new, right? People things that are new because they're better than things that are old in people's minds. So words free words new are great things that you can put into your marketing because they are naturally attractive to people. So I've always run new book ads. Candidly, even when the book. Isn't that new? I still run new book ads because it's new to them, right?, I'm trading an ethical line there. But it's new. It's new to somebody. They've never seen it before. So it's new I'm trying to justify. ## Ad Creative and Copy Variations: Feeding the Algorithm **Summary:** Modern advertising algorithms require a large volume of creative and copy variations. Repurposing successful organic content can be an effective strategy for generating ad variations and feeding the algorithm's demand for fresh content. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So with algorithms and distribution these days, the big thing is as creative and copy variations. I keep promising them. I'm going to write some bang along form. I haven't quite hasn't quite come to me yet, but it will come to me where I'll I'll write my I write another one of my disruption ads, or something that you we can probably run for a couple of years. . I've got it in me somewhere. It's just buried in the subconscious right now. But the the balance between, a long form ad

. I keep promising them. I'm going to write some bang along form. I haven't quite hasn't quite come to me yet, but it will come to me where I'll I'll write my I write another one of my disruption ads, or something that you we can probably run for a couple of years. . I've got it in me somewhere. It's just buried in the subconscious right now. But the the balance between, a long form ad. and again use something that works organically. All my long form ads are variants of something that's worked organically on the platform that we put it on. So if you've had a great Facebook post, if you've had a great Linkedin post. If you've had something that's worked particularly well on Instagram that will work as an ad. ## Chris Benetti on Ad Simplicity and Avoiding Overcomplication **Summary:** Chris Benetti cautions against overcomplicating ads and funnels, advising to keep things simple and avoid getting bogged down in complex technical strategies. Focus on getting the core message out and generating clients. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I think there's opportunity to overcomplicate ads a lot, and especially if you start this. Okay, this whole thing. Right? Oh, yeah, definitely, yes. I would just say, be wary of the gurus who are technical ad people or technical funnel people, because they'll make you try to build a complicated system. And ultimately it's all gonna stop you from getting the shit out there and getting it done and getting clients from it. So, keep it simple is probably the biggest piece of feedback around ads that I've got. ## Book Funnels: DIY vs. Agency Management **Summary:** While DIY book funnel management is feasible up to a certain ad spend, scaling and optimizing for larger budgets often requires expert assistance. Investing in agency support can be beneficial for maximizing long-term returns and avoiding the complexities of high-spend ad campaigns. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Yeah, I before I move on to the client speed I really want you to take away today that a book isn't hard, right? What is hardest, scaling it. getting the economics right, feeding it with creative. And and those things I believe in terms of . Candidly, you can diy this up to a hundred, or, maybe a little bit more a day in terms of ad spend and find your feet and optimize it yourself past that, and to really turn it into a big asset. It's it's complicated because there's a lot of moving parts that you want to get right in the funnel, and there's a lot of moving parts that you get right in the ads. ## Converting Book Customers into Clients: Waitlists and Live Workshops **Summary:** Two effective strategies for converting book customers into clients are using waitlists, which automatically funnel customers into client programs, and hosting live workshops, which offer high conversion rates and opportunities for direct client pitches. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the final, you've got your book. You've got your funnel. You've got some ads up, and you've probably promoted organically as well. You've started talking about it. The 1st 4 months of the sovereign consultant was just me talking about it, and I sold 500 copies of the book just by signing up for the book. Right? The the key piece, and the piece of both. The other piece of experimentation is around converting those those book customers into clients. So I've done 2 things, and I'm gonna double down on one of these things. and discard the other just through experimentation. So the 1st one is putting them on a wait list. And if you want the wait list again, it's in the waitlist training in in the classroom

. Right? The the key piece, and the piece of both. The other piece of experimentation is around converting those those book customers into clients.

And if you want the wait list again, it's in the waitlist training in in the classroom. ## Live Workshops: A High-Leverage Path to Client Acquisition **Summary:** Live workshops are a highly effective method for converting customers to clients. They provide valuable content, increase time on brand, and offer a natural opportunity to pitch client programs. A converting live workshop can also become a standalone product, further increasing leverage. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I'm going to double down on live workshops for 2 reasons. A live workshop is a better product than a static course. So I'm gonna change my $200 upsell into a a course and a program and bonuses. But it's around a live workshop. and a live workshop is a much higher converting path from customers to clients right? We know around here that, people can easily get 10 to 40% of people who come to a workshop into their community or client program. If I was starting from scratch I would sell a live workshop in the funnel and get people who buy the book into that into that live workshop and ultimately pitch the client program from there. ## Book Funnel Templates, the Sovereign Book Club, and Done-For-You Services **Summary:** James Kemp offers funnel templates and announces the Sovereign Book Club, an 8-week program to help participants create, market, and launch their own book funnels. A done-for-you service is also available for those who prefer to outsource the process. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So 2 things left. We've got some swipes. Chris has put together way more than I asked him to. He's massively over delivered. We've got creative swipes. We got the copy swipes. and we've got the funnel template. This is the I'm not sure if you can see that this is the live book funnel that we're running on software consultant. So as you can see, it's done. 40 ish brand on the front end. This is the exact funnel that I've given you. So I've given you everything in this one. So it's got the sales page, the upsell, the downsell, the confirmation, and then we've included the wait list, and then we've included the delivery components of the of the different of the different upsells and downsells, so you can drop your upsell and downsell, and that delivery. ## The Sovereign Book Club: An 8-Week Book Funnel Creation Program **Summary:** The Sovereign Book Club offers an 8-week guided program for creating a book, developing upsells, building a funnel, and running paid ads. This program provides a structured approach to book funnel creation and launch, with personalized support and ad management.
