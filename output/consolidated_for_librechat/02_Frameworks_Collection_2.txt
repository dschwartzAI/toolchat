# simple Framework

## Overview

** James Kemp advocates for weekly pricing over monthly, highlighting its benefits in terms of increased sales, higher annual revenue, client flexibility, and reduced churn.

## Complete Framework

. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** Recurring revenue is a mirage. It only recurs in hindsight. Many in the coaching and consulting space believe they have recurring revenue businesses, but they have long-duration products on payment plans. This is a crucial distinction. The only real money is *now* money – cash in the bank. Upfront payments create a delivery liability. The 20k you accept for 12 months of work is a delivery obligation. Smart businesses balance assets and liabilities. Clients are assets, and we generate yield by delivering agreed value. To grow revenue, we grow the asset: increase clients, client value, or client lifetime. My definition of recurring revenue is revenue that showed up in the past. I'll show you revenue that has recurred. I'll take you into the future so you can build a model that generates recurring revenue when you look back. ## The Power of Weekly Pricing **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for weekly pricing over monthly, highlighting its benefits in terms of increased sales, higher annual revenue, client flexibility, and reduced churn. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** I've found weekly pricing superior to monthly. Objectively, it has a lower "now" number, increasing sales. It generates 8.5% more annually due to 13 four-week blocks in a year. Subjectively, it's more dynamic. Clients feel more flexibility with adding/removing products and payments. It's simpler to upsell, downsell, and minimize churn as investment decisions are more immediate. I cut churn by 80% when I implemented a community level at a lower price, as people downgraded rather than left completely. ## The Simple-Complex Stack for Recurring Revenue **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the simple-complex stack, a strategy for creating a series of offers that address the increasing complexity clients experience as they implement simple initial promises, ensuring continued client engagement and recurring revenue. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** If we make things simple for clients, our offer is simple to sell. But even simple processes are individually complex. I make it simple to create a $3,000 offer. The complexity comes in the execution. Some people sell immediately, others take months. We take people through a simple-complex axis. Simple: "I'll create a $3,000 offer with you." Complex: "How do I sell it?" Simple: "I'll create it for you (Fastlane)." Complex: "It's hard to make $3k/week consistently." Simple:

# productization Framework

## Overview

** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages.

## Complete Framework

> "Yeah, have access to all my trainings on a recurring basis,"
 and with nothing else there. What will that do? I don't know. Will it create a whole cohort of buyers? Yes, it will. What will those buyers do? We will see. What behaviors do they undertake? Do people buy my trainings, and then do a portion of those people then buy one-on-one hours over the top, so they skip out the group components? Possibly. Maybe that's happening at the moment where people are bundling together on their own by buying access to some of my content, but also buying one-on-one hours with me, and skipping over the group component that we have in the Syndicate. For them, that value equation is the most efficient at the relative price point. ## Unbundling for Client Empowerment and Flexibility **Summary:** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages. He emphasizes the importance of offering scalable products and being open to how clients choose to combine them, recognizing that different combinations will appeal to different individuals. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Unbundling allows our audience and our clients and our customers to access the value that they see fit, and as long as we are prepared to do it and prepared to offer it because it's scalable to us, then they can assemble that for us with low complexity. I don't have a preference for what 90% of people buy off me until I do have a preference in terms of, I can help advise them what's the best path to go in. So that means that by unbundling, I allow people to choose their own adventure and assemble things that I can't see. A training plus a one-on-one component would be highly valuable to one person, but highly risky for someone else because they wouldn't be able to extract the value fast enough relative to where they are. So it comes back to us being able to unbundle, and our clients being able to see the value equation and tip it in their favor. ## Addressing Client Objections and Diagnosing Value Equations **Summary:** James discusses how to handle client objections related to price by diagnosing their individual value equations. He emphasizes asking clients what they're trying to achieve rather than directly addressing their price concerns, as this provides valuable context for understanding their needs. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** As with any sales conversation, you're diagnosing their own value equation. So what do they say? What do they perceive value in? I've purposely avoided upselling and downselling because it's part of a sales process, whereas this is part of a productization process. What you're looking for is them to put the truth on the table as to where they perceive value. And then you've got the option to present how you would deliver against that value. I'll give you two real examples. When I launched the Circle, I said to two people, "You don't need it." One person said, 
> "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it."

# effective Framework - Complete Guide & acquisition Framework - Complete Guide

# effective Framework

## Overview

** Live workshops are a highly effective method for converting customers to clients.

## Complete Framework

. Right? The the key piece, and the piece of both. The other piece of experimentation is around converting those those book customers into clients. So I've done 2 things, and I'm gonna double down on one of these things. and discard the other just through experimentation. So the 1st one is putting them on a wait list. And if you want the wait list again, it's in the waitlist training in in the classroom. ## Live Workshops: A High-Leverage Path to Client Acquisition **Summary:** Live workshops are a highly effective method for converting customers to clients. They provide valuable content, increase time on brand, and offer a natural opportunity to pitch client programs. A converting live workshop can also become a standalone product, further increasing leverage. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I'm going to double down on live workshops for 2 reasons. A live workshop is a better product than a static course. So I'm gonna change my $200 upsell into a a course and a program and bonuses. But it's around a live workshop. and a live workshop is a much higher converting path from customers to clients right? We know around here that, people can easily get 10 to 40% of people who come to a workshop into their community or client program. If I was starting from scratch I would sell a live workshop in the funnel and get people who buy the book into that into that live workshop and ultimately pitch the client program from there. ## Book Funnel Templates, the Sovereign Book Club, and Done-For-You Services **Summary:** James Kemp offers funnel templates and announces the Sovereign Book Club, an 8-week program to help participants create, market, and launch their own book funnels. A done-for-you service is also available for those who prefer to outsource the process. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So 2 things left. We've got some swipes. Chris has put together way more than I asked him to. He's massively over delivered. We've got creative swipes. We got the copy swipes. and we've got the funnel template. This is the I'm not sure if you can see that this is the live book funnel that we're running on software consultant. So as you can see, it's done. 40 ish brand on the front end. This is the exact funnel that I've given you. So I've given you everything in this one. So it's got the sales page, the upsell, the downsell, the confirmation, and then we've included the wait list, and then we've included the delivery components of the of the different of the different upsells and downsells, so you can drop your upsell and downsell, and that delivery. ## The Sovereign Book Club: An 8-Week Book Funnel Creation Program **Summary:** The Sovereign Book Club offers an 8-week guided program for creating a book, developing upsells, building a funnel, and running paid ads. This program provides a structured approach to book funnel creation and launch, with personalized support and ad management.

# acquisition Framework

## Overview

The acquisition framework consists of ) Repeat what works, ) Expand your personal capacity.

## Complete Framework

They can easily double their ad spend while maintaining current KPI's and keeping a careful eye on the break point.
2) Repeat what works:
The largest single increase in their revenue was running a challenge. They have then worked to lift their acquisition system to maintain this level of growth. The paid acquisition has grown them last month as much as the challenge grew them previous. They tried some other events that didn't move the needle. Everything works but only a few strategies will work for you and your audience. Schedule, repeat and optimise those. Growth is 90% repetition and 10% innovation.
3) Expand your personal capacity:
A weird thing happens when you see growth that you previously dreamed of: It's achieved by a small number of actions. When you've hustled your way through the initial growth this is jarring. You feel like you should be 'doing' more. You start to tinker and lose site that there's a small number of activities you must do. I learned this the hard way myself. When you see rapid growth your leverage comes from becoming the person who can hold onto it. You can also find yourself thinking you're too good for the inner work. Focus, creation and expansion of your relational/emotional/physical/spiritual worlds is what grows you into the person who can maintain it. The growth was pointless without maintenance. Some have to go through this gain/loss cycle many times before they can hold it.
I didn't do any of this. They did.
I provide weekly perspective, experience and insight.
Help them see the important vs the pointless. Work is required.
Smart or hard is the choice.
If you want an offer that can achieve hyper growth you'll want to pick up The Offer Code.
Save $400 until Thursday.

# Clients Framework - Complete Guide & build Framework - Complete Guide

# Clients Framework

## Overview

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert.

## Complete Framework

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The DCM™
This system creates Leads and Customers.
You then engage with a customer to understand the intent and desire behind their action.
It creates a short term focus that is most likely to generate results over the shortest time period.
Efficiency.
It also captures those who do not display immediate intent so you can convert them into prospects via qualification/conversation or convert them into customers in the future.
The Daily Client Machine™
[There appears to be a diagram showing three connected boxes: "The Offer Code Template" -> "The Offer Code Product" -> "The Syndicate", with labels underneath: "Create A Lead" -> "Create A Customer" -> "Create A Client"]
Lead Flow vs Lead Conversion
A critical distinction in lead generation is flow vs conversion.
When people say they 'need more leads' my first goal is to determine whether they need more lead flow vs need more lead conversion.
Flow is the volume and conversion is the action.
The majority of people have a lead conversion bottleneck rather than a lead flow bottleneck.
You have enough leads, just no efficient way to convert them into customers and/or clients.
The most efficient way is to make an offer(s).. This allows the leads to self-select and demonstrate intent and narrows your focus to those who've demonstrated intent.
If you're not making enough sales yet have even a tiny audience that you're communicating with, focusing on lead conversion before lead flow will yield the highest results.
The Individual Components:

There are only two key components inside The Daily Client Machine, your Big Idea and your Customer Offer.
Armed with both you will get all the leads and customers you can handle.
The Big Idea
Illumination - Pain, Problem and Opportunity Unaware Offer: Lead Magnet Goal: Opt In
Customer Offer
Indoctrination - Pain and Problem Aware Offer: $50-$100 Digital Product Goal: Consumption and Implementation
The easiest way is to illustrate with an

Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it’s skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.
The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The Hybrid Offer™
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is ‘simple’, it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it’s easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.

# build Framework

## Overview

You help business owners build systems free up time so they can make more money.

## Complete Framework

. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate. If you, if you're writing, marketing and messaging organically, or if you move to ads and then add start working, it doesn't add to just amplification of good content. But good content is created from good messaging, which is, which is created from good office. James Kemp: So I need you to understand the sequence, because the sequence is what delays most people because they work front to back, whereas we were back to front. James Kemp: So let's get into the hybrid offer. James Kemp: So traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for durations. James Kemp: It's simple, but it's just easier than simple. That's why the majority use it right? So the hybrid addresses this by selling a rock across a range of prices and times with a single offer. James Kemp: Simplicity is having one offer. and you only need one offer. James Kemp: and there is a useful distinction between offers and products is really made. You need a lot of ways to make the offer. James Kemp: But you don't need many products, and you don't need many actual offers. So hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it. So we sign them up for an ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes and timelines along the duration. James Kemp: Before we get to that James Kemp: we've got to define. Why, people buy. And again, the more variables that you insert here, the longer it takes to get results. James Kemp: But there are 4 core reasons. People buy help James Kemp: to make more money to save money, to stay legal or live a better life. James Kemp:, and the majority of people that sit in the make more money all have a better life. buckets James Kemp: stay legal as compliance, and some of those and some of those are real blue oceans because people really need them., and save money is a different market altogether. But saving money can be a, a core benefit of people who often save people. Time James Kemp: you only solve for one core James Kemp: and all the other benefits that are are exactly that they are benefits. James Kemp: So there's a huge difference between these 2 businesses. You help business owners build systems free up time so they can make more money. You help business owners build systems to make more money, so they can have more time. James Kemp: Both businesses do the same thing. James Kemp: The functional things they do but are the same. Yet both companies will attract a very different type of customer. James Kemp: because one is seeking a better life. and it's in a different stage usually, and one is seeking more money. James Kemp: And if you offer both James Kemp: as your core benefit. Both you and your client will be confused. James Kemp: and we see this all the time. That direct, that getting away from the core and talking about all the benefits. James Kemp: confuses you and confuses the market. Right? So personally, I solve for making money. James Kemp: and the stem of that is from one of my core beliefs that true freedom is downstream from from financial freedom. James Kemp: So the core piece about me and my orientation towards the market is making money

# on Framework

## Overview

** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers.

## Complete Framework

The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."
 This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings. ## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles **Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened? Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them. Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week. Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed. Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days. It's sexy to the right person. Helping people get their first 500 or next 500. Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event. If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter. Small promises are easy to keep. Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this? A community connects them. You're building a network. What's in it for them? The first sale is to yourself. Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes. Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase? If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific. Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution? The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community. Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle. What happens? We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan. You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing. What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance. Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers. Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: 
> "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."

out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific.

## Overview

with a cash flow based funnel with a customer funnel complementing that we can generate cash every day and generate sales every day that feeds the whole system.

## Complete Framework

## Benefits of the Dual-Mode Funnel So the the 2.0 funnel, is a is a dual mode we are generating leads. And we're also generating customers that as we go along, they, we, we need to optimize them based on the market. How many people are coming through as leads? How many conversations are you generating? How many customers are we generating, and at what value, and what are they buying right? So the immediate result is the and the 2.0 funnel is you get leads, customers and clients every day. Right? You're also getting future buyers and new customers and new clients at a high velocity much higher than nurture based funnels. So cash flow grows as the funnel dials in allowing you to scale marketing, spend faster than a traditional funnel in a traditional funnel. You've got to put leads in the top, have conversations. Wait till you get the client out the other side to understand what's the cost per acquisition, etc, etc. with a cash flow based funnel with a customer funnel complementing that we can generate cash every day and generate sales every day that feeds the whole system. So I found with these type of funnels running them in conjunction, you can scale them quicker because you are getting cash on the daily basis rather than having to wait 7 or 14 or 30 days to get a client out the other side and the other major byproduct is my list that the growth of my email list is predominantly made up of buyers these days. Right? So as my email list grows, I have more and more buyers. If I have more and more buyers on my email list, I get a higher response when I make an offer, because I've already got people on the list who are buyers. So the slow, steady, but, appreciable, compounding effect which most good things come from that compounds. Today. When I make an offer, I get a much higher response rate than it was than if it was made up from purely leads. I would much rather have a smaller list made up of buyers and customers than a large list made up of people who have just opted into something, and I've got the permission to communicate with. So the the 2.0 funnel, is a is a dual mode we are generating leads. And we're also generating customers that as we go along, they, we, we need to optimize them based on the market. How many people are coming through as leads? How many conversations are you generating? How many customers are we generating, and at what value, and what are they buying right? So the immediate result is the and the 2.0 funnel is you get leads, customers and clients every day. Right? You're also getting future buyers and new customers and new clients at a high velocity much higher than nurture based funnels. So cash flow grows as the funnel dials in allowing you to scale marketing, spend faster than a traditional funnel in a traditional funnel. You've got to put leads in the top, have conversations.

# interesting Framework

## Overview

The interesting is a comprehensive framework for business transformation.

## Complete Framework

. I have 80% conversion rates. And without skipping a beat, hormo goes, oh my gosh, that's horrible. And the guy's really taking aback and he is, oh man, you charge way too little. And it was such a powerful moment seeing the penny drop for my client in such an abrupt way of, oh wow. Yeah. What am I doing? This is crazy. And I think that's a real, pricing. I, I have really strong thoughts on pricing 'cause I don't think you should charge a ton of money and make sales really hard and retention really hard. You're looking for a sweet spot. But on the flip side, it's when I had modern autonomy last year, I was charging, I want everyone to hear this. Listen. 'cause it's very, very powerful. I was charging 297 a month for this is, this is real for six support calls a week and unlimited one-to-one with a coach, 297 a month, cancel any time, right? We, we got people in, but it was a nightmare, not the right people. Then in August we stripped back from six calls a week to one call a week. And I, and we removed all one-to-one and we de we increased the price from 297 a month, cancel anytime to $150 a week with a 16 week commitment. No, it was a six month commitment. We sold more people in and we attracted way higher quality people with 80% less delivery. Then we went to 200 a week and it continued to sell and we got 30 clients at that price point in August. Completely automated. That was a huge, huge lesson for me. Sometimes this problem we have of not working with the, the right clients, clients with really, really high standards, low work ethic, not the great vibe. It's a reflection of price because you get what you settle for. Yeah. And at different price points and different goals, the friction levels will be opposite. Right? My $9 trial has a very different goal in terms of friction and filtering than working one with me one-to-one, right? Yep. And so the friction management at, if you've got multiple price points and multiple products or multiple at, at, at, it's related to how much proximity the person has, how much access, what commitments you're making. Yeah. So the, the, pricing is a filter. Yeah. Well, do this guy, this guy Dan Gogh on X? Yeah. So I think Vince is still on the call., he was telling me that he met Dan Gogh. Dan Gogh's a fitness coach, a health and fitness coach. And so he, he probably has an offer, I could probably guess the price point somewhere in the three to $6,000 range. And, but Vince was telling me he has a hundred thousand dollars offer And then he sold it. He sold a few of them. And there's, there's a really interesting framework pricing that I think sometimes it's really, really helpful to have a super expensive thing that number one might take more of the level of support than you, than you want to scale at capacity. And number two, value anchors everything else. someone reached out the other day, who's one of the top network marketers in the world who's become a really good friend of mine. And she was, can you help me build the IG funnel?, help me build it out, do some of it for me. And normally I would just be, this is, I would never do that, but she's really cool. And I was, maybe this would be interesting. So I was, okay, it's 36 K, right? Because I had to find a price that I was, I'd be willing to do it for this amount

# one Framework

## Overview

** This segment focuses on using workshops as a powerful tool for acquiring clients.

## Complete Framework

Guy: My offer is for project managers: 6-figure role, reduced stress. Is that enough to differentiate? Most people would take a little bit more stress for more money. Focus on the 6-figure PM job. Reduced stress is the next problem to solve. Every solution creates another problem. Ahmed: My community offer value drops after 4-5 months. Should I switch to a one-time payment and smaller weekly fee? Pricing is a proxy for value. Why don't you deliver more value? We have weekly trainings. I could teach more, but I'm running out of things to teach. Most businesses have the fundamentals. Bad businesses look for the new piece. Repackage the fundamentals. Give them old value in new ways. Maximize value, maintain/increase price. Khan: I'm launching a community offer in English: $50/week for calls and community, $150/week for implementation, $250/week for WhatsApp, $750/week for one-on-one. Too complicated? Launch the middle two tiers in a hybrid: $100 and $250. The $100 is an easy start point, the $250 allows for higher-level access. More creates confusion. Treat free members as leads. This is the founding offer. Stefan: I'm working on an offer for customer experience optimization. How do I get specific on the goal when outcomes are different? You choose the playground. The sovereign community offer ($3k to $3k/week) isn't relevant for a $13M/year client. Who's your first customer? A medical supplies business with high turnover, low staff, no digital expert. Currency can be time and energy. Installing one system saves 10 hours/week. What do they want? Demand and money are unlimited. What's the intersection? Sell to the demand that's already there. Adam: How many benefits can be added? All of them, but lead with the core. What if tier one is live a better life, tier two is making money? Too confusing. Tier two is faster, more access. How to get paid in full? Both ways work. For large discounts, don't mention it in the doc. For bonuses, pre-sell it. The $100/week is a strong enough lead. Put offer hypotheses in the community for feedback. Specificity is key. Train yourself to be specific, and it carries over to all communication. Things people can point at are footholds on your content. ## Workshops as a Client Acquisition Strategy **Summary:** This segment focuses on using workshops as a powerful tool for acquiring clients. James emphasizes creating workshops that deliver real value, focusing on client needs, and strategically making offers within the workshop context. Video Source:* 100Dollar Offers.txt **Content:** So when I am starting to think about a workshop, I'm always looking at what clients want. The reason I'm holding a workshop about workshops is that the market is in a low-trust place, and workshops are effective for building trust. The market has become cynical, and workshops are an antidote because they allow you to demonstrate value. Once we've got a concept of what clients need, we turn it into an offer. I make the distinction between products and offers. Products are something we do, an offer is something people engage with. So I package it up in a way that is attractive. $100 is a nice price point. Workshops are challenging if you're doing something brand new. They're not necessarily a place to test concepts, but they are a place to reframe, reiterate, reteach, and remind clients. We have fatigue, life gets in the way, people get off track. The best workshops reiterate, reteach, and remind, giving them a new frame. You need people to do shit. The people who do stuff for you are sick to death of being fat

# best Framework

## Overview

It was Sam Ovens was the best at helping people get started.

## Complete Framework

. I'll just come up with a new tactic. And that is good for the good people and terrible for the terrible people because you, you can't, you can't innovate. You can't innovate and outrun it fast enough 'cause the economics don't make sense. 'cause the tension has just got so expensive. Yep. Yeah. I think this is a huge lesson for everyone on this call. No matter your niche, no matter your offer. What I've observed in our pocket, in the market that I'm seeing playing out everywhere is the era of better is over. And the era of different is here. When we got started a few years ago, there were king kings and queens of the hill. It was undisputed. It was Sam Ovens was the best at helping people get started. And for a lot of people, he was the best at helping get people get to a hundred KA month. And it was hilarious., who, who here has ever created a $5,800 offer, right, James? Okay. So there's a, there's a, there's a handful of people here. The reason I ask that is because that was what Sam priced up level, and that was the price point he told everyone to price at, to get to a hundred KA month. And so when I first started in, in my coaching journey in 2020, with my own official program, the number one most common thing I saw over the next 18 months was everyone charged $5,800. In other words, there was a, there was a, a perceived best system, a best way of doing it. It was you ran ads to A VSL, you had a closer, you, you were optimizing for these really specific KPIs. And then you sold a $5,800 offer that was broken into six weeks with lifetime access and a call a week. It was this undisputed, for a lot of people, that was the only way, what we're seeing now, what I'm feeling more than ever is people really focusing on the values and vibes of the people they work with., I caught two minutes of Sam Oven's school video update the other day where they were talking about, everything happening in school. And I found this so funny. They said, yeah, we've changed the way that school games runs 'cause we were attracting way too many hustle bros. And I was, that's so funny that they're talking about that as a software company not going, oh, these guys were, doing something bad. It was, oh, they're not the people for us. And I was, A software company is saying that, that they're, yeah, of all the people that we would want to attract into curator community, we are not looking for the hustle bros. The probably the underlying theme is, they can go over to Wop or GHL, but what we're trying to cultivate here is different. And the encouragement for everyone on this call is this idea that the idea of best and better do not exist. This idea of an objective king, queen category, winner, it doesn't exist in our market. And so the more we try and play that game, the more we are guaranteed to lose. And every one of our markets, there's someone who makes more than us, been in the game longer, has more accolades, more client success stories. And the more you try to play that game, you will always find someone who's willing to outwork you out, sacrifice you let, has, has less morals than you, has less integrity than you when you commit to the different game. Oh, I'm no longer trying to be better than James. I'm trying to be damn Bolton all of a sudden abundance. I'm no longer trying to run an ad that's better than someone else's
