## Overview

The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.

## Complete Framework

Constructing Your Daily Client Machine
How To Generate Leads Hourly, Customers Daily and Clients Weekly
The Sequence - The Order of Events Matters
To hit $1m, it is critical we attack it in the right order.
The common approach is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it's to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it's skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.

4. Automate lead flow and Customer sales and stack recurring revenue that compounds
into $3k per day
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ to generate $3k 2. Customers to Clients™ to generate $3k a week and per day 3. The Daily Client Machine™to generate $3k per day recurring
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
The Sovereign Brand
Size does not matter.
There is no audience too small to get traction quickly.
Actually, the smaller the better in the beginning.
The myth of needing big followings and a huge track record are just that. Myths. Sold by people
who have big followings and gate keep via experience.
You need to have solved one problem once for yourself or someone else and know how to solve
it again.
Nothing more.
A brand is the thing people say about you when you're not there.
You live rent free in someone's head and they associate you with ideas and imagery.
The end point of a brand is to promote action.
When your brand consistently sells someone on ideas and imagery it is very easy to get them to
take action.
It's the natural next step.
The ideal brand does all the selling needed.
Then when an offer is made it's the natural next step.
Creating a brand like this is not easy but it is simple.
There's 3 components:

Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it’s skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.
The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The Hybrid Offer™
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is ‘simple’, it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it’s easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.

. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it. Then you need to decipher all those variables, and most people fail James Kemp: because they're being sold to by marketers whose default choice is marketing. James Kemp: and the best way to head a goal is not to work towards it is to work backwards from it James Kemp: because working fords is chaotic because there's so many potential variables, there's hundreds of ways to market and lot of them work. There's hundreds of ways to sell and a lot of them work. James Kemp: But working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage. James Kemp: because over a long enough time period and everybody's tried that we all have both approaches, get you to the goal, but working backwards, gets you there faster and with more certainty. James Kemp: So we're going to do 3 things James Kemp: we're going to create and validate a threek offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc. And that's what we're going to focus on today. James Kemp: We're going to create and sell a customer offer that converts 5% of its buyers into clients for you James Kemp: in that offer that we've just defined. James Kemp: Then we're going to automate the lead flow and the customer offer and Nsn. Customers into clients every week. James Kemp: So we go from making 3 K. And validating that to 3 KA week to 3 KA day. James Kemp: So we use 3 systems to do this. The hybrid offer James Kemp: which I'll talk about today, customers to clients and the daily client machine. James Kemp: The sequence is very, very, very, very important. because each of these systems solve for a specific stage. and we've got a master one before moving to the next one. James Kemp: and that's the right pace. James Kemp: Right? You may be at different stages, and everybody here is at different stages of the current offer of the marketing of the flow. James Kemp: But skipping steps is not speed. I constantly go back and reevaluate my offer based on feedback. James Kemp: One of the reasons that we use Google Docs is because it's dynamic, right? You can put it on the sales page. And those things later. Once you have something that converts at 30 to 40, James Kemp: but it's dynamic. I'm tweaking words. I'm tweaking, positioning all the time. James Kemp: so skipping steps is not speed. It sometimes feels it. I can just jump straight to marketing. I need more leads, so I can just jump jump to that. But it's just skipping steps. James Kemp: So mastery and the sequence compounds. The better your hybrid offer. The more clients you convert. the better your customers to client system, the more customers and clients you generate. and the better your daily client machine, the more leads turn into customers who turn into clients and and it compounds in action. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate

# Profitability Framework - Complete Guide

# Profitability Framework

## Overview

The Profitability framework consists of Math, Attention, Content Pillars, Engagement Hacks.

## Complete Framework

# DarkJK Sales & Marketing Mastery
## The Only Marketing Formula You Need **Audience × Offer × Copy = Results**
Miss any element and you get zero. Master all three and you print money.
## Audience: Finding Your People
### The Ideal Client Avatar Exercise Stop trying to sell to everyone. Define ONE person: - **Demographics**: Age, income, location, profession - **Psychographics**: Values, fears, desires, beliefs - **Behavioral**: Where they hang out, what they buy, who they follow - **Problem State**: What keeps them up at night? - **Dream State**: What does success look like to them?
### The 1000 True Fans Principle You don't need millions. You need 1000 people who: - Have the problem you solve - Have money to pay for the solution - Are actively looking for help - Trust you to deliver results
**Math**: 1000 fans × $1000/year = $1M business
## Offer: Creating Irresistible Products
### The Offer Stack Framework 1. **Core Result**: The main transformation 2. **Speed**: How fast they get results 3. **Ease**: How simple it is to implement 4. **Support**: How you'll help them succeed 5. **Risk Reversal**: Why they can't lose 6. **Bonuses**: Extra value that costs you little 7. **Scarcity**: Real reason to act now
### The Grand Slam Offer Checklist - [ ] Solves a painful problem - [ ] Delivers specific, measurable results - [ ] Works faster than alternatives - [ ] Requires less effort than DIY - [ ] Includes implementation support - [ ] Has strong guarantee - [ ] Priced based on value, not cost

### The Problem-Agitate-Solution Framework 1. **Problem**: Call out their current pain 2. **Agitate**: Dig into the consequences 3. **Solution**: Present your offer as the cure
## Sales Psychology
### The 7 Triggers of Influence 1. **Reciprocity**: Give value first 2. **Commitment**: Get micro-commitments 3. **Social Proof**: Show others' success 4. **Authority**: Demonstrate expertise 5. **Liking**: Be relatable and authentic 6. **Scarcity**: Limited time or quantity 7. **Unity**: Create an us-vs-them dynamic
### Objection Handling Matrix

**"I need to think about it"** - "What specifically do you need to think about?" - Address hidden concerns - Create urgency with bonuses - Set follow-up appointment now
**"I don't have time"** - Show how it saves time long-term - Highlight done-for-you elements - Share busy client success stories - Question their priorities

## The Sales Mindset
### Beliefs That Sell - Selling is serving - Rejection is redirection - Price is only an issue in the absence of value - The fortune is in the follow-up - Everyone is not your customer - No is closer to yes than maybe

# sovereign Framework

## Overview

** This session focuses on creating a community-based offer that generates $100k in revenue.

## Complete Framework

- ## Creating a $100k Community: Product and Offer Strategy **Summary:** This session focuses on creating a community-based offer that generates $100k in revenue. James Kemp emphasizes the importance of clear promises, actionable plans, and strategic pricing tiers to maximize both client acquisition and revenue generation. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Morning peeps. I need to take a stance on these otters and the rooms. You end up interacting with otters and AI pilots more than you do with humans. I've got a doc for you as usual. Bear with me on resolution. So, $100k community, today we're going to talk about product and offer. I want to direct us more towards doing in these things rather than, dare I say, mental masturbation. The philosophy is important, but that's consumed by the learning and the doing. Today is about product and offer, next week, validating it with the founding members frame. Week 3 is next steps. Even those with existing community offers could do with sharpening. Results are always relative. How fast you get results comes from what you already have, and what work you're about to do. Sales are a product of 3 factors: audience (60%), offer (30%), and copy (10%). The audience is a product of what you've done before. The offer is how clear, relevant, and timely it is. Clarity is what promises it makes, relevance is how relevant that promise is right now, and timing can leverage trends. Copy is just the words you use. A receptive audience and a clear offer will take you 90% of the way there quickly. Your offer is your offer, relational to your marketplace and audience. Why community? Four reasons: monetizing an audience (most of your audience hasn't bought from you), a home for your stuff (reduces decision fatigue), ascending clients (easy start point), and taking prospects off the market. Economics: our goal is $100k from a community. In the sovereign system, we have clients, customers, and leads. We get leads, turn them into customers, and turn customers into clients. Some people will pay 50 times more than others. Economics comes from paying in full for 12 months and clients signing into higher tiers. The path to $100k is unlikely to be 20 people at $100/week. It's likely to be a mix: some at $100/week, some paying $3k for 12 months upfront, and some at a higher tier ($300/week). If you have a big audience, a straight community level can work. But to maximize revenue, a higher tier is essential. A community has 3 components: content, the community itself, and customization. The simplest model is tier one ($100/week) with a training portal, community platform, and customization (group calls). Tier 2 is for those who want to go faster, including done-for-you components. If you have an existing high-ticket program, insert the community below it. The community offer is 12 months. ## Defining Your Core Offer and Crafting Compelling Promises **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of focusing on a single core benefit in your offer. James explains how to articulate the promise and plan of your offer to resonate with your target audience and drive conversions. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Four reasons people buy: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Everything outside the core reason is a benefit. I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. Your core piece stems from your own beliefs. While I say a lot of things, I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. As you get more experienced, you deliver more benefits

> "I want your support in getting offers pumping out cash without me having to crank the handle myself. Our goal is building a $3k offer that you take to $3k per week clockwork."
 The plan: 
> "We will install the sovereign system, talk about the client offer, customer offers, and then install the daily client machine."
 The promise, the plan, and the phases. This offer lives and dies on this page. Everything else is logistics. Price is relevant to value. $100/week. What's the risk? Weekly frame, come in, can leave. I choose no guarantees, promises, or refunds. Guarantees are a product of trust perception. The more track record you have, the less you need a guarantee. ## Maximizing Community Economics and the Hybrid Offer Approach **Summary:** James discusses strategies for maximizing community revenue, including offering annual payments with bonuses and utilizing the hybrid offer model to present multiple tiers without confusing potential clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We use the $100/week as a hook. Getting payment upfront is preferable. The average $100/week person stays 15-18 weeks, worth $1500-$1800. If we get $3000 upfront, we get cash upfront and they're more committed. I have a $3900 annual offer with a one-on-one call. This converts at 30%. To maximize conversions, I'd offer it at $2500-$3000. Offering $2500 annually is over a 50% discount. We use pricing to incentivize and collect cash. The hybrid offer sells the first tier without harming conversion to the client offer. 
> "You're receiving regular workshops and 24/7 access. Beyond that, have an option for my personal help. Members can upgrade or I can build you a custom plan to take an offer from $3k to $3k/week to $3k/day."
 The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."

# This Framework - Complete Guide

# This Framework

## Overview

** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model.

## Complete Framework

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The DCM™
This system creates Leads and Customers.
You then engage with a customer to understand the intent and desire behind their action.
It creates a short term focus that is most likely to generate results over the shortest time period.
Efficiency.
It also captures those who do not display immediate intent so you can convert them into prospects via qualification/conversation or convert them into customers in the future.
The Daily Client Machine™
[There appears to be a diagram showing three connected boxes: "The Offer Code Template" -> "The Offer Code Product" -> "The Syndicate", with labels underneath: "Create A Lead" -> "Create A Customer" -> "Create A Client"]
Lead Flow vs Lead Conversion
A critical distinction in lead generation is flow vs conversion.
When people say they 'need more leads' my first goal is to determine whether they need more lead flow vs need more lead conversion.
Flow is the volume and conversion is the action.
The majority of people have a lead conversion bottleneck rather than a lead flow bottleneck.
You have enough leads, just no efficient way to convert them into customers and/or clients.
The most efficient way is to make an offer(s).. This allows the leads to self-select and demonstrate intent and narrows your focus to those who've demonstrated intent.
If you're not making enough sales yet have even a tiny audience that you're communicating with, focusing on lead conversion before lead flow will yield the highest results.
The Individual Components:

There are only two key components inside The Daily Client Machine, your Big Idea and your Customer Offer.
Armed with both you will get all the leads and customers you can handle.
The Big Idea
Illumination - Pain, Problem and Opportunity Unaware Offer: Lead Magnet Goal: Opt In
Customer Offer
Indoctrination - Pain and Problem Aware Offer: $50-$100 Digital Product Goal: Consumption and Implementation
The easiest way is to illustrate with an

- ```txt ## Crafting a Compelling Offer **Summary:** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Welcome! Today, we'll focus on constructing your daily client machine—how to generate leads hourly, customers daily, and clients weekly. It's critical to attack things in the right order: offer, then sales, then marketing. The best way to hit a goal is to work backward from it. Create and validate an offer, make three sales with a Google Doc, create a customer offer that converts 5% of buyers into clients, and then automate lead flow, customer offers, and ascend customers into clients weekly. This system creates leads and customers, engages with customers to understand their intent, and captures those who don't display immediate intent for future conversion. The two key components are your big idea and your customer offer. The process is: lead magnet (capture and opt-in), customer offer ($100 digital product), and client offer. The big idea is a product of your client and customer offers, a frame that catches attention, creates curiosity, and establishes authority. ## Big Ideas and Customer Offers **Summary:** This chunk explores different frames for creating a big idea, including swiping, next steps, automation, and identity. It also discusses the customer offer and its role in converting leads. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Many big ideas become so successful they become the brand. Consider these frames: swiping (copy my success), next steps (your first client), automation (automatic clients), and identity (the sovereign consultant). Big ideas often have utility across multiple products (books, courses, consulting). My big idea, "selling from a Google Doc," led to a daily client machine that generates 5-10 leads daily and 1-2 product sales, doubling with simple ads. Put your big idea everywhere—social media profiles, ads. The customer offer turns leads into customers. Ideal components include training, templates, a live workshop, and a call. ## Offer Creation and Validation **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer creation, validation through market feedback, and the key principles of promise, process, and plan. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The path to a million-dollar business is simple, not easy: promise, process, mechanisms, plan, validation, sales, scale, automation. The hybrid offer is key, a single offer with multiple products. Four reasons people buy help: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Focus on one core reason; everything else is a benefit. Understand the problem/desire you're solving. Validation is getting your offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. Use the community for feedback based on real data. ## Hybrid Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk explains the hybrid offer, its advantages over traditional consulting, and provides specific pricing recommendations for community offers, consulting offers, and customer offers. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer, containing multiple products. It includes a 12-month ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Pricing examples: Community offers ($100-200/week, $3,000 annual), consulting offers ($300-600/week), customer offers ($100). This pricing maximizes conversions and economics, making it easy to get started and upgrade. ## Offer Construction Principles **Summary:** This chunk details the three core principles of offer construction: promise, process, and plan. It stresses the importance of clarity, future pacing, and avoiding information overload. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** Three principles: promise (what gets done), process (how it works), plan (how it rolls out)

# and Framework - Complete Guide

# and Framework

## Overview

** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers.

## Complete Framework

Phase Two we cashflow the offer with your audience and we’ll work to tap in these new clients.
I’ll leave you with an offer and system that you can run every single month.
You understand you are getting direct help in structuring offers and campaigns, retaining customers and clients, campaign triage (when things don’t go as planned) and other aspects of cash-flowing the offer to $10k.
What we do together:
Add at least $10k in cash re-working an existing offer or creating
something new and simple to deliver.
Offer Install Call with Me. We create the offers, campaigns, messages,
copy and strategy.
The Syndicate. A private community channel w/direct access to me via
message and calls.
Access to all my most up to date templates and strategies. 12 years of strategies. I will give you access to new strategies that are working in my businesses if it meets your specific goals.
Investment?
Your investment uses my Pay As You Profit model that means you keep the majority of the profits we create together
$5k now.
Then: $5k when we hit $10k of sales
I’ll even let you finance the initial $5k over 12 weeks @ $500 per week.
What do you need to bring?
You’re already selling a high ticket offer between $2k-$20k, probably via the phone, and you’ve only sold to 1-2% of your total audience.
You have an email list, Facebook group, Linkedin connections or Instagram followers with a couple of thousand people.

Want in?
Message me and I’ll get you setup.

Make it the best it can be and offer it to your leads.
Tomorrow those leads will be buyers and you'll both be further along than you were today.
I walk through exactly how to make offers in The Offer Code.
A couple of folks who bought a couple of days ago have already turned stuff they already had into offers and $$.
There's a live workshop I've included for anyone who picks up the Offer Code before Thursday.
It's $100.

James 'make more offers' Kemp
PS; Workshop is Thursday at 7am Singapore. Scheduled 2 hours but often go longer. Replay will be sent out 24 hours later.
Email 6:
One of my mentorship clients has grown their business revenue 70% in the past 15 weeks.
From £31k to £51k for two consecutive months.
80% of this revenue increase is from recurring revenue.
Their goal is £83k per month average or the 'magic million' per year.
Here's 3 insights I shared with them on Tuesday:
1) Spend more and grow faster:
They are getting front end leads for less than £2 with, chat's with qualified prospects for £14 and calls for £38. There's lots of slack in their KPI's. When something is working you identify the future failure point and then double down on the high leverage activity. The high leverage is cheap leads and the break point is their setting team and process.

. Russell Pearson: Yeah. And it's a so 21 total year. And if you're talking, maybe 100 or a hundred 50 a week. Russell Pearson: That's the community piece. James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: lots of people having great results unbundling their main programs that. James Kemp: So they, my recommendation would be offer them a one-on-one call as a bonus to get started, just I do James Kemp: have go. James Kemp: I'm running an experiment for 5 people on a founders offer who want access to all my James Kemp: all my trainings and a little bit of access to me, and one access to the amazing community and the for the first 5 people. It's a hundred bucks a week. James Kemp: because it's about driving velocity James Kemp: and ultimately driving more clients. James Kemp: And then you could raise it up to to be more., closer James Kemp: to 50% of what the current James Kemp: offers. This. Which is a good ratio. So you're at 1750. So that's about 3, 50, James Kemp: 3, 50 a week. James Kemp: So if you raise that up to 100 5,200 for the community only offer. James Kemp: then you get plenty of people upgrading to the to the forge. Russell Pearson: Yeah, cool and the and so is there any nuance or any mistakes that I could make by Russell Pearson:, I'm thinking, from the scaling point of view, by Russell Pearson: offering people at that lower price point where they just get in for lifetime value. Russell Pearson: I guess it's just the boundaries that you're talking about. Just don't go, allowing them into one on one stuff and outside of any specific office. James Kemp: Yeah, no, just don't make exceptions. James Kemp: which is the key piece to to client delivery businesses, which might be exceptions, but might themselves have to scale and stressful. James Kemp: And I, when you when you can approach the the nuance with the messaging would be James Kemp: very clear, it's 1,750 a month to work with me in the forge for that. You get lots of access to me. Lots of people just want access to my James Kemp: training and methodologies and a little bit of access and and and a community of support. If you're self-directed, then this might be for you. James Kemp: and then it's very clear that if I want more of you. I can just Russell Pearson: always 1 one. Yeah. Great fantastic. Appreciate that James Kemp: cool. James Kemp: Yeah, just to still it down., there's a number of programs going out there right now, 2,000, 402,500, James Kemp: and then offering, access to the community element. And and I'm bundling, and James Kemp: they're upgrading a ton of people right? Because that that easy weekly pricing makes it easy to get started to upgrade to the thing. James Kemp: And that's the Bolton. That's the Bolton approach. The community offer can be a lower, a lower level entry level on the 2 main program. James Kemp: Any more questions. Emily Utter: I have a question about what I'm including, cause I think maybe I didn't quite do it right. Not right. But what . James Kemp: Hmm. Emily Utter: but arcs. Hand is up, too. Emily Utter: Should I go ahead or wait? Got it? Emily Utter: Okay? So I wanted to do mine where I wasn't promising every single week, cause

The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."
 This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings. ## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles **Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened? Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them. Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week. Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed. Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days. It's sexy to the right person. Helping people get their first 500 or next 500. Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event. If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter. Small promises are easy to keep. Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this? A community connects them. You're building a network. What's in it for them? The first sale is to yourself. Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes. Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase? If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific. Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution? The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community. Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle. What happens? We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan. You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing. What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance. Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers. Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: 
> "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."

# or Framework

## Overview

** Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best.

## Complete Framework

. Sell an experience, not just features. Make the offer tangible by describing the physical experience of the desired outcome or the removal of the problem. Focus on selling relief—a better tomorrow—and make the offer a clear path to that relief. Tangibility and a clear vision make offers easy to sell. ## Offer Distinction and Positioning: Standing Out in Competitive Markets **Summary:** Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best. He advises using unique naming and framing the offer as an "install" to reduce the perception of labor. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** In competitive markets, distinction is key. If you can't be the best, be the easiest. Use unique naming and frame your offer as an "install," reducing the perception of labor. Develop a monopoly on your unique mechanism or process. Content builds context, establishing your expertise and making the offer a natural next step. ## Pricing for Conversions and Economics: The Path of Least Resistance **Summary:** Kemp advocates for pricing that maximizes conversions and economics, often meaning being among the cheapest but most accessible in the market. He advises against high pricing driven by ego and emphasizes the power of $100 offers. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** Price for maximum conversions and economics. Accessibility is key; often, the cheapest offers are the most effective. Avoid inflated pricing driven by ego or status seeking. There's a magic to $100 offers; they work exceptionally well. Focus on delivering value and earning the right to experiment with higher pricing later. ## The 6-Month Plan: Principles, Playbooks, and Client Ascension **Summary:** Kemp outlines a 6-month plan for building a sustainable, scalable business, focusing on the principles of market selection, offer creation, and client ascension. He introduces playbooks for execution and emphasizes the importance of volume and speed in skill development. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The plan involves selecting the right market, creating a compelling offer, and building an ecosystem for client ascension. Playbooks provide actionable steps. Volume and speed enhance skill development; the more you do, the faster you learn and improve. Focus on leveraged actions that compound over time. Everything works with enough volume and iteration. ## Managing Expectations and Pacing: Sustainable Growth and Reduced Volatility **Summary:** Kemp advises setting a sustainable pace and managing expectations, emphasizing the importance of slow, steady growth to reduce volatility and avoid burnout. He recommends using time as a variable and focusing on the process, not just the outcome. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Define a sustainable pace. Processes take time; reverse engineer from your goals and set a pace you can sustain. Manage expectations, especially around speed of return. Slow, steady growth reduces volatility and prevents burnout. Use time to your advantage; the slower you grow, the higher your revenue floor and the lower your volatility. ## Dynamic Offers and Client Lifetime Value: Maximizing Potential **Summary:** Kemp discusses maximizing client lifetime value by offering multiple tiers and crediting previous investments. He encourages open communication about different program levels and making upgrades and downgrades natural and tension-free. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Display different program levels early and often. Credit previous investments to encourage upgrades. This injects potential energy into the system and makes ascension conversations easier. Make it personal and work out custom payment plans based on credits. This approach maximizes client lifetime value and fosters long-term relationships. ## Addressing Client Questions and Objections: Handling "Not Now" **Summary:** Kemp advises addressing client questions directly and handling objections by taking the offer off the table, creating space for honest feedback. He emphasizes the value of a "not now" response and using it as an opportunity for further conversation

. the easier they are to convert into becoming a client, and the longer they stay in your world. . We've been talking a little bit over the last couple of weeks about content. my Youtube strategy and my video strategy. And that's about, brand Width, it's about getting people on brand and consuming one or some or all of the ideas that you have. So by the time that they're reaching out, or you're having a conversation about an offer. they are already sold on those things, and you are the origin of them. ## Books as Evergreen Assets and Client Generation Tools **Summary:** Books are highly evergreen marketing assets, remaining relevant and effective for years. They offer excellent value and can generate clients even without complex funnels, though distribution and economics are key for maximizing their potential. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So in the Internet space. And in in the online space the rate of change is super super high, things come and go and they fizzle out and they disappear really, really, quickly, and their effectiveness and a book is an interesting one, because as an asset, it's 1 of the most evergreen I can't think of an asset that's more evergreen than a book, really, because even a workshop or a webinar would need a that can, that they can feasibly run for years, they still need to be changed and refreshed and updated where there are plenty of examples of books that are 10 or even 15 years old that are still selling in the market today. ## Creating a Book: A Simpler Process Than You Think **Summary:** Creating a client-getting book is often simpler than anticipated, frequently achievable in a weekend or less by compiling existing materials. The most time-consuming aspect is editing for readability and usability. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So how do we create a book? It is a lot simpler than you think. The creation of all my books has been done in a weekend or less right because they were. They were compiled, and amalgamations of things that are already done honestly, that the most of the time spent on books is editing. So editing is just making it readable and making it usable. And once you've got a baseline down then most of the time is making it editable, making it readable and making it consumable. ## How-To Books and Mechanism Books: Delivering Results and Converting Clients **Summary:** How-to books that provide complete solutions are most effective for client conversion. Books focused on a single mechanism are also highly effective, especially for problem-oriented solutions. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So I I believe that the best books and I have found that the best books are how to books. They give everybody. They give somebody everything they need to ultimately fulfill on the idea. So they tell them. You tell them how to do the thing so they could spend $10 with you and do that, or they could spend a hundred grand with you, and, and get you to do it for them. So books that hold back create customers that will hold back on you. So if you leave out the secret ingredients or leave out the key thing out of the book. You will find that that book doesn't ultimately convert people books that give people everything in terms of the central idea and the central concepts., indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person. ## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism **Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop

., indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person. ## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism **Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So there's 2 types of books that we can create. The 1st one is the big idea. the one that completely sells them and if you want to get more context on the sovereign consultant and the pieces of how I assembled that watch the authority training in the classroom. but the big idea completely sells them on your whole vision, your whole world, who they who they can become what they need, what they need to do next, and and ultimately how they do it. The the why, what, how, so? The sovereign consultant is A is an example of a big idea book. It's a big idea that creates the idea of what a sovereign consultant is. what they need to do to do it, and how to do it. As they unpack the chapters. So, the the Big Idea book is more of the book than our book, slightly contradicting what I said before, but it's it's ultimately the the big idea. the second type of book which I'm confident that 80% of you have now is a book that's just about a single mechanism. ## From Trainings to Books: Leveraging Existing Content **Summary:** Existing training materials and workshops can be easily repurposed into books. Transcribing workshops and blending them with training documents provides a substantial base for a book, requiring primarily editing and structuring. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the sovereign consultant book is created from 4 trainings. So there's a software consultant the the simplest path to a million dollars profit a year. You can see that training. You can see that it's got a Google Doc attached to it. The hybrid offer customers to clients in the data client machine. So, as I said, I will create 3 more books based on those mechanisms. So I will have an interconnected world of books that that point to each other and cross reference each other. Because I've already got the baseline of those books. So what I did is, I created a training. I ran the workshop. I got the workshop transcribed, and then I blended the the original training Doc, because I do my trainings in in Google Docs. And I blended that with the transcript of the of the workshop. The average hour long workshop generates about 17 to 24,000 words depending on how fast you speak. That's a book right? There is editing required, but you can have something usable and drop it into drop it into those, and I'm going to give you the book and the outline, and in a more readable and raw format. ## Simplifying the Book Creation Process: Focusing on Client Acquisition **Summary:** Client-getting books should be viewed as enhanced lead magnets or condensed workshops, focusing on client acquisition rather than being complex literary works. This approach simplifies the process and allows for quicker client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** This is a lead magnet on steroids or a reduction of a workshop. Right? And again, most people here have done both of those things, and the book is the happy middle ground in terms of the asset that is created from those, and also an asset that ultimately we can put into something that's got bit better economics

## How to Apply

maximizes client lifetime value and fosters long-term relationships. ## Addressing Client Questions and Objections: Handling "Not Now" **Summary:** Kemp advises addressing client questions directly and handling objections by taking the offer off the table, creating space for honest feedback.
