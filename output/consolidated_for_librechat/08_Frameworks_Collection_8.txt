# your Framework - Complete Guide

# your Framework

## Overview

If you optimise pricing, you stand to both make multiples of your current revenue and have a higher caliber client and results.

## Complete Framework

Price Engineering
Pricing is an extensive topic that can be boiled down to a simple principle:
The lower the dollar figure we ask for today, the higher the volume achieved.
If you optimise pricing, you stand to both make multiples of your current revenue and have a higher caliber client and results.
There is no one size fits all with pricing.
Use my Office Hours to get specific help from me on your pricing.
In general; for coaching and consulting the smallest unit of time and money is the week.
Weekly pricing allows us to offer the lowest possible Now Number to a prospect.
It's easier to say yes to $300 now than $1200 now.
The Two Now Numbers to optimise for:
1. How much they pay today. 2. How much they save today.
Traditional example:
Coaching program: $1500 per month/$18k per year $17k for the year
Hybrid Program: $400 per week $17k for the year (save $3000)
When I have run these structures side by side with clients and partners, The Hybrid Offer outperforms the traditional structure by 2-3x in both conversions and cash collected.
And...having weekly recurring revenue is cashflow on steroids compared to the relative lumpiness of monthly billing.
Stacking Economics
Stacking a community with coaching, consulting and services on top just makes sense.

I use a combination of ongoing consulting, mentorship, one time consulting hours and in-person events.
1 in 3 community members buy some or all of these on joining or within the first 6

Offer Creation Using The 3 P's
These are 3 principles to get you started:
1/ Promise and Plan
The offer lives and dies on the first page. Actually, the first 3 paragraphs. Get these right and the offer sells itself.
Clearly articulating the Promise of what gets done and the Plan of how it rolls out allows the prospect to 'see' the future if they commit to buying.
This is distinct from the logistics of how and when the offer is delivered.
No one cares how many calls there are or how much coaching they get until they are committed to the result that the Promise and Plan describe.
Match this to the 'right' price and you are 80% there is having a high converting offer.
Promise
What gets done? ● What can you point at? ● Can you describe what they will see show up in their lives if they commit? ● Can you articulate in words their deepest desires better than they can? ● Bonus: What aren't they going to do and what negatives downsides are you helping the avoid?
Plan
What happens first? ● What happens next? ● What happens after that?

Have you painted a clear picture of how the next few days and weeks look like and what
they will see show up? (future pacing)
Clear beat's cute. Name and brand your systems but don't overdo it.
Price
● Have you made it easy to get started? ● Does your price factor in the cost of inaction?
Is there a clear ROI?
No one wants to watch 54 videos and attend 10 hours of calls a week.
Telling people whats IN it is more likely to kill demand than enhance it.
Examples:
The Syndicate Example
Offer conversion rate of 32% ● Average client value 121% above entry price ● Chosen to make no guarantees or promises
October 2023: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lbn2n_YYd8lPgYqvHqPoB-4p2UPkTk2ly8Q5t984c/edit?u sp=sharing
Stacking LTV
Offering upgrade options is the way to maximise revenue.
Offering TOO MANY upgrade options when presenting the offer will harm conversions.
To allow us to maximise revenue we must discern when to present them.
The checkout page is the first touch point after the offer doc.
You can add additional options that will get direct purchases, create enquiry and flag to the client that they can add additional services and access to you now or in the future.
PAYMENT
[Payment table showing:
Syndicate - $300 Weekly ($300 per week) - Quantity: 1 - Price: $300.00 ● Syndicate plus Private Slack Coaching $800 Weekly (Save $500) ($800 per week) - Quantity: 1 - Price: $800.00

What can you point at? ● Can you describe what they will see show up in their lives if they commit? ● Can you articulate in words their deepest desires better than they can? ● Bonus: What arent they going to do and what negatives downsides are you helping the avoid?
Plan
What happens first? ● What happens next? ● What happens after that? ● Have you painted a clear picture of how the next few days and weeks look like and what they will see show up? (future pacing)
Clear beat’s cute. Name and brand your systems but don’t overdo it.
Price
● Have you made it easy to get started? ● Does your price factor in the cost of inaction?
Is there a clear ROI?
No one wants to watch 54 videos and attend 10 hours of calls a week.
More offers fail because they are indigestible than lean.
Telling people whats IN it is more likely to kill demand than enhance it.
Examples:
Your next task is to construct an offer using a simple Google Doc.
We use a Google Doc as it is fast to create, share and modify.
It is most useful to demonstrate via examples:

Syndicate Member Example:
The Syndicate Example
Offer conversion rate of 32% ● Average client value 121% above entry price ● Chosen to make no guarantees or promises

The key is to have a product that allows for higher client value over and above the Community level.
Your community offer is 12 months.
We get into the nuance of how to sell this next but laying out a plan allows us to maximise lifetime value on a pathway that makes sense to the prospect.

Price

. so the only key James Kemp: is to have a product that allows for higher client value over and above the community level, because the community level is relatively constrained., we can make 100 to 150 to $200 a week in terms of total client value, and $3,000 a year if we're doing a pay and full option for that. So it's relatively constrained. So we must find those people to expand their economics. James Kemp: and the people who are higher up the power law ladder, who want to go faster. Some people just want one on one help and customization. James Kemp: The second piece with the product is, how long is it? James Kemp: Again, being prescriptive? Your community offer is 12 months. James Kemp: Okay, so we get to the nuance of how to sell this. But the plan allows us to maximize lifetime value on a path pathway that makes sense to the prospect. James Kemp: So that's the product piece. James Kemp: And a lot of people labor this and get caught up. And I need to include a lot of stuff James Kemp: most products James Kemp: die. James Kemp: Add indigestion they're just hard to consume, and there's too much stuff in them. And that's James Kemp: I've kept that simple on purpose, and that's the that's again, the part that people want to add complexity to, because they think they should include a lot of stuff. Or they look at other people, including a lot of stuff James Kemp: when all you need is content, community and customisation. James Kemp: So that's the product. And the offer is the wrapper around it. James Kemp: So the promise and the plan drive the offer. James Kemp: The offer lives and dies on the first page. And when we get to the Google Doc and some examples James Kemp: it desired, it lives and dies in the first 3 paragraphs. James Kemp: So if you get these right, the offer sells itself James Kemp: clearly, articulating the promise of what gets done, and the plan of how it rolls out allows people to see the future before they commit to buying. James Kemp: This is very distinct of the logistics of how and when everything is delivered what's in it. No one really cares how many calls there are, or how much coaching they get until they're committed to the result. James Kemp: Right? That is pure logistics, and many offers and products are just jammed up with all the stuff James Kemp: that's in them. James Kemp: So match this to the right price, and you are 80% there and having a high converting offer. James Kemp: One of the James Kemp: secrets that how I get fast results with people is distilling down into that first page of the offer. James Kemp: You have a great offer. James Kemp: and, up to 10 million dollars. Now the business is the offer. That is, the may drive a performance. So I'm distilling down the primary things that make a high performing profitable business. James Kemp: So James Kemp: what gets done? James Kemp: And again, this is a important exercise. James Kemp: What gets done? What can you point at? Can you describe what they will see? Show up in their lives if they commit to working with you? Can you articulate in words their deepest desires even better than they can? James Kemp: What aren't they going to do, and what negative downsides? Are you helping them avoid? James Kemp: So what's the plan? What happens first? What happens next? What happens after that? James Kemp: Have you painted a clear picture James Kemp: of how the next few days and weeks look, and what they will see show up. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems

. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems. But don't go over the top. James Kemp: and with pricing is there a clear roi? Have you made it easy to get started? And I've done that by giving you the prescriptions of the pricing? James Kemp: And does your price factor in the cost of inaction? Have you just made it really easy to get started as the primary model? And again. this. I'm laboring this because it's a massive failure point. James Kemp: No one wants to watch 54 videos and intend 10 h of calls a week the better the client, and, the more money they have, the less time they have James Kemp: right, because more offers fail because they are indigestible rather than Lane James Kemp: telling people what's in it., all the things they get is more likely to kill demand than enhance it. Again, it's a common failure point that I see in products and offers that people are talking about all the stuff they get. James Kemp: and in and a desire to overwhelm them with value. James Kemp: And it's lazy, because if you have a clear promise and a plan, people don't need to know all the value you you deliver, they just need to get, be clear about it, so they can say yes and get started. James Kemp: So is to get some examples to bring these things together. Your next task is to construct an offer using a simple Google Doc James Kemp: syndicate folks, 95% of you should have one right now. So the reason we use a Google Doc as far as it's fast to create James Kemp: and to share and to modify. And it's most useful to demonstrate James Kemp: by examples. And I've got a template for you here as well. James Kemp: so this is an example from Jason and Janine. James Kemp: and it talks clearly about the promise James Kemp: and the plan. So the promise is. James Kemp: do you want support for me, and my incredible, incredible community can install a system that can can James Kemp: consistently attracts 5 prospects every month, securing at least one high value client every single month on your terms with the visibility you deserve, and without becoming stuck in the frustration of being the best kept secret. James Kemp: so clearly, clearly, clearly articulates what happens right? It uses numbers. It uses currency to clearly say. James Kemp: this is what's going to happen. This is what you get, and these are things you can point at James Kemp: it clearly, says that it's a 12 month program. but then it comes into over the next 6 weeks. James Kemp: and it talks about the plan will develop your client roadmap so you can. So you are faster. James Kemp: So your laser focused on who you work with. And more importantly, they'll want to work with you right? James Kemp: Then we install your product roadmap James Kemp: very clear. No cuteness. Just the client roadmap, the product roadmap, and then the IP generator system. James Kemp: So it's a great example James Kemp: of being very, very clear about the promise and the plan. and again distilling it down and removing any superfluous bits around the core. Right? Everything else in there is a benefit James Kemp: but the core James Kemp: clearly clearly articulated in the promise as something desirable, and the plan that future paces people to go through. James Kemp: This is what sales offers. James Kemp: If someone is clear that those are the things they want, and they agree with the plan. James Kemp: they are very, very, very likely to want to get started when the price meets the expectation. James Kemp: and again the pricing I've given you, will meet the expectation

. Right? James Kemp: The currency is money. the way I do it is unique to me. James Kemp: Emily's currency is money, the way she does it is unique to her. James Kemp: Your currency is money. the way you do it is unique to you. James Kemp: So you're encapsulating. But the core people. There. James Kemp: you're encapsulating the how. James Kemp: in terms of a differentiation, if you . Gieo: In that. Yeah. Gieo: I see. Okay, to build James Kemp: our goal is a million dollar health consulting practice. James Kemp: or our goal is building a million dollar lifestyle health practitioner with 100 clients or less or 10 HA week on the tools or whatever it is. Right? Gieo: Yeah, yeah. Gieo: it is in less and less time, more money and less time. Gieo: So yeah, that makes a lot of sense what you just pointed out there. Gieo: And he, he II think it's always a nuance to our, to our audience as well, because II certainly use., your framework, which was super helpful. Santa saved a huge amount of time. Gieo: And of course I changed the wording because pumping out cash. I don't. That's not the way that my people say it. I don't think it made me think that. So I change. Gieo: the nuance of what they want in in my, in my community, I said, everybody wants money, but but in my community, I think people want time more than anything, more more time, freedom. James Kemp: Yeah, the the core. James Kemp: People say they want more. People say they want more time, but they want money. James Kemp: So they because they think they can buy it. Gieo: Okay. James Kemp: So if you default to more money Gieo: and the methodology gives them more money in less time. James Kemp: Then it's a it's a safer default. Bet that the market accepts. Gieo: Yeah. Gieo: Oh, good. Well, thank you. Thanks for the feedback. And I said, I have Gieo: obviously been working with you for a bit, and got so much value out of this, and I hear something a little bit different each time. And and of course, as I'm building my own content and everything. So this whole piece about what is the core offer. II think there, I think there's layers of meaning in it. James Kemp: And there's la, there's always laser, meaning everything. And I'm, and I'm being overly simplistic today on purpose. James Kemp: because you can obfuscate all of these things James Kemp: and call it nuance right. But when we get to the core of the reason for the offer existing, and you being oriented towards the market, there's layers and layers of why you won't do that. Well, you can't do that. James Kemp: But the core pieces. What are you in the business of? James Kemp: And then adding your own unique. Spin to it. Gieo: Yeah. Gieo: Well, the the thing that I'll say to you before I jump off here, is that the other piece Gieo: just to affirm and confirm Gieo: is the commitment, so I will do what was prescribed, and I recommend other people do as well. So I will put an offer out to at least 10 people, probably a bunch more. Gieo: And I'll I'll report back. James Kemp: Yeah. Got some sales last week? Right? So you're you've got your James Kemp: thank you, sir

that doesn't exist yet for someone and then allowing them to be Rel make it relevant to themselves so the the the low level the the surface level is is selling money the secondary level is is is selling time to some degree and the infinite game is is is is being in in the market to sell energy and then using the modalities that we have to to do that and in terms of service and delivery there's there's only really four and you just mix those modalities based on your Skool set four modalities to sell energy you mean four modal to serve so we've got coaching Consulting mentorship and Service delivery right and Service delivery is just I'll do this thing for you and it it is nothing else I I'll do this thing for you I will spend $110,000 a month on Facebook ads for you to this funnel and this will happen you will have leads in your calendar and you call them on the telephone right yeah and it and it ends there we wrap a lot of stuff around it but service delivery is just doing something for somebody mentorship mentorship is this is how I would do it so my high level mentorship is people asking me how I think about things and how I've done things in the past that have got success that they want to replicate and I say this is how I do it this is how I think about it Consulting is telling people how to do something and then in the modern pance of consult Consulting is it's doing it with them so your traces of knowledge are left after you stop Consulting your system your ideas your philosophy is left there because you've done it with them and it's been embedded in the in the business got it and coaching has helped someone see that they've already got the things inside them to do the required action help someone see and give them Insight enough to get them to do the thing that they need to do that they're telling you that that we ultimately move them forward and we switch between those modalities naturally a lot of agencies do a ton of Consulting but they don't get paid for it and that's a gigantic opportunity for almost every agency to have a Consulting level in their business that just does Consulting and monetizes it because it's very high margin and high value work and business and so people are unconsciously do change between those modalities when they they're being a coach or even being an agency owner or being a consultant but those modalities when you understand the the what they are and how to deploy them that it opens up a world of opportunity about how you can use them either as individual products sell them as individual products but also serve people better in that time you've been on my on my group calls with folks and I and I ask permission to consult to them if I've got time and space I'll coach someone because that will leave the longest lasting Legacy because they they'll be able to do it themselves if we don't have time and they and they're floundering around as can I just consult you and tell you the answer and you going and do it and 99 times out of 100 they say yes right because they're looking to they're looking for the the life raft out of it but when you use these modalities you can serve people a lot better but in the process of that you serve yourself a lot better you serve yourself a lot better is that what you said yeah because Serving yourself you're because why why are you serving yourself better with those modalities because you're setting the correct expectations and life and a and a and a human world is about expectations and if you don't if you if you coach someone to do something but you're telling them what they want and what to do and you think you're coaching them but you're Consulting to them you're setting an expectation that this thing is going to be right for them rather than allowing to discover it themselves and that will Downstream have an effect on their application of that piece their their their results from it and ultimately their desire to continue it

# that Framework - Complete Guide

# that Framework

## Overview

That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you.

## Complete Framework

## The Dual-Mode Funnel Concept And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, download a lead magnet, and, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, people, are always looking for the best funnel. And, one of my most annoying phrases is, everything works right but who it's for? And when are the other determinants? And searching for the best funnel is is one of those endless ones when the constraints are predetermined. So the traditional lead generation of get a lead nurture, nurture, nurture. Watch people drop off and get a client works. It still works. but it's hard to scale. It's expensive. You need to be very good. And and ultimately it's not going to work forever. So something I've been working on for the past couple of months is bringing the 2 distinct approaches together. So dual mode client generation is a singular idea, deployed in in the same funnel with 2 different funnel types. So what we really want is clients, right? We can use those who won't immediately become clients to fund our marketing to get clients. That's the I think it's a little bit of a black pill. That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you . There are lots of people who are going to buy low ticket products from you, and will never become a client, but they'll give you cash flow to go and find clients right? So what we really want is clients. And what we really want is that the efficient way to do that? So this funnel monetizes IP that we've already got, we can use those who who won't immediately become clients to fund the acquisition of them, and we shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness of prospects. And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, download a lead magnet, and, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, people, are always looking for the best funnel. And, one of my most annoying phrases is, everything works right but who it's for? And when are the other determinants?

Watch people drop off and get a client works. It still works. but it's hard to scale. It's expensive. You need to be very good. And and ultimately it's not going to work forever. So something I've been working on for the past couple of months is bringing the 2 distinct approaches together.

There are lots of people who are going to buy low ticket products from you, and will never become a client, but they'll give you cash flow to go and find clients right? So what we really want is clients

## Q&A: Funnel Implementation & Testing julie williams: Hi, Jack, can I jump in here? Yeah, thanks. Yeah. I'm about to listen. I'm just wondering. The back end of all this that you're doing is that in go high level under workflows. James Kemp: The the funnel templates are there, but they're all high level pages. They're all. julie williams: Yeah, because I'm working with upwork at the moment on getting out a nurture or a workflow in go high level. So we've got similar to. One offer is to book a call. No one ever books a call, and they don't know you. So from there it then jumps to. I've got a 12 page. Report that outlines what I do with a call to action on the end of that. If they don't, if they take that 12 page report. They still don't do anything. It flips then to the next section of A. My ultimate initial offering is to book in for a 6 week fast track of my bigger 16 week mastermind program. So that's ultimately where I want them to end up. And then I've got a what else have I got? I've got something else in there, if they don't do that. So we're just trying to work them through to take up some offer in that process in go high level, and it's about to be launched into some people I've mined in Linkedin. But I'm just wondering with this. DM. 2 that you do it? Is it? Is that what you called it? Hang on a minute. Yeah. Number 2. Cause I did your 3 K code way back. What is the difference between a nurture campaign or a workflow and your new? This new thing? Can you make it a bit clearer for me? So I don't really understand it. What the difference is, and am I on the right track? Do. James Kemp: I'm not here. I'm not here to, educate you on that distinction. If you if you're in motion with something, then it will be a mistake to switch it without testing it. So if you've got that funnel ready to go, put a hundred people through it. julie williams: But a hundred only I've got about 1,500 at the moment we've accumulated, but I haven't done anything with them at this point, so I'm just a bit unsure. What's gonna happen there? But why, only a hundred. James Kemp: Just to get some confidence. What happens when a hundred people go through? Yeah, often reflects what happens when a thousand people go through. julie williams: Right. So he's saying. James Kemp: Then what your level of commitment and investment to it., if a hundred people go through and do nothing, you need to change something. 100 people go through and do something. . 5 of them do something. Then you put it in front of a thousand. James Kemp: Then what your level of commitment and investment to it., if a hundred people go through and do nothing, you need to change something. 100 people go through and do something. . 5 of them do something. Then you put it in front of a thousand. julie williams: Hmm, yeah, right? So continue on the path. I'm going with the workflow. Test it out. But then, how does this fit in here? James Kemp: It's. julie williams: This is more about Vsls. James Kemp: For you right now, Julie. you're you're doing something. This isn't about getting in. I should have. I should have said that caveat at the top

. So I know how challenging it is. So I wanna honor that Guys. Shout out Janine, that's amazing., I want to shout out this guy who just joined an inner circle, a couple weeks ago. His name is Teo. He's on this call., by the way, if you guys can't do video, totally get it. If you're driving, please don't crash. But if you're just being antisocial, I invite you to turn your cameras on., as I promise you, it will be a more electric call if we, if James and I don't feel we're just talking to ourselves., so Teo, came to the Mexico intensive. So every intensive I run, it's free for clients. And, we have guests come in and Teo messaged me. He signed up. We had a very, very short back and forth, and I really couldn't catch his vibe at all. And little did I know he was, natively Spanish speaker, English, second language. And I was, trying to figure out, who is this guy? And so anyway, he comes to the event and he tells me that he bought a hundred dollars product that I have called Inbox Income. The next month he made $40,000 replicating that, that system in the Spanish market. And then he signed up for Inner Circle. And I was, firstly, this is the most nonlinear way to become a client., normally you don't get results that from a hundred dollars thing, and then you don't come to an event first. But I was just blown away because Teo is 18 years old and his business partner is at the ripe old age of 19. And it was just so crazy to see these two amazing humans in Mexico doing work. Not just learning funnel stuff that's accessible for anyone now, but doing really meaningful work around leadership in, in a game, at 18 and 19., I was barely, I'd barely stopped playing with Lego at 18. And so to see where they are now was unbelievable., so shout out Teo and shout out Janine., there's a bunch of wins in here., Ian landed two figure, two, seven figure earners, not two figure earners. I guess that would be they made a dollar or $10, from cold traffic. YouTube. That's amazing. Justin sold six memberships in his group., two workshop tickets. Client made her first dollar ever online. That's epic. The first dollar man, dude, I'm telling you, the first dollar is harder than the, than the first 10,000., that's epic. Jared got 80 downloads of his book in last week after five rounds of testing landing page clients winning team worked with last year. And built foundations are undefeated. Kyla got six new clients in the last two weeks with a new offer. That's epic. My man Ray, just had a client able to contribute to their retirement for the first time since starting their business. That's, that's meaningful, dude. That's amazing., Elizabeth Benny, clients are freaking transforming. Big tears are transformational all around making money, marriages, repairing clients, setting up for themselves. That's very, very cool., there's a whole bunch more here, but that is, Caroline got seven returning clients to a new program. Absolutely Epic., Zach Sson, I do not know you, but I see your face all over my feed. So great to see you on this. Great to see you on this call., well, James, let's get into this kind of raw messy format that we, we've obviously perfected after one previous call, this, but, I think we'll be, We're gonna run a workshop on, on messy Catchups. Totally. This is, you guys have all been auto deducted another a hundred dollars. We've auto, we've auto deducted your credit cards

. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever. And then we'll just reach James Kemp: the limitations, but would also be missing out on a ton of people who bought in a different way. James Kemp: And also we would buy, we could run, lead, lead funnels and those things all day long. James Kemp: but would also be missing out on the people who buy via an infopath and buy products and consume them, etc. Etc. And that's their buying style. Shevaune Ray: Chat too. James Kemp: And the I'm looking for things sustainable. I don't want to be building a new funnel. James Kemp: . I don't want to be building a new funnel every year. I want the core laid down, and then just reframing it, and modifying it as it goes along, rather than . Oh, my God! The webinars, died after 6 months, or the lead magnet stopped working after 3. James Kemp: That's exhausting for most people. So we need a, we need a methodology and a philosophy that's got utility. We can add different. James Kemp: We can change the video. We can change the frontier product. But. Shevaune Ray: And that's I do appreciate that. I know. I I told you that I just switched over to go high level and I appreciate that about that system is that you can set it up with multiple entry points, and all you have to change is the workflow. Instead of rewriting the whole thing. If you just want to switch something out. James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah., once, once the James Kemp: once we've got the especially the info funnel working, it's, okay, let's put some more offers on the front because the bumps the same, the membership offers the same, the upsells the same. So you're just changing out the front end. And, products, fatigue markets, fatigue, things change, and on an increasingly. James Kemp: quick basis, right? And James Kemp: AI, and these things will accelerate that because people feel that they've got much deeper, information inside than they probably necessarily have, so they'll make very good products. James Kemp: But because people are buying them, and that's proven and gpts. And these things the people who are selling them are doing very well. James Kemp: but also they're on the back end. They're tough to convert, because you've you've given every everybody, everything they needed. James Kemp: And you've you've got true cannibalization. So yeah, it's the. Shevaune Ray: Are you going to talk more about? Shevaune Ray: Were you gonna talk more about AI in this meeting? James Kemp: Not today. Shevaune Ray: Not today. That was the other call, okay? Shevaune Ray: yeah. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed

[ __ ] out of me speaking gigs and those things which in hindsight was a great move yeah because when I wanted to leave Consulting and those things were not not a problem right because I built a profile and built a reputation and a 100 million dollar business yeah and I think around that time I imagine you probably didn't have the scarcity that kicks in when you then start charging for your information because when you start charging for information you're well if I'm charging for it over here and I give it away over here it must devalue the thing that people are buying yeah but you didn't have that you just had the I'm in the trenches doing it I'm just going to share it because that means no less for me if the thing that I'm doing yeah yeah and it means I don't have the struggle story of when I started Consulting as well right my first monthly invoice 40 Grand yeah perfect because I was mentored by senior people who were you go into companies you tell them what to do you hope they listen and they pay your invoices every month yeah so was it so the Consulting Journey because that sounds it evolved really naturally you became really good in your industry you got head hunted from UK to New Zealand you Rose up the ranks there and then did that Consulting naturally go to in-person consultation where you're working with a team in person it's it's more corporate c-suite type stuff yeah corporate where I had a reputation as someone who was really comfortable sitting in a boardroom and talking the talk commercially right but also getting down on the trenches right because I'd worked in startups you had to be that you had to know how to run a Facebook ad yeah because there wasn't always someone there to do it but you also knew had to know how to talk about a 10 million budget yeah right so the two different skill sets in the end of the spectrum so I was quite used filters when some companies were going into the scrappy incubator stage we're going to start up lots of internal tests and start businesses inside where I go along and talk to them in corporate speak but also startup speak because they knew that I'd be happy to get my hand to roll my sleeves up and do stuff and so when you think back to that period was that a seamless transition was that something that came with reservations or fears there was any sense of imposter syndrome because I know working with people in the online space and it's different when you go from I'm using my Facebook for friends and family and then all of a sudden I'm a business coach and there's that element but going from being the person who got had a job was paying to do it to now teaching other people was there things you had to overcome was there a story you had to unravel what was that process for you to get started the biggest thing the biggest thing for me was a discipline of it because the work was so easy that I had to learn lots of things to Pat it out you know so there was a discipline of it of is this am I doing the right thing am I doing the right am I doing the right job because lots of people wouldn't even listen to the advice that I was giving them yeah right so then you start to have the moral questions around it but I I had the easiest start to Consulting ever because I consulted back to the company that I that I was formerly a marketing director right so it's struggle to get your first client we just signed the people you used to work with and then start adding clients from there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for four months too long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would walk me through it and something about the weekly coaching sessions that's a a relic of of old we've been together for an hour I drive to you you

there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for four months too long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would walk me through it and something about the weekly coaching sessions that's a a relic of of old we've been together for an hour I drive to you you drive to me we do it on Zoom whatever and making the decision you want to make but are too scared to make it yeah and seeking permission in some other way yeah so the big fear was leaving my first client but that's when I'm met a young Sam Evans young saying moments I love it all Circle back to him in a second because obviously he played a crucial role for both he did yeah but with you in the role that you're in then being able to consult yeah it sounds it's nice for you James but I have to you know get clients and I don't have that but also for you I imagine there was years behind the scenes you're kind of skimming over the fact that I imagine there was a lot of really deep skill set building throughout that time it wasn't just right place right time I could talk the talk I imagine there was the hours of podcasts the blogs the whatever it might be what did that process of building the skill set so the company that you worked for they still had to see enough value in what you did to want to pay you the money that you charged what was that process to build that skill set at work right I I developed a deep skill set across sales and marketing specifically by doing it yeah right in the in the train it's had Blue Chip sales Vodafone BMW and Xerox sales training which is Xerox sales training in Europe is considered to be the best sales training on earth right relationship building and those things from corporate Enterprise all the way down to selling phones in a shop yeah a Vodafone when I worked in there in New Zealand when I was a student and it's getting the skills on the and but also and I think I'm more ruthless about these days it's focusing on what you're good at because there's so much idealism around skill acquisition because everything's a skill yeah and it's and it's really okay double down on what you're good at and largely ignore the bits that you that you aren't and that's a tough lesson to learn I was a terrible people manager right and I inherited these teams and I didn't know what didn't know how to manage I'm gonna run ads guys it's going to be awesome yeah but I'd lean in on the commercials on the marketing on the detail of those things yeah and go back to them and the results will always take take you through you don't have to be the easiest person to work with yeah you don't even have to be liked but if you're effective you can go a really long way right so I think I always focused on things I was effective at and avoid it out of probably internal fear all the things I was I was I was proving to be bad at yeah which I think is also underrated I think too many people try to generalize too fast yeah I've shamed myself horribly for that over the years of no I should build a team yeah I should be a good manager I should be this I should be there and it doesn't matter how hard you wish for it if there's no true genuine desire there yeah it's very difficult to acquire skills when you don't have desire behind them yeah it's very difficult to wear I really want to be good at this and I need to be good at this when there's no actual want deep inside you to want to do it well well I think we'll come back to this but this idea that business needs to be hard is a really prevalent one because I think business is already hard because we have to grow and gain

. so he's based in New Zealand Consulting is is a side hustle and you get into this Dropbox community of there's some trainings there's no Consulting accelerator that many people would have experienced later yeah and what was that experience because because at this point I imagine you're still Consulting in person I was still Consulting in person and we moved to waiheke island off Auckland and so I was starting commuting and I was I've got a job again I've got a flipping job again right and because it was single source of income have to get up have to go to a place have to stay there have to come back and hop on a boat to get to Auckland boat yeah wait if anyone who doesn't know waiheke island is not connected via a bridge it's a 45 year 35 yes 35 minute Theory and it's a beautiful Lifestyle on there but then to have to go to the CBD or wherever you're going every day that was yeah it drained me real quick yeah and after having all those ideas sitting in my head and then that sub track playing in the background through podcasts and things of freedom and location Independence and digital nomadism I needed to do my own thing and so through Sam's course I launched my first product e-commerce engine and then we did a million and it was about 13 months yeah well yeah talk about timing as well unfair advantages back in the day when you could get leads for a dollar on Facebook and course 50 bucks yeah yeah but just got on the phone first price point was 2500 yeah then put it up to 6 Grand later so walk me through that process so you've got all this expertise you've built in person he tells you how to package it into a course or are you coaching one-to-one what does that look yeah the classic course with calls model that I call it now I had a Google drive folder with six modules in it and an introduction yeah a free Facebook group no sorry a Facebook group which is obviously free but paid for for clients yeah and then then a weekly call with what was it called on go to webinar oh goodness yeah 400 bucks a month at the time man yeah that's crazy yeah we don't know how good I'm done now it was great yeah and e-commerce them was really fragmented so it's pre-shopify so it was really people had all these different it wasn't pre-shopify but it was early it wasn't a big thing it is now the de facto solution for Ecom yeah so all these people had all these different platforms and the tech stuff was a bit of a nightmare yeah so to give them email templates and card abandoned sequences and conversion and Facebook ad templates it was a brand new thing at the time to that to that market it was what you give me stuff that works out of the box and I just go and copy and paste it and you help me modify it and I use it and it makes money yeah cool and so that was the most natural people for you to work with I guess having got come from grab one and Groupon yeah was you're now just in that e-commerce space you're not a coach helping coaches get clients it's you have an e-commerce store it's I've seen three billion dollars of e-commerce transactions flow past my herbals yeah so I was I know how to make people buy stuff online yeah so what was that learning curve going online the biggest learning curve was just the deployment of it because I thought I had to know all the tech and all those things the click funnels templates and that stuff yeah so that's all the stuff that that tripped me up sorry guys quick technical difficulty I had a camera that overheated we are back in the game so we're talking about you coaching online e-commerce and talking about the learning curve and so the biggest challenge for you at that time was the deployment they're getting the stuff done yeah going through all the steps yeah well it's the the stuff that you think you need that you don't really

.0 and then I sat there I thought about it and I was :41 am I becoming new Dan Bolton or am I becoming true Dan Moulton now funny play on words but for me what's really :47 interesting is if I think about who I was as an 18 year old I'm more reflective of the 18 year old now :54 and this season than I have been for the last five years because I deviated so far from the values of the vision that I :00 had for my life now this is of course not true at every age I can't look back at Dan Moulton at seven dead :06 multiple seven wanted to be a backup dancer in the Spice Girls 100 True got my mum to call the travel agents to :14 figure out how much it would cost to fly to the UK you took action you're an action taker The Action preseason :21 already believe in my ability to figure it out but when we look at overall I'm gonna make that dream come true for you one day I promise please bring back the :29 reunion when we look over the our lives there is so much breadcrumbs as :34 to who the true version of us is yeah definitely so Evolution we think about it in terms of the self-creation but :40 it's almost the self-discovery of the person that was always there I think Michelangelo carved David is that is that who :47 did it was it Leonardo da Vinci one of the one of the greats right he carved David out of the Rock and he said David was always there I just had to chip away :54 everything that was not him and and I think the process of evolution is almost that that it's not as if you :59 and I are blank slates right now and we go who do we want to be there's a level of freedom to that but it's almost who have we always been that we've :07 been ignoring this whole time the idea for me building my business around creation now dude I grew up :14 playing music all I wanted to do was play music as an adult that was the only thing I dreamed of doing was music drama :20 Then I then I spent almost a decade of my life where the main part of what I did was speaking and creating messages :26 yeah and then I started an ads agency and I was just an ad accounts all day and then I built a team and I was just :32 in meetings all day there was no point where I was this is the version of Dan that I feel I'm supposed to be I just lost sight of that and it's it's :40 so tough that it takes really low moments for us to get there but whatever :45 it takes for us to get there it's almost less about imagining and it's more about remembering :52 it's more about remembering the person we've always been and coming back to that the the interesting one story :58 I told recently was the pervasive childhood memory for me was Lego :03 so I would get Lego and I would assemble it and I'd immediately disassemble it and then make it into lots of different :10 things that were my own creations and it's interesting I'd done the same thing in business right I'd immediately :16 learned something and then disassemble it and make it slightly mine to get a result from it and I still do that to :22 this day that that innate okay there's a pattern here there's a system to follow :28 but in the process of building that system I think I've seen a better way to do it I'm going to do it on my own and :35 again I ignored that or so many times where I overplayed that as as a :41 one-trick pony of being I'm just going to be a derivative of that and it is largely remembering that find something :48 stand on the shoulders of giants but then in a from a creative sense down on the shoulder of :54 Giants and then choose choose

## Complete Framework

## # Processed Transcript ## Introduction & Welcome Hey! Peeps

# Processed Transcript ## Introduction & Welcome Hey! Peeps. I seem to have zoom open twice. I don't even know how that's possible, but it's working. Just wait a minute while you'll roll in. I'll drop the usual in the chat. It's about the dock and this one is going to expand as we go along, so add add some ads and other things as we go along, because it's a pretty dynamic dynamic funnel. So the daily client machine how's that for size? The the font. Good. I know these Google docs are good, good, good. So. Jim Tyrrell: Good enough. James Kemp: Good enough, that's all we need. So daily flight machine coming up to coming up to 7 years old in terms of in terms of a concept and the market is the same and different in many ways. But what hasn't changed is that, market dynamics are exactly that the distribution of a market is exactly that so client serving businesses are set up to serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace won't become a client. and over a long enough time period. If we quote unquote nurture people long enough and stay consistent, then clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. And what you find is that on average people will. turn one to 5% of their audience., and that's a broad metric into a client. So, you get a thousand people. You get a thousand leads, and, over time you get 10 to 30 clients out of a pretty common ratios. And there's 2 issues with this that it's really inefficient. If you're not selling to 990 or 970 people that you've, got the attention of, captured the details off and got the permission to talk to. Then that's it's a large portion of wastage.

---

Future buyers and customers captured early
Faster cashflow and marketing scale
31% of email list are buyers
Higher conversion rates on future offers
Enhancing Lead Generation Efficiency
James discussed the inefficiencies of traditional lead generation systems, highlighting that only 1-5% of an audience typically converts to clients, resulting in significant waste. He emphasized the need for scalable and controlled systems to identify potential clients early and generate cash flow during growth. James also explained different client types, from those investing in long-term coaching to occasional buyers, and stressed the importance of adapting strategies to the evolving market. He concluded that while traditional lead generation methods still work, they are not sustainable for long-term growth and need to be improved for better efficiency and scalability.
Unified Funnel Strategy Integration
James discussed his work on integrating two distinct funnel approaches into a unified strategy. He explained how the dual-mode client generation system can use non-client buyers to fund marketing efforts while targeting high-quality prospects. James outlined two main buying types: one focused on consuming information and deriving insight, and another on purchasing and consuming information. He emphasized that both approaches have their advantages and can be used together to create a more effective funnel system. James also touched on the importance of understanding the context around offers, including what happens before and after the offer itself.
Marketing Strategies and Content Optimization
James discussed various marketing strategies, including hybrid offers, daily client machines, and video-based content. He emphasized the importance of using a style that is native to the presenter and highlighted the significance of the headline in driving conversions for big idea videos and VSLs. James also explained the concept of insight funnels, starting with high-tier offers and downselling if necessary, and discussed the effectiveness of different ad formats for low-ticket funnels. He concluded by explaining the DCM (Daily Client Machine) concept and the importance of presenting the same core ideas in different formats to appeal to different buying types.
Optimizing Low-Ticket Funnel Strategies

. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it. Then you need to decipher all those variables, and most people fail James Kemp: because they're being sold to by marketers whose default choice is marketing. James Kemp: and the best way to head a goal is not to work towards it is to work backwards from it James Kemp: because working fords is chaotic because there's so many potential variables, there's hundreds of ways to market and lot of them work. There's hundreds of ways to sell and a lot of them work. James Kemp: But working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage. James Kemp: because over a long enough time period and everybody's tried that we all have both approaches, get you to the goal, but working backwards, gets you there faster and with more certainty. James Kemp: So we're going to do 3 things James Kemp: we're going to create and validate a threek offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc. And that's what we're going to focus on today. James Kemp: We're going to create and sell a customer offer that converts 5% of its buyers into clients for you James Kemp: in that offer that we've just defined. James Kemp: Then we're going to automate the lead flow and the customer offer and Nsn. Customers into clients every week. James Kemp: So we go from making 3 K. And validating that to 3 KA week to 3 KA day. James Kemp: So we use 3 systems to do this. The hybrid offer James Kemp: which I'll talk about today, customers to clients and the daily client machine. James Kemp: The sequence is very, very, very, very important. because each of these systems solve for a specific stage. and we've got a master one before moving to the next one. James Kemp: and that's the right pace. James Kemp: Right? You may be at different stages, and everybody here is at different stages of the current offer of the marketing of the flow. James Kemp: But skipping steps is not speed. I constantly go back and reevaluate my offer based on feedback. James Kemp: One of the reasons that we use Google Docs is because it's dynamic, right? You can put it on the sales page. And those things later. Once you have something that converts at 30 to 40, James Kemp: but it's dynamic. I'm tweaking words. I'm tweaking, positioning all the time. James Kemp: so skipping steps is not speed. It sometimes feels it. I can just jump straight to marketing. I need more leads, so I can just jump jump to that. But it's just skipping steps. James Kemp: So mastery and the sequence compounds. The better your hybrid offer. The more clients you convert. the better your customers to client system, the more customers and clients you generate. and the better your daily client machine, the more leads turn into customers who turn into clients and and it compounds in action. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate

## Examples & Case Studies

## The Power of a Singular Idea in Dual Modes It's more likely to be consumed than it is. If it's behind a paywall paid information has attention and attention advantage. If people pay, they tend to pay attention right? And so putting information and insight in front of people using both at the same time, is the force multiplier. And this, gets above that. What is the one funnel. There isn't 1 funnel. There is understanding the principles behind, a singular idea, being deployed and deploying it in different modes. So the Dcm 2.0 deploys both at the same time. and we create the same. We take the same idea and create 2 funnels. Each funnel leads to an offer. The client. Funnel uses an insight path. So consumption of information, and the customer funnel uses an info path. Purchasing and consuming information right? So as always, it's much simpler to show you rather than tell you so. One of the things that is the most challenging with offers right when we're making offers is what precedes the offer? What happens around the offer that you're making? And we, when we look at Google Docs, we often look at the the offer. That's inside the Google Doc. But we need to understand what's happened before that. And we also need to understand what's happened after it as well. That's my, both my zooms going off at once. So the client funnel works with both organic content and paid traffic right? So the top of the funnel we have content and pre-selling content is about 2 different things. It's about consistency and understanding that there's only really 3 content types that we're putting out there. So pre-selling content does exactly that. It pre- sells them on. What can happen next. So the content types are our mechanisms. I will talk about the hybrid offer. I will show how it works. I'll give different examples to it. I will talk about the daily client machine. I'll show how it works. I'll give different examples to it.

---

## Content Strategy & World Building This pre-sells people on the ideas that these things work and gives them insight that it might work for them right? And so the other top content types are, the identity I talk about the sovereign consultant. I talk about the sovereign components and and the process, and especially with video based content. You are showing those things as well rather than just telling right? So where are you? What is the background? What world are you in. What's your philosophy? Who's around you? What is the day in the life, what is behind the scenes? Who are the characters? If you're on a refresher on those things, then it's in the authority training in the, in the membership. So the world building is., the things around you, and though they can be, stories, I do, stop marketing, start demonstrating as me, just talking about my experience and pointing something out and giving inside philosophy online coaching is dead. But there's lots of things that are more mechanistic here as well. That content, if we're doing it from a content way, then funnels them to a big idea. Video. And this is for all intents and purposes of Vsl. I don't call it a Vsl, because I have found. There's no actual formula that applies to each individual. There are particular formulas that apply to certain categories. If you're just selling coaching, there's a particular formula for that. If you're just selling agency, there's a particular formula for a Vsl that works really well, and a lot of those Vsls to be honest work very well in call funnels, but less well in insight funnels. So I frame my, big idea as a demo.

. Tom Rolley: Thank you. James Kemp: An insight based funnel will by nature educate people about, talk to pains. James Kemp: talk to problems, present solutions, and then say, do you want to fix them. James Kemp: whereas info funnel is, you've got a problem. James Kemp: Here's something that solves that problem. James Kemp: I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. You've probably got another problem James Kemp: would. I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. Hey? Do you want help solving all these problems at once? We should work together. Tom Rolley: And daily client machine is only info, or Tom Rolley: is it inside as well, can you . James Kemp: The new way of doing it. you're delivering those things both of those things at once, because they complement each other. James Kemp: The old way of doing it was, generating a lead, then trying to liquidate the customer, etc. But you only get one buying type James Kemp: right. And my. James Kemp: I've got high level clients who have come through both paths. They've watched videos. They've reached out to me James Kemp: right. And then I've got people who just bought and bought and bought and bought until we had the conversation of, Hey, do you just want to stop buying stuff and work together James Kemp: same people, but the path that they came through was distinct in terms of who they were, how they bought, and some people flick between different buying types based on timing in different ways, and some people only buy that certain way. James Kemp: Alright. James Kemp: I know people who never ever buy info products. James Kemp: and they won't buy any high ticket that way. And I also people who will not get on a call won't talk to someone won't watch a video that's longer than 30 seconds, and we'll just buy info products all day long and then go. I'm going to hire you for this. James Kemp: Right? They're different buying paths. Tom Rolley: Okay. Cool. James Kemp: And if we only use one of them, then we're limited on. James Kemp: We're limited on a few fronts, and James Kemp: where we are in terms of marketplace and maturity. And those things. It's it's it's pretty difficult to James Kemp: to grow and scale things when you're James Kemp: when you're limited, not understanding the James Kemp: what, what what is taking place. Tom Rolley: Okay, cool, cool. Yeah. building for both of those buying styles Tom Rolley: and then not eliminating the other one. Tom Rolley: Yeah, cool. Okay. James Kemp: Anymore, for anymore. Tom Rolley: Siobhan's got her hand up. I don't know whether you can see that one, but. James Kemp: I cannot. Tom Rolley: It's just showing on mine. James Kemp: Got a question. Siobhan.

## Q&A: Organic vs. Paid Ad Messaging Shevaune Ray: Yep, Shevaune Ray: congrats to Tom for pronouncing my name correctly. 1st of all. I just had a quick one, and sorry I'm out getting ice cream. I didn't think I'd get on. Shevaune Ray: So you were saying that with paid ads when you started differentiating who you were talking to by saying, coaches versus consultants, that Shevaune Ray: your paid ad spend bent down when you're using these in an organic way, or with your existing audience, did it convert better when you did that as well. James Kemp: No. Shevaune Ray: Okay. James Kemp: But that's self-fulfilling, right? Because the majority of my audience I've already got as James Kemp: self-selected by being those people. Anyway. James Kemp: Yeah, I don't tend to Co. In content. I don't tend to speak to a specific category or identity too much. But in ads, they're showing them to so many different people James Kemp: right? The filter that you go past it is this for me, has to be a lot more explicit and standing out in in most cases. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that's it's something I've been playing with in my Shevaune Ray: wording. And how I speak to people. I it's so all over the place. Sometimes when I'm targeting Shevaune Ray: and I'm not specific, I can convert crazy. Sometimes Shevaune Ray: those saying the same things just doesn't do anything, and I don't know if it's the market, or it's me, or it's how I'm saying it. But I have realized that Shevaune Ray: I need to unbundle my products more because I was doing exactly what you were just talking about, which they solved a problem. Everybody was really happy, but they didn't want to really do more work because it solved it for too long. Shevaune Ray: and then they would go off, and they'd be happy for so long that I was, Well. Shevaune Ray: I'm nurturing you, and I'm talking to you, and I'm trying to sell you more things, and they were just, no, I'm I'm good I'm good now. Shevaune Ray: So I was selling them one high ticket thing, and they were good for a year. And that just doesn't really work for return clients. Shevaune Ray: So I was selling them one high ticket thing, and they were good for a year. And that just doesn't really work for return clients. James Kemp: That's the paradox of some work. Is that James Kemp: doing a good job limits the lifetime value of a client. Shevaune Ray: And ultimately they can't act on Shevaune Ray: all of it, either. They just feel they are, because they have all the information. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, there, in most cases, most people just want relief from how they feel what they're feeling today. James Kemp: That. Shevaune Ray: And that's. James Kemp: And their drive and their will to James Kemp: transcend their current limitations is quite limited. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever

. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever. And then we'll just reach James Kemp: the limitations, but would also be missing out on a ton of people who bought in a different way. James Kemp: And also we would buy, we could run, lead, lead funnels and those things all day long. James Kemp: but would also be missing out on the people who buy via an infopath and buy products and consume them, etc. Etc. And that's their buying style. Shevaune Ray: Chat too. James Kemp: And the I'm looking for things sustainable. I don't want to be building a new funnel. James Kemp: . I don't want to be building a new funnel every year. I want the core laid down, and then just reframing it, and modifying it as it goes along, rather than . Oh, my God! The webinars, died after 6 months, or the lead magnet stopped working after 3. James Kemp: That's exhausting for most people. So we need a, we need a methodology and a philosophy that's got utility. We can add different. James Kemp: We can change the video. We can change the frontier product. But. Shevaune Ray: And that's I do appreciate that. I know. I I told you that I just switched over to go high level and I appreciate that about that system is that you can set it up with multiple entry points, and all you have to change is the workflow. Instead of rewriting the whole thing. If you just want to switch something out. James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah., once, once the James Kemp: once we've got the especially the info funnel working, it's, okay, let's put some more offers on the front because the bumps the same, the membership offers the same, the upsells the same. So you're just changing out the front end. And, products, fatigue markets, fatigue, things change, and on an increasingly. James Kemp: quick basis, right? And James Kemp: AI, and these things will accelerate that because people feel that they've got much deeper, information inside than they probably necessarily have, so they'll make very good products. James Kemp: But because people are buying them, and that's proven and gpts. And these things the people who are selling them are doing very well. James Kemp: but also they're on the back end. They're tough to convert, because you've you've given every everybody, everything they needed. James Kemp: And you've you've got true cannibalization. So yeah, it's the. Shevaune Ray: Are you going to talk more about? Shevaune Ray: Were you gonna talk more about AI in this meeting? James Kemp: Not today. Shevaune Ray: Not today. That was the other call, okay? Shevaune Ray: yeah. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed

. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, there's there's fatigue all over right, because it's the same stuff James Kemp: largely propagated by the same people. James Kemp: And, people have gone around it, and so James Kemp: they've they've come around and come back to the beginning and, well, what now? James Kemp: I still don't have the things I want. I'm still not the person I want to be. I'm still not getting the results. I want to be. What now. Shevaune Ray: And that's I'm trying to tap into that and get my messaging around that exact thing because I've identified it. But it's Shevaune Ray: what part of that gets people to take action and move instead of just making them more depressed and not want to do anything. So that's that's what I've been playing with in your bundling and unbundling video, the client or customers to clients. Shevaune Ray: And the daily client machine has been, I just keep going back to those and saying, Okay, I'm going to Shevaune Ray: found something different in there. I'm going to change this around. I'm going to do that. And I think I'm gonna Shevaune Ray: sit with the templates from this, and really go to town on it. James Kemp: Yeah, when when things are. James Kemp: when things are tough, or you or you think, you're throwing different stuff out there. And it's James Kemp: when things are tough, or you or you think, you're throwing different stuff out there. And it's James Kemp: sometimes working or not working, there's nothing consistent. James Kemp: Then return back to 1st principles, which is, get a customer James Kemp:, what are we in the business of getting customers. James Kemp: But most things are downstream from that. James Kemp: And it. It just so happens that the nature of James Kemp: online marketing and these things which are, under 10 years old. James Kemp: Everybody went to get a high ticket client, and James Kemp: not appreciating that there were a particular set of circumstances where that worked really really well. James Kemp: because we combined high ticket and high margin with high scale and cheap traffic. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that's for me. I was selling Shevaune Ray: a high ticket customer offer. And I thought I had cracked the code. I thought I was doing amazing, because most of my month was free, and I only had to sell 4 people to be making a lot of money. And I was I did it. I figured out the thing. This is the smartest thing ever. No, because as soon as as soon as the market shifts Shevaune Ray: all those leads dry up, and you have to keep selling and selling and selling every month. And where do they go after they work with you? There's nowhere to put them. Shevaune Ray: and they're not in your world. James Kemp: It's hard to sell recurring products when there's no recurring problems. James Kemp: And some people have recurring product problems where they just don't identify them

 The plan: 
> "We will install the sovereign system, talk about the client offer, customer offers, and then install the daily client machine."
 The promise, the plan, and the phases. This offer lives and dies on this page. Everything else is logistics. Price is relevant to value. $100/week. What's the risk? Weekly frame, come in, can leave. I choose no guarantees, promises, or refunds. Guarantees are a product of trust perception. The more track record you have, the less you need a guarantee. ## Maximizing Community Economics and the Hybrid Offer Approach **Summary:** James discusses strategies for maximizing community revenue, including offering annual payments with bonuses and utilizing the hybrid offer model to present multiple tiers without confusing potential clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We use the $100/week as a hook. Getting payment upfront is preferable. The average $100/week person stays 15-18 weeks, worth $1500-$1800. If we get $3000 upfront, we get cash upfront and they're more committed. I have a $3900 annual offer with a one-on-one call. This converts at 30%. To maximize conversions, I'd offer it at $2500-$3000. Offering $2500 annually is over a 50% discount. We use pricing to incentivize and collect cash. The hybrid offer sells the first tier without harming conversion to the client offer. 
> "You're receiving regular workshops and 24/7 access. Beyond that, have an option for my personal help. Members can upgrade or I can build you a custom plan to take an offer from $3k to $3k/week to $3k/day."
 The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."

- ```txt ## Crafting a Compelling Offer **Summary:** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Welcome! Today, we'll focus on constructing your daily client machine—how to generate leads hourly, customers daily, and clients weekly. It's critical to attack things in the right order: offer, then sales, then marketing. The best way to hit a goal is to work backward from it. Create and validate an offer, make three sales with a Google Doc, create a customer offer that converts 5% of buyers into clients, and then automate lead flow, customer offers, and ascend customers into clients weekly. This system creates leads and customers, engages with customers to understand their intent, and captures those who don't display immediate intent for future conversion. The two key components are your big idea and your customer offer. The process is: lead magnet (capture and opt-in), customer offer ($100 digital product), and client offer. The big idea is a product of your client and customer offers, a frame that catches attention, creates curiosity, and establishes authority. ## Big Ideas and Customer Offers **Summary:** This chunk explores different frames for creating a big idea, including swiping, next steps, automation, and identity. It also discusses the customer offer and its role in converting leads. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Many big ideas become so successful they become the brand. Consider these frames: swiping (copy my success), next steps (your first client), automation (automatic clients), and identity (the sovereign consultant). Big ideas often have utility across multiple products (books, courses, consulting). My big idea, "selling from a Google Doc," led to a daily client machine that generates 5-10 leads daily and 1-2 product sales, doubling with simple ads. Put your big idea everywhere—social media profiles, ads. The customer offer turns leads into customers. Ideal components include training, templates, a live workshop, and a call. ## Offer Creation and Validation **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer creation, validation through market feedback, and the key principles of promise, process, and plan. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The path to a million-dollar business is simple, not easy: promise, process, mechanisms, plan, validation, sales, scale, automation. The hybrid offer is key, a single offer with multiple products. Four reasons people buy help: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Focus on one core reason; everything else is a benefit. Understand the problem/desire you're solving. Validation is getting your offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. Use the community for feedback based on real data. ## Hybrid Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk explains the hybrid offer, its advantages over traditional consulting, and provides specific pricing recommendations for community offers, consulting offers, and customer offers. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer, containing multiple products. It includes a 12-month ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Pricing examples: Community offers ($100-200/week, $3,000 annual), consulting offers ($300-600/week), customer offers ($100). This pricing maximizes conversions and economics, making it easy to get started and upgrade. ## Offer Construction Principles **Summary:** This chunk details the three core principles of offer construction: promise, process, and plan. It stresses the importance of clarity, future pacing, and avoiding information overload. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** Three principles: promise (what gets done), process (how it works), plan (how it rolls out)

. This approach simplifies the process and allows for quicker client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** This is a lead magnet on steroids or a reduction of a workshop. Right? And again, most people here have done both of those things, and the book is the happy middle ground in terms of the asset that is created from those, and also an asset that ultimately we can put into something that's got bit better economics. ## Chris Benetti on Book Funnels and Client Acquisition **Summary:** Chris Benetti emphasizes the importance of viewing a book as a tool for client acquisition, rather than striving for a large, complex publication. A shorter, focused book created quickly can be more effective for generating clients. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I think the point you made, a book, not the book is is huge. I think that's a massive thing that most people just they see, all of the Russell Brunson's, and they see, Dan Martell, buy back your time, and they're man. These books are massive, we've got to do best seller and all this crap. And it's just., that's that's great for them, and where they're at, and their status in life, and what they're trying to accomplish. But for you, you most likely want to get clients from your book. And so the the book doesn't need to be. Doesn't need to be a thing, and it it should just be a a machine in the cog, for where you're at right now, and what you want to achieve from the book and I'm sure those guys get clients because they have these massive things that they're putting out there. But that's that's, probably 2 years worth of work to create one of those assets and to to create a marketing campaign around that. And it's just, I'd rather you guys turn out a book in a weekend and get clients next week. ## Framing Your Book Around Client Problems and Solutions **Summary:** Chris Benetti advises focusing on the core problems clients face and creating a book that offers solutions and a clear path to working with you. This simple approach can be highly effective for client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** and and I think it's more simple than we think. So the the thing from my perspective that I to just talk about is is the frame. So a lot of a lot of people work with you guys because you have a solution to offer, and they're likely struggling with a core common problem. And so if we can just identify what that problem is, and then write a book that, talks about the solution right then and there, and then a pathway to how they can work with you to achieve that thing. Then that's a very simple cycle that we can control and create. And it doesn't need to be complicated. ## Mechanism Books, Client Acquisition, and the Path to Traditional Publishing **Summary:** Mechanism-focused books often outperform big idea books in sales due to their problem-solving nature. A client-getting book can also pave the way for traditional publishing opportunities later on. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Those the mechanism books sell better than the big Big idea books, because they're more immediate and they're more problem focused. So the daily client machine was very, very easy book to sell. It had a very high conversion rate, and it had a very high conversion rate off the back end, because the the this is how you get clients every day is a, a common thing that's top of mind. So the mechanism books are a little bit easier to sell them, anyways, because they're more problem orientated and solution orientated than

. So the daily client machine was very, very easy book to sell. It had a very high conversion rate, and it had a very high conversion rate off the back end, because the the this is how you get clients every day is a, a common thing that's top of mind. So the mechanism books are a little bit easier to sell them, anyways, because they're more problem orientated and solution orientated than . A concept the sovereign consultant where someone's going to look and look at what's that? Just to close off on the book idea? Our book can lead to the book. I've been approached by publishers twice over the years and said. You've got a book, and you've got an audience and you've got. Do you want to write a book? The book with us so. But I wouldn't have been able to have those conversations, and someone reach out until I had a book out there in the 1st place. ## Book Economics and the Importance of Distribution **Summary:** Maximizing book sales requires effective distribution, which in turn necessitates sound economics. The goal is to create a funnel that allows for paid traffic and ideally generates enough revenue to cover ad costs, making customer acquisition free. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the the book and the economics matter a lot . Candidly, you could write a book, stand alone and not do any of the funnel things, put it on. Amazon. Run a basic funnel to it. You get clients right. It can be a really effective customer and client generation tool on its own., there's plenty of people have built pretty okay, little businesses just having a book and not thinking about any of the economics. But to maximize the book and the economics, we need to have distribution right to maximize any asset we need to have distribution. So we need maximum economics to maximize that distribution because we can do something that is the unicorn of of marketing. We can get the product to pay for itself. So we need to plan its economics and create a funnel which allows us to run paid traffic to the book. ## Self-Liquidating Book Funnels and Ad Tracker Transparency **Summary:** James Kemp shares his ad tracker, demonstrating how a well-structured book funnel can be front-end profitable, covering ad costs and even generating profit. Transparency in tracking, including agency fees, is crucial for understanding true funnel economics. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the the simple goal we have for this is to generate enough revenue from the product sales to cover ad costs. So here's the tiny Tiny. He doesn't make it. This Tiny. He lets me read it. Here's the here's the the a snapshot of the ad tracker that Chris and his team do for do for me every day. So Alex uploads the the sales numbers, and then Chris puts the the ad spend in including his fee. and remember that, when you're looking at outgoings. If you work with anybody in an agency, a lot of agencies will pretend that the fee doesn't exist, and it's just, it's all gravy. But the but Chris puts his fee in here. So it's super transparent about what the actual economics of the funnel is. ## The "More of the Same" Principle in Book Funnels **Summary:** Book funnels should offer additional products and resources that expand upon the core idea presented in the book. This "more of the same" approach caters to different consumption preferences and maximizes the value offered within the funnel. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** when I asked Chris yesterday, I'm, What's the what's the message about the book funnel ? What's the how should people think about it? He said. Something that's, very simple in terms of its concept, which is more of the same. If someone is buying the book

. He explains that this speed transmits a potent energy and makes the content more compelling and alive for the audience. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** And so speed to message matters. If you give an insight or you get an insight, and then you create the content quickly off the back of that, then that content will be very, very potent. So Brad was in my house. He came here for a VIP, we spent a day writing on the, with the dogs writing on the window, putting out a plan for him for the next year. It was about 800,000, he wanted to go to a million, and he wanted to crack that number. So I documented the day, I talked about what happened, I took a couple of pictures, and I gave some insights about what plan he was undertaking, what he was doing. So when I'm reporting that in real time, it gives the content some potency and aliveness. ## The Importance of Context in Content Creation **Summary:** James Kemp explains that content needs a superstructure and scaffolding, emphasizing the crucial role of context. He argues that content without context is just noise and advises inserting mechanisms, identity, and world into content to create meaning. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** Before you make content, you need a superstructure. You need some scaffolding. And what is absent in most content is context. So content that doesn't create context is just noise. And God forgive me, most of you are just creating a lot of noise because you're not creating context. And you just need these small elements in your content to create that context. So when we are creating content, we must insert context to move people towards our ideas. And we do this by putting in our mechanisms, the identity that we are helping people unfold, and the world that we live in, into our content. So when we link our unique mechanisms with a problem someone is currently facing, it gives them context. This is the problem that Bob was facing. This is the mechanism he used to solve that. There is a mechanism to solve that problem, and it's possessed by Ryan, or Michael, or Jared. We link our aspirational identity to a demonstration of our philosophy, and during that we create context. When people are looking at content or marketing, they tend to look forward. They don't say, "What offer am I making?" They say, "What ad do I need to run?" They don't say, "What's the context and content inside my offer?" They say, "What content do I need to create?" We need to work backwards towards the market. So we define the mechanisms we make offers with, and we create content around those mechanisms. ## Content, Mechanisms, and Context: A Real-World Example **Summary:** James Kemp provides a real-world example of how he uses mechanisms to create context in his content. He discusses specific mechanisms used within his programs and how he consistently incorporates them into his content across various platforms. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** Here's a living, breathing example. Inside the syndicate, the circle, and the membership, we do three pretty simple things: we create a hybrid offer that people can buy off a Google Doc, we run workshops that we sell tickets to, and we turn those customers into clients, and we generate leads with the daily client machine. So inside our world, we do and build those things. Inside our workshops, we give more context to those things. How do you create a hybrid offer? So we show, we have a look behind the curtain. In the content that I create, I will be speaking about the mechanisms over and over again. I will be talking about the hybrid offer over and over again, and inserting it into one of my content types

. So inside our world, we do and build those things. Inside our workshops, we give more context to those things. How do you create a hybrid offer? So we show, we have a look behind the curtain. In the content that I create, I will be speaking about the mechanisms over and over again. I will be talking about the hybrid offer over and over again, and inserting it into one of my content types. I'll be talking about customers to clients, creating customers, turning them into clients, multiple times, because it's a mechanism that is effective and we use it. And I'll be talking about the daily client machine multiple times. So by just inserting those mechanisms into my content, I'm creating context within the content that I create. So if I go to Facebook right now, and I search the word "hybrid," and I look for posts from me, and I search the word "hybrid," you will see how consistently I have created context around that word, the hybrid offer. I've created it so much that everyone in the world has stolen the idea from me. I partly jest, but the nature of inserting the mechanism over and over again means that I'm generating context about that mechanism all the time. My consistency is not only in the creation of the content, but it's also on the insertion of the mechanism. ## Mechanisms, Identity, and Market Differentiation **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of unique mechanisms and a clear identity as key differentiators in a commoditized market. He explains that mechanisms are the unique ways problems are solved and should be consistently highlighted in content. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** And, I've been shouting from the rooftops recently about competition and comparison, and what's left for people to compete on. The only thing left for you to compete on is your unique mechanisms and the ideas that you bring to the market. Everything else is commoditized. Every single other thing can be copied and replicated. But your mechanisms and your orientation towards those mechanisms, the mechanism being the way that you get results, is the thing that you can consistently do that. So we can do this after, in the workshop portion. But if we create context around our mechanisms and we insert those repeatedly, and then we have an aspirational identity – you don't even need to be that good at content and that good at communication, you just need to be consistent with the messaging – mechanisms come down to the unique way you solve problems and a clarity over who those problems are solved for, or the desires they have. ## Content Creation Superstructure and Resources **Summary:** James Kemp reiterates the importance of context in content and directs his audience to additional resources on mechanisms, identity, and authority within his membership and syndicate programs. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** So after we've thought about what context we want to deliver, what mechanisms we have that we want to insert into the content, by the way, if you're in the membership of the syndicate, more on mechanisms and identity and creation and authority in the classroom. So I've linked directly to that. So once we've inserted the context piece, we need to have the actual content., what do we say and what do we write about? ## The Power Laws of Content and Four Content Buckets **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the power laws of content, stating that a small percentage of content drives the majority of results. He then outlines four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problem, and plan – as tools for effective content creation. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** The power laws in content are the power laws in anything else. 95% of the results from social and from content are driven by less than 5% of your content

. So I will create content that attempts to tell that story. So philosophy is you. What do you believe, and what is your worldview? To a lesser or greater extent, all of my clients share some or all of my worldview about my ideas about sovereignty and freedom and these pieces. So I share those on a regular basis because being my people is an important part of being in my world. It's very useful to believe those things. If people want to build a gigantic business with a glass building with a name on it, then I'm probably not the right guy to talk to. And so I need to be clear in my content that this is what I believe, and this is what I stand for, and this is also what I don't believe in as well. ## Proof Content: Demonstrating How Results are Achieved **Summary:** James Kemp defines proof content as going beyond testimonials by providing insights into how clients achieved results. He stresses the importance of highlighting the mechanisms used to achieve success, making the process replicable for potential clients. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** The second type is proof, and proof is different to, say, a case study or a testimonial. It's different to a testimonial, but it's definitely my take on a case study. Proof is proving you can help someone by demonstrating how you help someone. And solid proof goes beyond testimonials. It delivers insight on how someone you worked with got a result, and mechanisms are very, very useful when you're talking about proof. So this post here, talking about how Tom made 19k in sales helping people finish their music. He joined the syndicate, so I'm inserting the product name, the thing he participated in. And then I'm talking about the mechanisms that are used to generate that 19k. Again, an example many years ago from Matt, the eight steps that he took to transform his business with a case study. I'm not saying just what the results were. I am telling people the mechanisms these people used to get the results. And that's the distinction between a typical case study. Most case studies aim to boost the credibility of the person narrating the story. I'm seeking to generate an insight to show that there's things that are accessible for people to get a result, that if you use a hybrid offer, if you use customers to clients, if you use the daily client machine, etc., that you can get a result behind them. So there's that. I dig deeper into more of those examples, and the actual breakdown of those and the ultimate case study template, which is again in the classroom. But, at a very simple level, these are one step beyond a case study. They're not saying just what happened, they're demonstrating how it happened as well. ## Problem Content: Sharing Insights and Solutions **Summary:** James Kemp defines problem content as sharing insights gathered from experience, offering solutions to common problems. He advocates for providing complete solutions within the content, demonstrating expertise and building trust. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** Problem. So this is, share an insight that you gather from delivering. The more common the problem, and the more unique your approach to solving it, the more traction these posts get. This is where a belief in giving everybody everything they need in your content is useful. I don't hold back when I tell stories that I create. I don't say,

## Components

### ```txt ## Crafting a Compelling Offer **Summary

** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Welcome! Today, we'll focus on constructing your daily client machine—how to generate leads hourly, customers daily, and clients weekly. It's critical to attack things in the right order: offer, then sales, then marketing. The best way to hit a goal is to work backward from it. Create and validate an offer, make three sales with a Google Doc, create a customer offer that converts 5% of buyers into clients, and then automate lead flow, customer offers, and ascend customers into clients weekly. This system creates leads and customers, engages with customers to understand their intent, and captures those who don't display immediate intent for future conversion. The two key components are your big idea and your customer offer. The process is: lead magnet (capture and opt-in), customer offer ($100 digital product), and client offer. The big idea is a product of your client and customer offers, a frame that catches attention, creates curiosity, and establishes authority. ## Big Ideas and Customer Offers **Summary:** This chunk explores different frames for creating a big idea, including swiping, next steps, automation, and identity. It also discusses the customer offer and its role in converting leads. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Many big ideas become so successful they become the brand. Consider these frames: swiping (copy my success), next steps (your first client), automation (automatic clients), and identity (the sovereign consultant). Big ideas often have utility across multiple products (books, courses, consulting). My big idea, "selling from a Google Doc," led to a daily client machine that generates 5-10 leads daily and 1-2 product sales, doubling with simple ads. Put your big idea everywhere—social media profiles, ads. The customer offer turns leads into customers. Ideal components include training, templates, a live workshop, and a call. ## Offer Creation and Validation **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer creation, validation through market feedback, and the key principles of promise, process, and plan. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The path to a million-dollar business is simple, not easy: promise, process, mechanisms, plan, validation, sales, scale, automation. The hybrid offer is key, a single offer with multiple products. Four reasons people buy help: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Focus on one core reason; everything else is a benefit. Understand the problem/desire you're solving. Validation is getting your offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. Use the community for feedback based on real data. ## Hybrid Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk explains the hybrid offer, its advantages over traditional consulting, and provides specific pricing recommendations for community offers, consulting offers, and customer offers. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer, containing multiple products. It includes a 12-month ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Pricing examples: Community offers ($100-200/week, $3,000 annual), consulting offers ($300-600/week), customer offers ($100). This pricing maximizes conversions and economics, making it easy to get started and upgrade. ## Offer Construction Principles **Summary:** This chunk details the three core principles of offer construction: promise, process, and plan. It stresses the importance of clarity, future pacing, and avoiding information overload. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** Three principles: promise (what gets done), process (how it works), plan (how it rolls out)

# Daily Client Machine Framework

## Overview

This guide is for users who already have the DCM 2.

## Complete Framework

Constructing Your Daily Client Machine
How To Generate Leads Hourly, Customers Daily and Clients Weekly
The Sequence - The Order of Events Matters
To hit $1m, it is critical we attack it in the right order.
The common approach is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it's to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it's skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.

The Daily Client Machine 2.0
How To Generate Leads, Customers and Clients Fast
Setting The Scene: Efficient Market Dynamics
Client serving businesses are set up to… serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace will not become a client. Over a long enough time period, clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. But efficiency is finding ways to shorten time periods.
Long sales cycles suck and are hard to scale.
Therefore, we must have efficient ways to identify who is most likely to become a client as early as possible.
Plus, it’s useful to generate cashflow from those who will never become clients in efficient ways.
Traditional Lead Generation
Traditional lead generation and acquisition is a game of large numbers.
Feed 1,000 people in the top.

“Nurture” them while each one slowly drops off.
Get 30 clients out the other end—if you’re good and lucky.
There are numerous issues with this approach. It works when the cost of generating a lead is low enough to waste 97% of the product of a system.
No systems on earth that waste 97% of their output have stood the test of time.
This approach only caters to one type of buying path.
The search for “the best” funnel is an endless one when the constraints are pre-determined.

Dual Mode Client Generation
The 2.0 approach deals with reality:
What we really want is clients, not buckets of leads.
We can use those who won’t immediately (or ever) become clients to fund our marketing
to get clients.
We can monetize IP we have already built.
We can shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness
prospects.
Dual Mode means we generate Leads and Customers at the same time using the same ideas.
We make information about our system freely available to consume, then funnel the attention into action.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction (i.e., get someone to give you money).
To get money, you must gain attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Two Buying Types
We need people to consume our ideas (and us) to buy into them.
The key word is consume.
One path a buyer can take:
Consumes information
Derives insight on how it could work for them
Takes the next step and puts the insight into action
The other:

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The DCM™
This system creates Leads and Customers.
You then engage with a customer to understand the intent and desire behind their action.
It creates a short term focus that is most likely to generate results over the shortest time period.
Efficiency.
It also captures those who do not display immediate intent so you can convert them into prospects via qualification/conversation or convert them into customers in the future.
The Daily Client Machine™
[There appears to be a diagram showing three connected boxes: "The Offer Code Template" -> "The Offer Code Product" -> "The Syndicate", with labels underneath: "Create A Lead" -> "Create A Customer" -> "Create A Client"]
Lead Flow vs Lead Conversion
A critical distinction in lead generation is flow vs conversion.
When people say they 'need more leads' my first goal is to determine whether they need more lead flow vs need more lead conversion.
Flow is the volume and conversion is the action.
The majority of people have a lead conversion bottleneck rather than a lead flow bottleneck.
You have enough leads, just no efficient way to convert them into customers and/or clients.
The most efficient way is to make an offer(s).. This allows the leads to self-select and demonstrate intent and narrows your focus to those who've demonstrated intent.
If you're not making enough sales yet have even a tiny audience that you're communicating with, focusing on lead conversion before lead flow will yield the highest results.
The Individual Components:

There are only two key components inside The Daily Client Machine, your Big Idea and your Customer Offer.
Armed with both you will get all the leads and customers you can handle.
The Big Idea
Illumination - Pain, Problem and Opportunity Unaware Offer: Lead Magnet Goal: Opt In
Customer Offer
Indoctrination - Pain and Problem Aware Offer: $50-$100 Digital Product Goal: Consumption and Implementation
The easiest way is to illustrate with an

Purchases information

Free information has a distribution advantage. Paid information has an attention advantage. Using both is a force multiplier.
The DCM 2.0™
We take the same idea and create two funnels. Each funnel leads to an offer.
The Client Funnel uses an insight path.
The Customer Funnel uses an info path.

The folks in The Syndicate are seeing that the model is pretty much everything.
Drop the skill into the right model and it unlocks the value.
The value is already there in your biz, it's just trapped in a sub-standard model that you've doggedly stuck to despite being stuck at the same revenue level for months.
Because a guru preached focus and shamed you away from changing it up despite it not working.
I'm not going to spend anytime 'selling you' on my model.
If you want to build a big empire with a big team you buy donuts for on Mondays then I'm definitely not your guy.
But I am willing to show you.
And short of becoming a client and joining The Syndicate (which is becoming a scarcer opportunity as I approach our 100 person limit ) what I've got for the next few days is as close as you're going to get.
Since Black Friday is coming up I'm going to use it basically give you 5 of my best trainings.
These strategies literally built this business and the folks inside my world are using them to do the same.
For the next few days or until it's sold out you can get:
The Offer Code, Hybrid Client, Customers To Clients, The Daily Client Machine and The Social Code
For $200.
These trainings will walk you through creating a high converting offer you can sell without calls, generating customers and cashflow you can turn into clients and having a flow of leads coming to you daily.
I know you've heard this all before but this is likely the first time you've been allowed to

Stacking PIF
Simply having a Pay in Full option in the cart.
I've found you get higher conversion to PIF when it's NOT previously mentioned in the offer.
To maximise, PIF a 'discount' of 25-35% against the total of the pay plan will do it.
Best of Both Worlds
Simply have a PIF in the cart then offer upgrade options during onboarding.
Implementation:
Checklist:
1. Does your offer clearly define The 3 P's? 2. Does your offer use price engineering to maximise conversions and 'yes'? 3. Do you want to stack PIF or Stack LTV (or both)?
Discernment in using this training:
The 3P's will increase the conversions of your offer ● Price Engineering will increase the conversions of your offer and extend LTV ● Stacking will increase your LTV
All of these significantly move the needle. Be discerning when you add them.
If you know your market and audience very well you may choose to use all of the them simultaneously.
If you're just getting rolling, use them one at a time to boost conversions if your focus is making more sales or boost LTV if your focus is creating more value from the sales you're currently making.

Subject: An Offer So Good It's Insulting Body: Yesterday I launched the Black Friday.
And among the dozens of purchase and glowing praise from people who owned one of the trainings and are delighted to get more was this:
"Are you trying to insult me?
I've paid $300 for IC, DCM, SC
And now you offer me that plus 2 more for $200!
Where's my special offer for already believing in you and spending my $300...
Give me the extra 2 for free, that would be the right thing to do."
To which I promptly refunded all his previous purchases, told him he could keep access, never to buy any of my products again and wished him all the best.
Because you don't need customers who think like this.
And you surely don't need clients who think like this.
When an opportunity drops in their lap, immediately looking around for how they've been wronged, no one gets them and someone should bow down and save them.

4. Automate lead flow and Customer sales and stack recurring revenue that compounds
into $3k per day
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ to generate $3k 2. Customers to Clients™ to generate $3k a week and per day 3. The Daily Client Machine™to generate $3k per day recurring
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
The Sovereign Brand
Size does not matter.
There is no audience too small to get traction quickly.
Actually, the smaller the better in the beginning.
The myth of needing big followings and a huge track record are just that. Myths. Sold by people
who have big followings and gate keep via experience.
You need to have solved one problem once for yourself or someone else and know how to solve
it again.
Nothing more.
A brand is the thing people say about you when you're not there.
You live rent free in someone's head and they associate you with ideas and imagery.
The end point of a brand is to promote action.
When your brand consistently sells someone on ideas and imagery it is very easy to get them to
take action.
It's the natural next step.
The ideal brand does all the selling needed.
Then when an offer is made it's the natural next step.
Creating a brand like this is not easy but it is simple.
There's 3 components:

Future buyers and customers captured early
Faster cashflow and marketing scale
31% of email list are buyers
Higher conversion rates on future offers
Enhancing Lead Generation Efficiency
James discussed the inefficiencies of traditional lead generation systems, highlighting that only 1-5% of an audience typically converts to clients, resulting in significant waste. He emphasized the need for scalable and controlled systems to identify potential clients early and generate cash flow during growth. James also explained different client types, from those investing in long-term coaching to occasional buyers, and stressed the importance of adapting strategies to the evolving market. He concluded that while traditional lead generation methods still work, they are not sustainable for long-term growth and need to be improved for better efficiency and scalability.
Unified Funnel Strategy Integration
James discussed his work on integrating two distinct funnel approaches into a unified strategy. He explained how the dual-mode client generation system can use non-client buyers to fund marketing efforts while targeting high-quality prospects. James outlined two main buying types: one focused on consuming information and deriving insight, and another on purchasing and consuming information. He emphasized that both approaches have their advantages and can be used together to create a more effective funnel system. James also touched on the importance of understanding the context around offers, including what happens before and after the offer itself.
Marketing Strategies and Content Optimization
James discussed various marketing strategies, including hybrid offers, daily client machines, and video-based content. He emphasized the importance of using a style that is native to the presenter and highlighted the significance of the headline in driving conversions for big idea videos and VSLs. James also explained the concept of insight funnels, starting with high-tier offers and downselling if necessary, and discussed the effectiveness of different ad formats for low-ticket funnels. He concluded by explaining the DCM (Daily Client Machine) concept and the importance of presenting the same core ideas in different formats to appeal to different buying types.

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The Hybrid Offer™
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is ‘simple’, it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it’s easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.

The World you build, The Identity you craft and the Mechanisms you use.
Inside the World you build there are characters, settings, language and story lines. When a
world is in motion people can't help but pay attention.
The Identity is the one you represent yourself and the characteristics of who someone becomes
when they are inside your world. The transition and transformation of the human into their
ideals.
The Mechanisms are the way to get there. The map and the terrain of what must done for the
World to come to life and for The Identity to be manifested.
A brand can be successful with just one of these components, the best ones have all 3.
In order of fastest to slowest in terms of ROI:
1) Define and Sell Your Mechanism

The way you get results.
The only defining characteristic of your mechanism is that it needs to be unique.
It matters much more that it’s yours than what it does.
The underlying mechanism must work.
The underlying mechanism does not need to be yours.
But it must be positioned as unique and sprinkled with unique twists:
The Daily Client Machine = Lead magnet with a self liquidating offer Customers to Clients = low ticket workshops with an offer The Hybrid Offer = selling via doc
I invented none of these things. I just innovated on them and own the mechanism around them.
You don’t need many. One will do.
2) Craft An Aspirational Identity
Identity manifests from a core question:
Who does someone become when they commit to your world?
What ideal characteristics do they attain on an individual and societal level.
If we see our identity is a transaction with society then we can use currencies to define it.

Ideal Components
1. Training and Templates 2. Live Workshop 3. Call (if looking for call volume)
Guidelines:
Solve a single problem, deliver a single result • Sell them what they want, give them what they need • Magic pills sell in large numbers • Repurpose - use something you've already created • Small sum of larger part
Behind The Offer Code:
Having a great offer that's easy to sell and easy to buy is essential to businesses <$3m.
Knowing this indicates a moderate to high sophistication level.
I felt an offer training and templates would be a good lead offer as I opened up The Syndicate as it appeals to people who largely already have offers and would like to optimise them.
It plays to my strengths, has a high ROI potential and I had massive amounts of proof that the contents of the training was proven and effective.
Working Example
The Offer Code Daily Client Machine has been running for almost 3 months.
It generates 5-10 leads a day and 1-2 product sales. Double that when ads are running.

Paid Growth
I run basic ads with a small budget. Lead costs sit between $3-$8. With the conversion rate on The Offer Code it means the ads are essentially free.

Yesterday Andrew asked:
"I don't have any customers yet, let alone clients. I'm literally just starting my consulting journey and don't plan to launch until Feb next year. Is the content you're offering of value to me at such an early stage? I could be wrong but It feels like content your offering is for businesses further down the path."
My answer?
"It’s the fundamentals. Everyone needs those no matter the stage.
Start with the Offer Code in the bundle and you’ll have a better grounding than 98% of consultants."
In over a decade of consulting I have seen very, very few businesses consistently apply the fundamentals.
Every time I consult to a large business it's usually re-installing the fundamentals they lost through complexity, expansion and sabotage through boredom.
The fundamentals of a great offer.
A natural sales process.
And magnetic marketing.
Whether you're just getting started or making millions, I'm willing to bet there's a gap in the flow.
It's showing up in one of the three phases:
Not enough Sales Conversion.
Not Enough Lead Conversion.
Not enough Lead Flow.
Sales conversion is solved with the Offer Code.
Lead Conversion with Customers to Clients.
Lead flow with the Daily Client Machine.
All in the ultimate Black Friday Bundle.

performance. He recommended testing with a budget of $2,000 over three weeks to evaluate ad effectiveness.
Marketing Creativity and Customer Transformation
James discussed the challenges of maintaining creativity in marketing, noting that the rapid spread of ideas leads to market fatigue. He emphasized the importance of differentiation and originality in advertising, suggesting that taking concepts from adjacent markets or combining different ideas can be effective. James also touched on the nature of customer buying behavior, distinguishing between those seeking transformation and those looking for information. He concluded that identity and transformational experiences often have more long-term value than specific outcomes or skills.
Workshop Recording Product Strategy
Tom and James discussed the approach to creating a workshop recording product called "Map Your Customer Journey" through the DCM. James advised that info products are better suited for markets where the problem is already known, while insight-based products are more effective for educating customers about problems and solutions. They explored the differences between info and insight funnels, noting that combining both approaches can cater to different buying styles and enhance growth and scalability.
Adapting Marketing Strategies for Success
James and Shevaune discussed the challenges of marketing and selling products in a rapidly changing market. They explored how targeting specific audiences in paid ads can be less effective than reaching existing followers organically. Shevaune shared her experience with unbundling products to address customer needs more effectively. James emphasized the importance of a sustainable marketing strategy that doesn't require constant funnel rebuilding. They agreed that understanding customer needs and adapting to market changes are key to long-term success.
Hybrid Membership Model Strategies
James and Shevaune discussed strategies for client engagement and revenue generation, focusing on blending membership models with coaching to meet clients' varying needs. James shared insights from a mastermind session, highlighting how a voice coach combined annual memberships with on-demand coaching to increase revenue and client retention. Shevaune described her own transition to offering a hybrid model, providing daily voice notes, modules, and occasional calls, noting that only a small percentage of clients actively engage in calls. They emphasized the importance of understanding client preferences and offering flexible access to services, with James encouraging attendees to experiment and build on these ideas.

. I have numerous examples of people reaching out after these posts saying they changed something and got a result. ## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Problems and Plan **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the problems and plan content buckets. Problems involve addressing common audience challenges and offering solutions, while plan demonstrates leadership by outlining a clear direction and vision. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I love seeing people do this. Delivering certainty in uncertain times is crucial. The *plan* is the big daddy of content. It demonstrates leadership. To establish leadership, decide on a direction, define it, and lead others. The plan brings together all other content types. It's a demonstration of certainty. Plans require courage. They work as pillar content. I talked about my path back to $3 million a year. 10 months later, I hit it. It's a demonstration of competence and certainty. Having a plan is essential. "I'm going to do this with this many people." These are effective ways to grow an audience and be relevant. They require courage because you're exposing yourself. My client set a high profit goal. He's not hitting it, so he's writing about why and what he's doing differently. These have a soap opera element. People follow along. Taki had a plan to help 50 coaches to a million a year. It was a narrative he wove through his content. Plans can also take the form of sharing results. "7 things I learned to create a $73k MRR business." Share the insights. ## Building an Audience: Calls to Action and Content Reps **Summary:** James Kemp challenges the conventional wisdom of always including a call to action, suggesting that high-quality content often speaks for itself. He recommends starting with three content pieces per week and increasing frequency as you become more prolific. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Do you have to have a call to action? I have higher performance on posts *without* a CTA. Social media that constantly tells people to do stuff ceases to be social. If the content is good, you'll get a response. You don't need a CTA on every post. If something is time-based, a deadline, or limited spots, it's natural to point it out. What reps are required? Consistency. I write daily, so people think I'll make them do the same. If you can't do it consistently, don't do it. Start with three times a week and increase frequency when you become more prolific. Content reps build content reps. The way to write more is to write more. Establishing the skill makes it easier to deploy. There shouldn't be force in content creation. If you feel forced, narrow it down to be creative and consistent. Your results will vary. Establish a benchmark. ## Buying an Audience: The Daily Client Machine **Summary:** James Kemp discusses buying an audience through paid traffic, highlighting the potential pitfalls of generating low-intent leads. He introduces the Daily Client Machine as a solution for building an audience and converting leads into paying customers. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The third pillar is *buying*. All leads aren't created equal. You can build huge lists of unresponsive people. Paid traffic is powerful but dangerous. It can generate large volumes of low-intent leads. You build an audience, but not fans. The Daily Client Machine solves this. It builds an audience *and* partitions leads into customers. There are two components: the big idea and the customer offer. Run a simple funnel: ad to landing page to sales page. My ad: "Say goodbye to sales calls." My landing page:

> "Get the exact GDoc template that sold $802,000 of consulting without a sales call."
 80% of landing page results come from the headline. This converts at over 40%, leads are $2.50, and customer purchases pay for the ads. ## Buying an Audience: Leveraging the Daily Client Machine **Summary:** James Kemp explains how the Daily Client Machine can be used for organic growth and shares examples of its implementation, emphasizing the importance of the welcome email in setting expectations. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Get to the template, then the sales page with a customer offer. This is the most efficient way to grow an audience, leads, and convert to customers quickly. It solves the problem of thousands of leads and finding the few who will buy. Turn them into customers early. The Daily Client Machine can also grow organically. Mine go in my social media bios. I still get 20 sign-ups a day. Pay attention to the welcome email. It sets the scene and expectations, and how they can become a customer or client. These are the three ways. An audience is a long-term investment. Short-term actions create long-term results. Think long-term, but manage expectations. Returns are nonlinear. ## A Comprehensive Audience Building Plan **Summary:** James Kemp provides a practical plan for building both a large and high-quality audience, combining elements of borrowing, building, and buying. He emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective and managing expectations. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** People want instant clients from social media and ads. That's not how it works. Borrowing an audience is fastest for trust transfer, but lowest volume. A good plan: *Borrow*: Turn up twice a month to teach. *Build*: Post three times a week on primary and secondary platforms. *Buy*: Run the Daily Client Machine with a $50/day budget, two-step lead magnet, and $100 customer offer. This builds a large, high-quality audience, filters for ready buyers, creates trust transfer, and generates volume. The mixture is up to you. ## Reaching Out to Borrow an Audience **Summary:** James Kemp provides advice on how to approach someone to borrow their audience, suggesting a simple and effective script focused on offering value and demonstrating what's working now. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Everyone got the doc? Is there a script? No. 
> "I've got something cool. I'm doing this. Would it be useful if I shared it with your people?"

## Q&A: Workshopping a Product Idea (DCM) James Kemp: Hi, Tom. Tom Rolley: Hey, James, how's it going. James Kemp: Good. Tom Rolley: I was wondering if we could workshop a potential product through the Dcm Tom Rolley: and just see how you'd approach that. So the, it's a workshop recording. It was called Map your custom journey, and the purpose was to identify the constraint in the business so that they would know which thing to fix Tom Rolley: so yeah, just wondering how you'd approach that from A from this? Dcm, where do I? Where do I start? What do I build. How do I? How do I look at it to get it up? And running. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have. James Kemp: So do does the target market know what a customer journey is. Tom Rolley: Oh, gee, maybe. But probably not Tom Rolley: they. Yeah, I'm guessing they probably they're probably just overwhelmed with the amount of stuff going on in their business, and they probably wouldn't recognize that those words. James Kemp: So in the in the realm of the customer. What's the primary problem that they want solved today? Tom Rolley: I think, they're probably they're they're looking for either, increased profits or increased revenue. And then they're not sure what they're trying lots of things, but nothing much is working. And they're just unsure about what even the problem is is most likely. James Kemp: Exactly. James Kemp: That market category isn't good for info products. They're good for insight. James Kemp: Right? Once you catch their attention, you can, show how how to work those things out. And how do you get your top 3 priorities and get them a plan? James Kemp: But they're not good, for info James Kemp: info is good for people who already have James Kemp: something that they feel they need to solve. They're just looking for the the mechanism to do it. Tom Rolley: Okay. So hence, if they don't know what a customer journey is, then it doesn't make any sense for them to to. James Kemp: So the way to frame a customer related journey thing is how to get. James Kemp: how to get the the template, to send to your customers today to get 81% back into your business in the next 30 days. Right? James Kemp: Because they've the the repeat business.

 This is a sales page with insight. Sell up to the line, but make the sale via DM. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Prioritizing Life Over Business **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the Sovereign Consultant model, emphasizing the importance of building a life that a business feeds, rather than the other way around, and prioritizing intentional inputs and leverage. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The Sovereign Consultant model is about building a life that a business feeds. Most people want a good life, and the cash flow, impact, and meaning a business provides can feed that life. It's easy to stay at the surface level of strategy, but tactics and strategies alone are volatile and exhausting. Principles and philosophy guide strategy and lower volatility. My calendar demonstrates what's important to me: daily exercise, date night, family dinner, client group calls, and calls only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This creates space for creativity and flow. You don't earn the right to free space; you choose it. Intentional time management dictates results. The Sovereign way is about leverage and serving the maximum number of people. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Building a Brand **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a three-step process for building a strong brand: defining and selling a unique mechanism, crafting an aspirational identity, and building a world around your brand. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A brand is what people say about you when you're not there. The ideal brand does all the selling. Three components: world, identity, and mechanisms. Start with the mechanism – the way you get results. It needs to be unique (yours) and work. Examples: Daily Client Machine (lead magnet with a self-liquidating offer), Customers to Clients (low-ticket workshops with an offer), Hybrid Offer (selling via documents). Next, craft an aspirational identity. What does someone become when they commit to your world? JK's "Cash Creators" is a great example. Finally, world-building. People buy who you are more than what you do. World-building is an abstraction of your reality. Components: characters, language, places, storylines, memes. My world: The Brazilian, Mr. 13, Miss 7, the cat, the dog, Bali, my journey back to $3 million.

# Hybrid Offer Framework - Complete Guide

# Hybrid Offer Framework

## Overview

** This chunk acknowledges the multidimensional nature of individuals but emphasizes the importance of sticking to the core message when communicating with clients to ensure clarity and effectiveness.

## Complete Framework

Constructing Your Daily Client Machine
How To Generate Leads Hourly, Customers Daily and Clients Weekly
The Sequence - The Order of Events Matters
To hit $1m, it is critical we attack it in the right order.
The common approach is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it's to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it's skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

Template: The Offer Install™
5 4 spots available
This is only a good fit if you know what you need is a high converting offer for your audience - not more courses to watch or generic advice.
I only run my own offers to my own audience and sell them daily.
The good news for you is I will create an offer with you for your audience that I’ve previously only used to line my own pockets.
We partner by combining your delivery and audience and my offer creation skills and toolkit.
This is me, you & some Google docs and some Zoom time.
Our goal is at least $10k in new revenue.
Michael launched a new offer and made $37k in 25 days.
Zac scaled to $31k a month recurring.
Louis built up to 51 active clients.
Results are not typical but there is no cap with the right offer for your audience.
You understand over 12 weeks we install and cashflow ONE Client Offer generating at least $10k in sales.
The world is yours when you solve a specific problem for a specific person that NOBODY else can solve the way you do. You’ll be able to set your own prices, set your own terms and sell with far fewer words, less convincing and drastically shorten your sales cycle.
Together we’ll not only produce this offer, we’ll also get it “cash flowing” using my toolkit.
In Phase One we get clear on your ideal market and co-create a Client Offer that gets them a result with the minimum of you. A Client Offer is simply a $3k-$25k offer you deliver to a client that doesn’t require you swapping your time for money and can be delivered online from anywhere.
We use the Hybrid Offer™ to create simple sales while maximising lifetime value.

The 3k Code™ - Why People Buy
Assembling, Crafting and Delivering A High Converting Hybrid Offer inside The Sovereign System
The 3k Code is a prescription.
Assembled, it’s a formula.
While I give some variables and teach you how to think along the journey, results will flow from following the prescription.
My job is to give you the prescription.
This formula is designed to be tight and minimal.
It fails if you try and look for complexity or ‘more’.
Your job is to assemble, test, learn and iterate.
All results happen in the marketplace, not in the consumption of ideas.
Most people get in their own way to prevent getting in the game.
I can give you the formula but you must mix the potion and apply it.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System™
The Phases - Essential Stages of Evolution
To generate a client we can break it into phases:
Lead = Someone we’ve earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to

To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Model - Simplicity Scales
For Clients - We have one community offer and one upgrade option.
For Customers - We have one time products to generate customers and cashflow
It is offer driven.
We get Leads and turn them into Customers. We turn those Customers into Clients

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The DCM™
This system creates Leads and Customers.
You then engage with a customer to understand the intent and desire behind their action.
It creates a short term focus that is most likely to generate results over the shortest time period.
Efficiency.
It also captures those who do not display immediate intent so you can convert them into prospects via qualification/conversation or convert them into customers in the future.
The Daily Client Machine™
[There appears to be a diagram showing three connected boxes: "The Offer Code Template" -> "The Offer Code Product" -> "The Syndicate", with labels underneath: "Create A Lead" -> "Create A Customer" -> "Create A Client"]
Lead Flow vs Lead Conversion
A critical distinction in lead generation is flow vs conversion.
When people say they 'need more leads' my first goal is to determine whether they need more lead flow vs need more lead conversion.
Flow is the volume and conversion is the action.
The majority of people have a lead conversion bottleneck rather than a lead flow bottleneck.
You have enough leads, just no efficient way to convert them into customers and/or clients.
The most efficient way is to make an offer(s).. This allows the leads to self-select and demonstrate intent and narrows your focus to those who've demonstrated intent.
If you're not making enough sales yet have even a tiny audience that you're communicating with, focusing on lead conversion before lead flow will yield the highest results.
The Individual Components:

There are only two key components inside The Daily Client Machine, your Big Idea and your Customer Offer.
Armed with both you will get all the leads and customers you can handle.
The Big Idea
Illumination - Pain, Problem and Opportunity Unaware Offer: Lead Magnet Goal: Opt In
Customer Offer
Indoctrination - Pain and Problem Aware Offer: $50-$100 Digital Product Goal: Consumption and Implementation
The easiest way is to illustrate with an

Free information has a distribution advantage. Paid information has an attention advantage. Using both is a force multiplier.
The DCM 2.0™
We take the same idea and create two funnels. Each funnel leads to an offer.
The Client Funnel uses an insight path.
The Customer Funnel uses an info path.

Price Engineering
Pricing is an extensive topic that can be boiled down to a simple principle:
The lower the dollar figure we ask for today, the higher the volume achieved.
If you optimise pricing, you stand to both make multiples of your current revenue and have a higher caliber client and results.
There is no one size fits all with pricing.
Use my Office Hours to get specific help from me on your pricing.
In general; for coaching and consulting the smallest unit of time and money is the week.
Weekly pricing allows us to offer the lowest possible Now Number to a prospect.
It's easier to say yes to $300 now than $1200 now.
The Two Now Numbers to optimise for:
1. How much they pay today. 2. How much they save today.
Traditional example:
Coaching program: $1500 per month/$18k per year $17k for the year
Hybrid Program: $400 per week $17k for the year (save $3000)
When I have run these structures side by side with clients and partners, The Hybrid Offer outperforms the traditional structure by 2-3x in both conversions and cash collected.
And...having weekly recurring revenue is cashflow on steroids compared to the relative lumpiness of monthly billing.
Stacking Economics
Stacking a community with coaching, consulting and services on top just makes sense.

I use a combination of ongoing consulting, mentorship, one time consulting hours and in-person events.
1 in 3 community members buy some or all of these on joining or within the first 6

Offer Creation Using The 3 P's
These are 3 principles to get you started:
1/ Promise and Plan
The offer lives and dies on the first page. Actually, the first 3 paragraphs. Get these right and the offer sells itself.
Clearly articulating the Promise of what gets done and the Plan of how it rolls out allows the prospect to 'see' the future if they commit to buying.
This is distinct from the logistics of how and when the offer is delivered.
No one cares how many calls there are or how much coaching they get until they are committed to the result that the Promise and Plan describe.
Match this to the 'right' price and you are 80% there is having a high converting offer.
Promise
What gets done? ● What can you point at? ● Can you describe what they will see show up in their lives if they commit? ● Can you articulate in words their deepest desires better than they can? ● Bonus: What aren't they going to do and what negatives downsides are you helping the avoid?
Plan
What happens first? ● What happens next? ● What happens after that?

Have you painted a clear picture of how the next few days and weeks look like and what
they will see show up? (future pacing)
Clear beat's cute. Name and brand your systems but don't overdo it.
Price
● Have you made it easy to get started? ● Does your price factor in the cost of inaction?
Is there a clear ROI?
No one wants to watch 54 videos and attend 10 hours of calls a week.
Telling people whats IN it is more likely to kill demand than enhance it.
Examples:
The Syndicate Example
Offer conversion rate of 32% ● Average client value 121% above entry price ● Chosen to make no guarantees or promises
October 2023: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lbn2n_YYd8lPgYqvHqPoB-4p2UPkTk2ly8Q5t984c/edit?u sp=sharing
Stacking LTV
Offering upgrade options is the way to maximise revenue.
Offering TOO MANY upgrade options when presenting the offer will harm conversions.
To allow us to maximise revenue we must discern when to present them.
The checkout page is the first touch point after the offer doc.
You can add additional options that will get direct purchases, create enquiry and flag to the client that they can add additional services and access to you now or in the future.
PAYMENT
[Payment table showing:
Syndicate - $300 Weekly ($300 per week) - Quantity: 1 - Price: $300.00 ● Syndicate plus Private Slack Coaching $800 Weekly (Save $500) ($800 per week) - Quantity: 1 - Price: $800.00

The folks in The Syndicate are seeing that the model is pretty much everything.
Drop the skill into the right model and it unlocks the value.
The value is already there in your biz, it's just trapped in a sub-standard model that you've doggedly stuck to despite being stuck at the same revenue level for months.
Because a guru preached focus and shamed you away from changing it up despite it not working.
I'm not going to spend anytime 'selling you' on my model.
If you want to build a big empire with a big team you buy donuts for on Mondays then I'm definitely not your guy.
But I am willing to show you.
And short of becoming a client and joining The Syndicate (which is becoming a scarcer opportunity as I approach our 100 person limit ) what I've got for the next few days is as close as you're going to get.
Since Black Friday is coming up I'm going to use it basically give you 5 of my best trainings.
These strategies literally built this business and the folks inside my world are using them to do the same.
For the next few days or until it's sold out you can get:
The Offer Code, Hybrid Client, Customers To Clients, The Daily Client Machine and The Social Code
For $200.
These trainings will walk you through creating a high converting offer you can sell without calls, generating customers and cashflow you can turn into clients and having a flow of leads coming to you daily.

Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.

The Sovereign Brand
Size does not matter.
There is no audience too small to get traction quickly.
Actually, the smaller the better in the beginning.
The myth of needing big followings and a huge track record are just that. Myths. Sold by people
who have big followings and gate keep via experience.
You need to have solved one problem once for yourself or someone else and know how to solve
it again.
Nothing more.
A brand is the thing people say about you when you're not there.
You live rent free in someone's head and they associate you with ideas and imagery.
The end point of a brand is to promote action.
When your brand consistently sells someone on ideas and imagery it is very easy to get them to
take action.
It's the natural next step.
The ideal brand does all the selling needed.
Then when an offer is made it's the natural next step.
Creating a brand like this is not easy but it is simple.
There's 3 components:

Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it’s skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.
The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The Hybrid Offer™
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is ‘simple’, it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it’s easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.

The World you build, The Identity you craft and the Mechanisms you use.
Inside the World you build there are characters, settings, language and story lines. When a
world is in motion people can't help but pay attention.
The Identity is the one you represent yourself and the characteristics of who someone becomes
when they are inside your world. The transition and transformation of the human into their
ideals.
The Mechanisms are the way to get there. The map and the terrain of what must done for the
World to come to life and for The Identity to be manifested.
A brand can be successful with just one of these components, the best ones have all 3.
In order of fastest to slowest in terms of ROI:
1) Define and Sell Your Mechanism

The way you get results.
The only defining characteristic of your mechanism is that it needs to be unique.
It matters much more that it’s yours than what it does.
The underlying mechanism must work.
The underlying mechanism does not need to be yours.
But it must be positioned as unique and sprinkled with unique twists:
The Daily Client Machine = Lead magnet with a self liquidating offer Customers to Clients = low ticket workshops with an offer The Hybrid Offer = selling via doc
I invented none of these things. I just innovated on them and own the mechanism around them.
You don’t need many. One will do.
2) Craft An Aspirational Identity
Identity manifests from a core question:
Who does someone become when they commit to your world?
What ideal characteristics do they attain on an individual and societal level.
If we see our identity is a transaction with society then we can use currencies to define it.

The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.
There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We sign them up for an ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes and timelines along the duration.
Why People Buy
There are Four Core Reasons people buy help:
Make more money ● Save money ● Stay legal ● Live a better life
You only solve for one Core.
All other benefits are exactly that, benefits.
The difference between two companies:
Help business owners build business systems to free up time so they can make
more money (better life)
Help business owners build business systems to make more money so they can
have more time (more money)
Both businesses ‘do’ the same thing.
Yet both companies will attract a very different type of customer.
If you offer both as your core benefit both you and your client will be confused.
Personally I solve for making money.

performance. He recommended testing with a budget of $2,000 over three weeks to evaluate ad effectiveness.
Marketing Creativity and Customer Transformation
James discussed the challenges of maintaining creativity in marketing, noting that the rapid spread of ideas leads to market fatigue. He emphasized the importance of differentiation and originality in advertising, suggesting that taking concepts from adjacent markets or combining different ideas can be effective. James also touched on the nature of customer buying behavior, distinguishing between those seeking transformation and those looking for information. He concluded that identity and transformational experiences often have more long-term value than specific outcomes or skills.
Workshop Recording Product Strategy
Tom and James discussed the approach to creating a workshop recording product called "Map Your Customer Journey" through the DCM. James advised that info products are better suited for markets where the problem is already known, while insight-based products are more effective for educating customers about problems and solutions. They explored the differences between info and insight funnels, noting that combining both approaches can cater to different buying styles and enhance growth and scalability.
Adapting Marketing Strategies for Success
James and Shevaune discussed the challenges of marketing and selling products in a rapidly changing market. They explored how targeting specific audiences in paid ads can be less effective than reaching existing followers organically. Shevaune shared her experience with unbundling products to address customer needs more effectively. James emphasized the importance of a sustainable marketing strategy that doesn't require constant funnel rebuilding. They agreed that understanding customer needs and adapting to market changes are key to long-term success.
Hybrid Membership Model Strategies
James and Shevaune discussed strategies for client engagement and revenue generation, focusing on blending membership models with coaching to meet clients' varying needs. James shared insights from a mastermind session, highlighting how a voice coach combined annual memberships with on-demand coaching to increase revenue and client retention. Shevaune described her own transition to offering a hybrid model, providing daily voice notes, modules, and occasional calls, noting that only a small percentage of clients actively engage in calls. They emphasized the importance of understanding client preferences and offering flexible access to services, with James encouraging attendees to experiment and build on these ideas.

A Community product and a Consulting product.
These stack in the sense that a Consulting client gets the Community product included.
Constructing Your Products
Construction of a product is simply:
What’s in it and how long is it
What’s In It
Delivery has 3 components:
Content, Community and Customisation.
Under the Hybrid Model we provide everything someone needs to get the promised result.
The simplest model looks like this:

Those who wish to go faster, or have a higher level of access, opt for Tier 2 while getting everything in Tier 1.
You include only what is required for them to get them the Core result.
Permitted changes to delivery:
Tier 2 can include Done For You components, your existing coaching program or packages of hours.
The key is to have a product that allows for higher client value over and above the Community level.
How long is it
Your community offer is 12 months.
We get into the nuance of how to sell this next but laying out a plan allows us to maximise lifetime value on a pathway that makes sense to the prospect.

We use a Google Doc as it is fast to create, share and modify.

I have 5 years of data behind this and I’m giving you the shortcut:
Community offers at $100-$200 per week and a $3k PIF work the widest range of markets.
Consulting offers at $300-$600 sell to the right people in the right ratios.

The Menu
Growing your Community and Consulting via the Hybrid Offer is your focus for building long term value.
But having a Menu of one off or short term offers helps smooth cashflow and provide access to you during the growth phase.
For me, selling time and events are the simplest, highest value offers I can make.
Many who invest in these end up as long term clients as well.
I also have Off Menu one-to-one, partnerships and licensing that I will invite people into after they have become Clients or bought Menu items.
The Sovereign Sales (Secret)
An offer driven model is driven by….offers.
In the delivery to your Clients you are creating assets that can be used in offers.

This is an exercise in simplicity.
I hold two workshops a month for Clients.
I sell tickets to those workshops and create Customers.
I invite those Customers to become Clients. Offer driven.
I tell people I’m hosting a workshop on a valuable topic and they buy tickets:

Clients are consistently being delivered new and refined content, you build a growing library of training and templates for clients and new joiners to the community have plenty of content to solve for.

It’s the most efficient delivery
The Rhythm
Alternating between opening the community one week and selling tickets to a workshop the next can give you a very long runway before requiring structured lead generation.
If you setup a solid Sovereign Brand from the beginning, your audience will grow consistently in the course of this promotional rhythm.
The Steps

. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Understanding your core offering is crucial. Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing. ## Staying True to Your Core Message While Being Multidimensional **Summary:** This chunk acknowledges the multidimensional nature of individuals but emphasizes the importance of sticking to the core message when communicating with clients to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** You are multidimensional, but your business messaging should remain focused on your core offering. While clients can see your other facets, sticking to the core makes your message cut through the noise. Secondary benefits can enhance your offering, but the core problem you solve should be the central focus of your communication. ## The Two-Tier Client Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk prescribes a two-tier client offer structure (community and consulting/coaching) with specific pricing and client numbers to achieve an $83,000 monthly run rate. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A two-tier client offer structure can generate a million-dollar run rate. Tier two consists of 15 clients paying $600 per week, while tier one includes 50 clients paying $150 per week. This structure, combined with a $100-$150 entry-level customer offer, can generate over $83,000 in monthly recurring revenue, requiring only 1.25 new client sign-ups per week. Only 4% of customer offer buyers need to convert to clients to hit these numbers. ## Pricing Strategy: Maximizing Conversions and Economics **Summary:** This chunk discusses the tension between maximizing conversions and economics in pricing, recommending specific price points for community and consulting offers to optimize both. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Pricing should maximize both conversions and economics, which are often at odds. A recommended strategy is a $100-$200 weekly community offer with a $3,000 annual option, and consulting offers between $300 and $600. This pricing structure works across various markets. The $3,000 annual option provides higher upfront value and commitment, capturing more value than shorter-term, lower-priced options. ## The Hybrid Offer: Combining Community and Consulting **Summary:** This chunk introduces the concept of a hybrid offer, combining multiple products (community and consulting) into a single offer with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A hybrid offer combines multiple products within a single offer. For example, a $100 weekly community and a $450 weekly consulting product can be combined into one hybrid offer. This offer includes clear promises, outcomes, and timelines, unlike individual products, which primarily serve as containers for your services. This model allows clients to choose their level of access and speed of results. ## Selling the Hybrid Offer and Ongoing Commitment **Summary:** This chunk explains how the hybrid offer facilitates client acquisition by offering an ongoing commitment and allowing clients to choose their desired level of access and speed of results. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells an ongoing commitment, not fixed durations. Clients can choose higher levels of access (consulting or mentorship) while receiving everything in the base community tier. The key is a product that offers higher client value beyond the community level. This allows clients to control their access and the speed of their results, with greater access generally leading to faster results. ## The Nuance of Selling the Hybrid Offer and Maximizing Value **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of a clear plan within the offer, outlining the promise, plan, pricing, and ROI to maximize value and resonate with prospects.

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Effective offers have a clear promise, plan, and price. A strong promise outlines the specific outcome, installing a lead generation system that attracts five prospects and secures one high-value client monthly. The plan details the steps involved, developing a client roadmap and setting up a content system. This clarity allows for selling longer-term commitments (12 months) by focusing on initial, shorter-term commitments (6 weeks). ## Using Google Docs for Offer Creation and Iteration **Summary:** This chunk advocates for using Google Docs for offer creation due to its speed, ease of sharing, and modification, allowing for dynamic iteration based on market feedback. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Use Google Docs for offer creation. They're fast to create, share, and modify, allowing for dynamic iteration based on market feedback. The market writes the offer; iterate based on their feedback. This dynamic approach allows you to refine your offer until it resonates with your target audience and achieves the desired results. ## Clarity on Your Core Offering and Avoiding Messaging Confusion **Summary:** This chunk reiterates the importance of clarity on your core offering and avoiding muddled messaging, especially as your business grows and evolves. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Clarity about your core offering is paramount. It's easy to get sidetracked, but staying true to your core offering is essential for effective messaging and offer creation. Avoid muddying your message by trying to be everything to everyone. Focus on what you do best and let that clarity guide your decisions. ## Product Structure: Content, Community, and Customization **Summary:** This chunk outlines the three key components of product structure: content, community, and customization, and emphasizes the importance of a clear promise, plan, and price with a demonstrable ROI. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Products should include content (training videos), community (interaction platform), and customization (tailored access). Ensure your offer includes a promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI. If you can deliver on these elements, your offer is market-ready. Different levels of access within the product cater to varying client needs and budgets. ## Validating Your Offer and the Importance of Three Sales **Summary:** This chunk sets a validation milestone of three sales for new offers and explains how even a small network can provide valuable feedback for rapid iteration and improvement. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Aim for three sales to validate your offer. This milestone allows you to test your offer's viability and gather initial feedback. A smaller network allows for faster feedback and iteration, improving your offer more quickly through direct, real-world interaction. If 30% of people who see your offer buy it, you have something scalable

next 12 months to to achieve the dream and and then sticking to that and then being Dynamic within it to to change the order and sequence if you need to yeah we're always responsive to clients right yeah we talk about what you're making for your guys and I'm making for my guys all the time it's I feel in my Waters that they need a bit more jumping on a community call being so I saw James km say this and I'm mother no kidding but it's is so funny with business models and stuff that so so how I did it this year so this year was a reset for both of us we could do 10 podcasts about the hilarious journey of our our stories and you were selling software 5 minutes ago and not even doing consulting what I did is I did one: one first yeah and then I capped out a one to one and I'm a huge fan of telling people to at least start with something CU it is easy to sell yeah much easier when you say I'm giving you my time I'm holding your hand we're in the trenches together much EAS easier to sell than saying here's a course login all the best right it's it's easier to sell now especially when people have gone through courses and programs where they didn't get results for yes and the straight out we came out of the gate saying a similar thing which is you've done the courses you've done the programs and all you want is someone to help you assemble the good stuff yes so so what I did is it was one to one and then I filled that up and The Hybrid Offer then I was I can either just get more Ono one clients which was not appealing I could either just charge more which was appealing in the sense that I didn't want to move those 30 clients through a price increase and all that stuff and so all I did was create a community version of that and the community visual that if we just get it visual here okay so how you and I teach this right I think you call it the hybrid offer I don't have a name for it but there's one to one and the one to one that I sold was there's no curriculum so you're just getting my time there was no I think we had a slack Channel and then I built out the community and the community was half the price no one to one with me one call a week and a now a school group right so let's just say it's 1500 a month for community and 3,000 a month for one: one what's really beautiful about this particular stack is the one: one does not have a CPR group it does not have C curriculum it doesn't have separate group calls they have all the same group calls so we've got content coaching and community and this and then all that's happening is some people pay more for time with us crazy and this is what I is again it's so subjective so many ways to make money so many ways to get to 100K a month but I would say is the best way yeah yeah but but I would say what I would do is you fill your cup with onetoone clients you get insanely good at what you do controversial right I know you get you really good at what you do you charge a premium for it because you're selling a time and then you can bolt on a community you can do it either or but what I would say is if you start with a community you're not getting the rips in when it comes to Fig the the feedback loop is too long if if you got someone 10 people in a community it's harder to know how many people are winning and what they're struggling with if the only checkpoints you have is this person comes to a community call every 3 weeks right there's no oneto one chicken so I really starting one to one and going to group but here's what I would say that's where I would cap out to go to 100K a month is that you don't then

> "I want your support in getting offers pumping out cash without me having to crank the handle myself. Our goal is building a $3k offer that you take to $3k per week clockwork."
 The plan: 
> "We will install the sovereign system, talk about the client offer, customer offers, and then install the daily client machine."
 The promise, the plan, and the phases. This offer lives and dies on this page. Everything else is logistics. Price is relevant to value. $100/week. What's the risk? Weekly frame, come in, can leave. I choose no guarantees, promises, or refunds. Guarantees are a product of trust perception. The more track record you have, the less you need a guarantee. ## Maximizing Community Economics and the Hybrid Offer Approach **Summary:** James discusses strategies for maximizing community revenue, including offering annual payments with bonuses and utilizing the hybrid offer model to present multiple tiers without confusing potential clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We use the $100/week as a hook. Getting payment upfront is preferable. The average $100/week person stays 15-18 weeks, worth $1500-$1800. If we get $3000 upfront, we get cash upfront and they're more committed. I have a $3900 annual offer with a one-on-one call. This converts at 30%. To maximize conversions, I'd offer it at $2500-$3000. Offering $2500 annually is over a 50% discount. We use pricing to incentivize and collect cash. The hybrid offer sells the first tier without harming conversion to the client offer. 
> "You're receiving regular workshops and 24/7 access. Beyond that, have an option for my personal help. Members can upgrade or I can build you a custom plan to take an offer from $3k to $3k/week to $3k/day."
 The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits:

- ```txt ## Crafting a Compelling Offer **Summary:** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Welcome! Today, we'll focus on constructing your daily client machine—how to generate leads hourly, customers daily, and clients weekly. It's critical to attack things in the right order: offer, then sales, then marketing. The best way to hit a goal is to work backward from it. Create and validate an offer, make three sales with a Google Doc, create a customer offer that converts 5% of buyers into clients, and then automate lead flow, customer offers, and ascend customers into clients weekly. This system creates leads and customers, engages with customers to understand their intent, and captures those who don't display immediate intent for future conversion. The two key components are your big idea and your customer offer. The process is: lead magnet (capture and opt-in), customer offer ($100 digital product), and client offer. The big idea is a product of your client and customer offers, a frame that catches attention, creates curiosity, and establishes authority. ## Big Ideas and Customer Offers **Summary:** This chunk explores different frames for creating a big idea, including swiping, next steps, automation, and identity. It also discusses the customer offer and its role in converting leads. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Many big ideas become so successful they become the brand. Consider these frames: swiping (copy my success), next steps (your first client), automation (automatic clients), and identity (the sovereign consultant). Big ideas often have utility across multiple products (books, courses, consulting). My big idea, "selling from a Google Doc," led to a daily client machine that generates 5-10 leads daily and 1-2 product sales, doubling with simple ads. Put your big idea everywhere—social media profiles, ads. The customer offer turns leads into customers. Ideal components include training, templates, a live workshop, and a call. ## Offer Creation and Validation **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer creation, validation through market feedback, and the key principles of promise, process, and plan. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The path to a million-dollar business is simple, not easy: promise, process, mechanisms, plan, validation, sales, scale, automation. The hybrid offer is key, a single offer with multiple products. Four reasons people buy help: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Focus on one core reason; everything else is a benefit. Understand the problem/desire you're solving. Validation is getting your offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. Use the community for feedback based on real data. ## Hybrid Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk explains the hybrid offer, its advantages over traditional consulting, and provides specific pricing recommendations for community offers, consulting offers, and customer offers. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer, containing multiple products. It includes a 12-month ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Pricing examples: Community offers ($100-200/week, $3,000 annual), consulting offers ($300-600/week), customer offers ($100). This pricing maximizes conversions and economics, making it easy to get started and upgrade. ## Offer Construction Principles **Summary:** This chunk details the three core principles of offer construction: promise, process, and plan. It stresses the importance of clarity, future pacing, and avoiding information overload. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** Three principles: promise (what gets done), process (how it works), plan (how it rolls out)

. This allows clients to naturally ascend to higher value tiers based on their needs and desires for access and speed. ## Cash Velocity and Revenue Volatility: Smoothing the Path to Growth **Summary:** Kemp stresses the importance of lowering revenue volatility to reduce emotional stress and improve business performance. He recommends reverse engineering from your financial goals and incorporating one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Recurring revenue businesses are robust, but recurring revenue doesn't always arrive as expected. Lowering revenue volatility reduces emotional stress and improves operational efficiency. Reverse engineer from your financial goals and use one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue. This allows for a sustainable pace and smoother growth. ## Offer Creation and Validation: The Hybrid Offer and Client Feedback **Summary:** Kemp explains the hybrid offer model, which involves a single offer with multiple products at varying price points and durations. He emphasizes the importance of a clear promise, process, and plan, and using client feedback to refine the offer. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer. Focus on a clear promise, process, and plan, allowing prospects to envision their future. Prioritize clarity over complexity; many offers fail due to being indigestible. Validate your offer by getting it in front of 10 people and aiming for 3 sales. Use feedback, especially from those who say "no," to refine your offer. In early stages, a "no" is valuable data. ## Leveraging Existing Assets and Networks for Offer Validation **Summary:** Kemp encourages leveraging existing networks and assets for initial offer validation, emphasizing that an audience and a network are the same in the early stages. He advises testing the offer with a simple message and listening intently to prospect feedback. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** For offer validation, leverage your existing network: past clients, email lists, social media connections, current leads, partners, and personal contacts. Test your offer with a simple message, focusing on the promise and making it easy to get started. This is a listening exercise; gather data on how people respond. "Ghosting" often indicates a lack of clarity in the offer. ## Refining Your Offer: Clarity, Brevity, and Context through Content **Summary:** Kemp advises focusing offers on the client's transformation, not your own story. He stresses the importance of brevity and clarity, using content to provide context and pre-sell the process and mechanisms. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** Offers should focus on the client's transformation, not your past achievements. Brevity and clarity are key; the offer is a bridge to their future state. Use content to build context and pre-sell the process and mechanisms. By the time they reach the offer, they should already believe you can solve their problem. Focus on the promise and what happens *to them*. ## Creating Compelling Offers: Empathy, Tangibility, and Relief **Summary:** Kemp emphasizes empathy in understanding client desires, highlighting the importance of selling an experience and articulating a tangible, better tomorrow. He advises focusing on selling relief and making the offer a bridge to that relief. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** Empathy is crucial for understanding client desires. Sell an experience, not just features. Make the offer tangible by describing the physical experience of the desired outcome or the removal of the problem. Focus on selling relief—a better tomorrow—and make the offer a clear path to that relief. Tangibility and a clear vision make offers easy to sell. ## Offer Distinction and Positioning: Standing Out in Competitive Markets **Summary:** Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best

right? That is client driven by solving 20 problems along the way to get there. So they had that problem, and then they are now stretching the annualized value that, that they can ultimately achieve, and I can ultimately capture. So the earlier you are in the journey, the less buckets you want, and the smaller and the more concentrated those buckets are because you just want to fill them up. So one or two tiers is, is ultimately optimal, and I'm going to give you examples in a minute to, to show how this plays out in the, in real, the hybrid. Does that, right? So simplicity scales, and the less offers you have, the more that the offer has space to be optimized. ## Growth vs. Scale on the Path to $1 Million **Summary:** On the path to a million-dollar business, prioritize growth through experimentation and iteration. Once you have a proven offer with a high conversion rate, shift to a scale phase focused on volume. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** I've talked again a lot about the difference between growth and scale. On the road to a million dollars a year, which everybody is capable of, then you are spending much more time in growth than scale. Growth is, the metaphor is throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, right? That is how optimization happens. It happens through experiments and action and repeated actions and reps, right? In a growth phase, you never stop moving because you're always learning and iterating and trying to remove the pieces that aren't working. And then once you hit an inflection point of, I have things that work, I have an offer that when I send to people, 30% of people buy it, then you can be in a scale phase where you feed people into that and you're looking for volume. On the, on the journey up, those scale phases don't last for very long until you, you will hit a constraint or a bottleneck of diminishing returns and whether the offer or something needs slight engineering or tweaking to keep, to optimize, to ultimately grow. And those are the points where a lot of people stall out, and you'll hear people saying, "I'm stuck at X revenue. I'm stuck at this." And it's because they haven't switched from a growth phase to a scale phase, or they think they're on a scale phase, but they're in a growth phase, and they need to re-engineer the offers or some of the finances towards the marketplace. ## The Hybrid Offer and Client Value Ascension **Summary:** Use a hybrid offer and a stacked ecosystem to reveal potential ascension paths for clients. This allows clients to naturally find their value level within your ecosystem, leading to higher average client value and retention. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So how does it play out? That, that plays out in a reality that on day one of a relationship with a client, it is difficult to discern, truly discern whether a client is a thousand dollar person or a hundred thousand dollar person. The only way we, we discern that is by showing them the path to do so, right? And then the thousand, thousand, probably in hindsight, it's a bit extreme of an example. You can discern, roughly what bucket they're in, but, if you can't tell between a thousand, a hundred thousand dollar person, then there might not be enough signals to go on. So we use the hybrid offer and the stack, we can show people the potential path forward. So what I have done and what I have experimented with and nailed in my own business, and then helped people apply, is I have very power law based experience because the next step for people is always natural, so that has led to very, very high average client value

Sell up to the line, but make the sale via DM. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Prioritizing Life Over Business **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the Sovereign Consultant model, emphasizing the importance of building a life that a business feeds, rather than the other way around, and prioritizing intentional inputs and leverage. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The Sovereign Consultant model is about building a life that a business feeds. Most people want a good life, and the cash flow, impact, and meaning a business provides can feed that life. It's easy to stay at the surface level of strategy, but tactics and strategies alone are volatile and exhausting. Principles and philosophy guide strategy and lower volatility. My calendar demonstrates what's important to me: daily exercise, date night, family dinner, client group calls, and calls only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This creates space for creativity and flow. You don't earn the right to free space; you choose it. Intentional time management dictates results. The Sovereign way is about leverage and serving the maximum number of people. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Building a Brand **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a three-step process for building a strong brand: defining and selling a unique mechanism, crafting an aspirational identity, and building a world around your brand. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A brand is what people say about you when you're not there. The ideal brand does all the selling. Three components: world, identity, and mechanisms. Start with the mechanism – the way you get results. It needs to be unique (yours) and work. Examples: Daily Client Machine (lead magnet with a self-liquidating offer), Customers to Clients (low-ticket workshops with an offer), Hybrid Offer (selling via documents). Next, craft an aspirational identity. What does someone become when they commit to your world? JK's "Cash Creators" is a great example. Finally, world-building. People buy who you are more than what you do. World-building is an abstraction of your reality. Components: characters, language, places, storylines, memes. My world: The Brazilian, Mr. 13, Miss 7, the cat, the dog, Bali, my journey back to $3 million. Have fun with it (oat milk, Atomic Habits). ``` ============================================================

The Daily Client Machine 2.0
How To Generate Leads, Customers and Clients Fast
Setting The Scene: Efficient Market Dynamics
Client serving businesses are set up to… serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace will not become a client. Over a long enough time period, clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. But efficiency is finding ways to shorten time periods.
Long sales cycles suck and are hard to scale.
Therefore, we must have efficient ways to identify who is most likely to become a client as early as possible.
Plus, it’s useful to generate cashflow from those who will never become clients in efficient ways.
Traditional Lead Generation
Traditional lead generation and acquisition is a game of large numbers.
Feed 1,000 people in the top.

“Nurture” them while each one slowly drops off.
Get 30 clients out the other end—if you’re good and lucky.
There are numerous issues with this approach. It works when the cost of generating a lead is low enough to waste 97% of the product of a system.
No systems on earth that waste 97% of their output have stood the test of time.
This approach only caters to one type of buying path.
The search for “the best” funnel is an endless one when the constraints are pre-determined.

Dual Mode Client Generation
The 2.0 approach deals with reality:
What we really want is clients, not buckets of leads.
We can use those who won’t immediately (or ever) become clients to fund our marketing
to get clients.
We can monetize IP we have already built.
We can shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness
prospects.
Dual Mode means we generate Leads and Customers at the same time using the same ideas.
We make information about our system freely available to consume, then funnel the attention into action.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction (i.e., get someone to give you money).
To get money, you must gain attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Two Buying Types
We need people to consume our ideas (and us) to buy into them.
The key word is consume.
One path a buyer can take:
Consumes information
Derives insight on how it could work for them
Takes the next step and puts the insight into action
The other:

## Creating Your "Big Idea" Video (VSL) a demo of a system, the exact steps X and Y exhibit. So one of the key things here is, use the style that's native to you. My style is, I will formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver on my training. I'll formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver offers. And I'll formulate a Google Doc to also, use in my marketing. So a Google, Doc is native to the way that I work and the way I present, and the way I think. And so it's the native thing for me. I have a friend who uses, slides because that's how he does it. And he, draws on paper, and he draws on an ipad. I have a friend who goes piece straight to camera with no. no props or anything that, because that's how he does it, and that's how he delivers. And that's how his training work. So the net the native style is., is is native to you. For me, it's Google Docs, one of the dirty secrets about big ideas or Vsls, the headline drives 50% of the conversion. We only really need people to watch a couple of minutes of something to get them to take action, because the headline has framed whether they are interested and whether it's relevant to them at exact. At that exact time a lot of testing in these funnels goes back to the media, whereas the headline is the the thing that it says at the top of the page drives most of the the attention and the activity off the back of it. a demo of a system, the exact steps X and Y exhibit.

> "I've got something cool. I'm doing this. Would it be useful if I shared it with your people?"
 The "what's working now" frame is easy to sell. It's easy to sell to the audience owner and gain insight. You don't need a grand strategy. Showing what's working now is easy to sell, deliver, talk about, and convert. How do you find people with your audience? You need to be in the in-group. Be in communities this. When you've established yourself, you can answer people's questions. It's a natural stepping-off point. Most people don't contribute enough value to their communities. If you don't have people you can ask, you haven't been useful enough. The value of a community is in the value you bring. You can extract value after you've delivered it. ## The Value of Contribution in Communities **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of contributing value to communities before expecting anything in return. He shares his own experience of becoming the most useful member and reaping the rewards. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Most people's mindset in communities is "what do I get?" They close off opportunities. You have to demonstrate before you ask. People are asking, "What's in it for me?" Few give freely, so few get freely. I decided to be the most useful member of any group I joined. The more useful I became, the more I got in return. People think about what they get, not what they give. Those who give the most get the most. How do you identify true fans from a list? By making offers. I'll cover that more next week. Making offers attracts and repels. It's list hygiene. Those who aren't open will leave. They were observers, not fans. ## Refining Offers and Leveraging Paid Advertising **Summary:** James Kemp advises on testing offers organically before running paid ads, especially for new customer offers. He also emphasizes focusing on one offer and getting it right rather than creating too many different offers. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Should you test offers organically before paid ads? Yes, especially for new customer offers. If it's established, go straight to paid traffic with a lead magnet. Look for something people will engage with and buy, warm or cold. Focus on one offer and get it right, rather than creating too many. My content is coaching content. I coach through my content. I relay recent coaching sessions. It's raw and energetic. Is there a process? The key is recency. The most engaged posts followed a moment of insight. Don't hold back. Give it all away. Deliver the same ideas to your audience as to clients, just less personalized. ## Following Up After a Successful Presentation **Summary:** James Kemp suggests running a group call with a call to action for following up with a large number of leads generated from a stage presentation, rather than offering individual calls. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I jumped on stage last week. I gave it all away. I got about 300 contacts. I wanted to give more. Any recommendations for follow-up? If you have 300, I wouldn't offer individual calls. What was their hook? Doubling profits? Run a virtual session with a call to action. 
> "I spoke to you at the conference. Many are interested in doubling profits. I'm running a call next Wednesday to go deeper and offer a limited opportunity."

. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems. But don't go over the top. James Kemp: and with pricing is there a clear roi? Have you made it easy to get started? And I've done that by giving you the prescriptions of the pricing? James Kemp: And does your price factor in the cost of inaction? Have you just made it really easy to get started as the primary model? And again. this. I'm laboring this because it's a massive failure point. James Kemp: No one wants to watch 54 videos and intend 10 h of calls a week the better the client, and, the more money they have, the less time they have James Kemp: right, because more offers fail because they are indigestible rather than Lane James Kemp: telling people what's in it., all the things they get is more likely to kill demand than enhance it. Again, it's a common failure point that I see in products and offers that people are talking about all the stuff they get. James Kemp: and in and a desire to overwhelm them with value. James Kemp: And it's lazy, because if you have a clear promise and a plan, people don't need to know all the value you you deliver, they just need to get, be clear about it, so they can say yes and get started. James Kemp: So is to get some examples to bring these things together. Your next task is to construct an offer using a simple Google Doc James Kemp: syndicate folks, 95% of you should have one right now. So the reason we use a Google Doc as far as it's fast to create James Kemp: and to share and to modify. And it's most useful to demonstrate James Kemp: by examples. And I've got a template for you here as well. James Kemp: so this is an example from Jason and Janine. James Kemp: and it talks clearly about the promise James Kemp: and the plan. So the promise is. James Kemp: do you want support for me, and my incredible, incredible community can install a system that can can James Kemp: consistently attracts 5 prospects every month, securing at least one high value client every single month on your terms with the visibility you deserve, and without becoming stuck in the frustration of being the best kept secret. James Kemp: so clearly, clearly, clearly articulates what happens right? It uses numbers. It uses currency to clearly say. James Kemp: this is what's going to happen. This is what you get, and these are things you can point at James Kemp: it clearly, says that it's a 12 month program. but then it comes into over the next 6 weeks. James Kemp: and it talks about the plan will develop your client roadmap so you can. So you are faster. James Kemp: So your laser focused on who you work with. And more importantly, they'll want to work with you right? James Kemp: Then we install your product roadmap James Kemp: very clear. No cuteness. Just the client roadmap, the product roadmap, and then the IP generator system. James Kemp: So it's a great example James Kemp: of being very, very clear about the promise and the plan. and again distilling it down and removing any superfluous bits around the core. Right? Everything else in there is a benefit James Kemp: but the core James Kemp: clearly clearly articulated in the promise as something desirable, and the plan that future paces people to go through.

James Kemp: the active to the construction of it. as James Kemp: getting it out, getting it out of the way and getting it out there. That's all that matters. You can feel lots of ways about things.

And I made the offer for the first time, and it was a hot mess. But anyways. Emily Utter: as you're going through this, what I'm realizing, I think my offer. Promise still isn't clear. I'm in the make more money category. That's what I'm helping them do. But I feel my Emily Utter: angle of it. And this might be the problem I'm not sure is the self expression. love your business Emily Utter: what we did in the workshop today was, explore the different friction points all the things they don't really in the business. Right? Emily Utter: So Emily Utter: I wrote, I wrote a bunch of notes while you're talking. Can my core offer be? I help you make more money through self-expression? Or is that too nebulous? And people are fuck that, or I don't care, or whatever James Kemp: it is, pretty nebulous, how much money? What does the expression look ?

Emily Utter: no such system exists. It's Emily's bullshit meter. Put a Tm on everything, and it's a system, right Emily Utter: whatever. I think when you mentioned the bleeding confusion I was, yeah. And I think, too, most of the people who bought my workshop. And I'm sure, the first sales into this community. They're all gonna be people who've worked with me. Emily Utter: And so I've been banking on the fact that, they know, my time is worth it. And so I could call it Emily Utter: talk to Emily, and I feel those people would still buy. Maybe that's naive. Maybe I'm being lazy. And I do have my whole. Pdf, I don't know if you're open to looking at it, or I can post it, or whatever. But James Kemp: The core is, the core is making more money. Emily Utter: But the method is through James Kemp: self expression. Emily Utter: right? Right? But people aren't waking up in the night crying over their self expression. are they? Yeah? Cause. They're ashamed of making money. James Kemp: just people are ashamed of wanting good relationships or having more sex or getting better bodies when it comes down to it

- ```txt ## Defining the Sovereign Consultant **Summary:** This chunk defines the concept of a sovereign consultant, emphasizing intentionality in building a mechanism, identity, and operating world to achieve high leverage returns from a small, engaged audience. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The goal is building a million-dollar-per-year solo consultancy with 65 clients or less, working less than two days per week. This is achieved by intentionally building your mechanism, the identity people inhabit when they work with you, and the world you operate in. It's not about massive email lists or social media followers; it's about telling a compelling story to a small group. Intentionality is key to achieving high leverage returns from small audiences. You don't need huge lists, attention, or experience if you're intentional about these three categories. ## Client Acquisition Phases and Demonstrating Competence **Summary:** This chunk outlines the phases of client acquisition (lead, customer, client) and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating competence at each stage to efficiently gain clients and minimize sales pressure. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** This model is alpha-driven. A lead is someone you have the right to communicate with, a customer has transacted with you, and a client receives your dedicated time and resources. To obtain a client efficiently, demonstrate competence at each stage. While people can skip steps, a methodical sequence produces the best clients with the least sales pressure. Understanding intent and desire is crucial, and initiating a transaction is the fastest way to gauge intention.

One call a week and the training library. Russell Pearson: Yeah, okay? And currently the let's say, the payment plan is 1750. Russell Pearson: Yeah. And it's a so 21 total year.

And then I started to wonder why I didn't have any of it anymore. But then when I was on that plane, I had this level of capacity and being able to see the board in front of me that I've never had. I knew the next move. In the last few years, a lot of people have asked me, "Who's your mentor? Who are you getting coached by?" Most of those things have been very specific or spasmodic because I am… because I can see the board in front of me. I know the next move, even if I don't know what it is. I know it's there, and I know it comes. The removal of anxiety is that peeling back of… all the moves are there, and they… I can see all the concurrent timelines on how they go, and I just decide and choose, and I operate in that state. The transition from having consistent, constant anxiety… and again, we shouldn't judge any of these things, because there are our own personal semantic definitions of them. Some people have debilitating what they call anxiety, and other people just sit there with a low level of it and are not even aware of it, and it drives them. That judgment of what it is is pointless, but the removal of it allows you to tap into the flow, which says all the moves are right there, and the surrender to them, and there is no wrongness in any of it. There is no worry. There is no central thing that is catastrophic that will go wrong. ## The Body as a Supercomputer and the Importance of Raw Materials **Summary:** Our bodies function optimally when provided with the right inputs, including proper nutrition, sleep, and awareness. This allows our minds to operate at their best and align with our authentic selves. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** This resonates so much, and I would love to add a thought. My opinion is that, yes, to all that you said, and also the understanding that our body is a supercomputer and therefore it operates best when it's given the right raw material. So energy and, yes, active participants to be carrying for our mind and body. I hear you saying, though, and that might just be the story that I'm telling myself, so therefore it's true for me, because I hear you saying, not operate from a need. But what I was going to say is things the right food sources, the right amount of sleep, the right amount of awareness gives our body the raw material it needs to function at its best. So then our brain operates at its best. I love… I want to offer another analogy. Daniel Priestley gives the analogy of the David, and I had never heard that story before, but the way he says it in the 10x Is Greater Than 2x is that the creation of the David was the removal of everything that was not the David. I think when we look at us as humans, I feel sometimes it is this journey of removing everything that is not authentically true to who we are, because, I agree, I think we innately know, when we give ourselves space to be present with it, who we are called to be. We go through a process of remembering and clarifying and seeing who that is and letting go of everything that isn't part of it. ## The Light Touch of Holding Results and Avoiding Tight Grip **Summary:** Holding results too tightly, especially financial ones, can lead to their loss. A light touch and trust in the universe's balancing act are crucial for achieving desired outcomes. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Someone said to someone the other day on a private call about their holding tightness of results, their results being money.

Revenue where the payments just keep going weekly or monthly or you can just resell in another rhythm of 16 weeks I don't when people go into a month-to Monon where it's truly open-ended it's do you want to keep working together in every month you don't know where these clients are staying so having a time commitment is strong but I really having a core recurring Revenue offer that you can just resell and resell and resell again and I am a few years into this with clients where some clients have never made more than a six-month commitment and they're still here 3 years later so it totally works do it the same way in terms of going from one offer into the next CU by the way just to recap to clarify sorry these are not different offers this is not an upsell this is not a downsell this is a resell would you to continue to pay the same and experience the same level of coaching content and Community yeah that's how I do it I I we're fully on the same page with that and again it goes back to that selling once piece which is to get the transformation you want you know the dream outcome as you say it takes 12 months m in the next 16 weeks these things get done y right so they're committing to 16 weeks but they understand if they want the dream outcome they probably should be there for 12 months minimum y so I sell on two Dimensions the the time Dimensions is you're selling two time frames you're selling what happens first and then what can happen over the time frame but that's a pre it's the dream and the goal yeah right the war and the battle right yeah and then two Dimensions as well is how fast do you want to go mhm because the the the two Dimensions I sell is you can get started here for 300 bucks you get this much of me you get this this this that's enough for 66% of people but based on current numbers for the other 33% who who are in my world they're I want more access to you I want to buy hours with you I want a private sele with you so I have levels yeah that go faster let's talk about the levels well the other level that I'll go back to to the Daily client machine which is a methodology that I launched after Authority architecture that had two really distinct levels which was I'll help you write a book that you can turn into a sales funer they get you high ticket clients that was the whole premise of the daa client machine right the the course and the program of 5 grand the done for you was 50 right right so we' do we'd do the book for them launch the funnel etc etc you wrote people's books I forgot about that you're not just talking about the done for you of the selling it was so another I wanted to introduce that because another level for some people can be Services too yeah one to one services and those things but the the the point is there's power laws present in groups of customers right there is a a pretty decent cohort in most people's audiences who just want more access to you they want to go faster they want it done for them and I believe having an offer there that is multiples of the of the easy to enter $23 $400 a week piece is the fastest way to accelerate Revenue but also understand that there's different there's differing economics in your client base some people I've had people who only ever going to pay me 100 bucks and I've had people going to have pay me multiple six figures y so it's I I believe two Dimensions we're selling two dimensions of time yeah what gets done in terms of what did you say the goal yeah the the dream and the goal the Dream and the goal so sell the goal and then the dream yep and then two dimensions of this is everything that you get there's plenty there but if you want to go if you want to go faster go on the fast lane then then you can

## Q&A: Workshopping a Product Idea (DCM) James Kemp: Hi, Tom. Tom Rolley: Hey, James, how's it going. James Kemp: Good. Tom Rolley: I was wondering if we could workshop a potential product through the Dcm Tom Rolley: and just see how you'd approach that. So the, it's a workshop recording. It was called Map your custom journey, and the purpose was to identify the constraint in the business so that they would know which thing to fix Tom Rolley: so yeah, just wondering how you'd approach that from A from this? Dcm, where do I? Where do I start? What do I build. How do I? How do I look at it to get it up? And running. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have.

James Kemp: So in the in the realm of the customer. What's the primary problem that they want solved today? Tom Rolley: I think, they're probably they're they're looking for either, increased profits or increased revenue. And then they're not sure what they're trying lots of things, but nothing much is working. And they're just unsure about what even the problem is is most likely. James Kemp: Exactly. James Kemp: That market category isn't good for info products. They're good for insight. James Kemp: Right? Once you catch their attention, you can, show how how to work those things out. And how do you get your top 3 priorities and get them a plan? James Kemp: But they're not good, for info James Kemp: info is good for people who already have James Kemp: something that they feel they need to solve. They're just looking for the the mechanism to do it. Tom Rolley: Okay. So hence, if they don't know what a customer journey is, then it doesn't make any sense for them to to. James Kemp: So the way to frame a customer related journey thing is how to get. James Kemp: how to get the the template, to send to your customers today to get 81% back into your business in the next 30 days. Right? James Kemp: Because they've the the repeat business. The instant. Repeat business, template. James Kemp: how to send this, get clients. James Kemp: get money, etc. It's easy. It's, Okay. James Kemp: I want more repeat business. So I'm going to buy this, so I can use it straight away. Tom Rolley: Okay? And and that's the insight one rather than the. James Kemp: That's an info . Tom Rolley: That's the info. Okay, cool. James Kemp: With with the hybrid offer. I'm saying to people, you're selling an expensive thing on the telephone right now take this template. Put the thing you're selling into into this and sell it without the call. James Kemp: And they're, because they're they've got the thing they've got the offer. James Kemp: and they've got. They're they're running a process that they don't . James Kemp: They're doing sales calls. Tom Rolley: Okay, so where do I take that for the for this customer journey thing, should I just Tom Rolley: throw it in the bin. James Kemp: Element of the customer journey

. James Kemp: And they're, because they're they've got the thing they've got the offer. James Kemp: and they've got. They're they're running a process that they don't . James Kemp: They're doing sales calls. Tom Rolley: Okay, so where do I take that for the for this customer journey thing, should I just Tom Rolley: throw it in the bin. James Kemp: Element of the customer journey. It sounds very high level rather than . Tom Rolley: So that the the outcome is they can see the each stage of their business, and then they can clear. They ordered it and go. Oh, okay, well, we're dropping off here. that that there was, 8 18 people going into a sales call and one sale being made, and they were expecting a 30%. And so it was clear that that was the broken bit. Tom Rolley: So what do they do about that about one of them that I do. James Kemp: What do they do? Tom Rolley: What do they do? Well, then, they it's been mixed up Tom Rolley: piece rather than fixing more leads or more advertising that it was, oh, this is this is the broken bit fix that. So they they knew which bit to fix rather than just. James Kemp: A good info product zooms in on that bit. It says if people aren't turning up to your sales calls or your sales calls aren't converting at more than 30%. Do this. James Kemp: A good info product zooms in on that bit. It says if people aren't turning up to your sales calls or your sales calls aren't converting at more than 30%. Do this. Tom Rolley: Okay. James Kemp: So it talks that a good info product talks to a known problem. Tom Rolley: Okay? All right. So they have to know the problem that they've got the problem first.st And then they're, Okay, cool. This, this is the solve. James Kemp: Yeah. Otherwise, otherwise, an info product is going to spend a lot of time trying to educate people James Kemp: on that. This is the problem rather than just buying it. James Kemp: So an info product works best on a market where the the knowledge of the problem is already there. Tom Rolley: Okay. James Kemp: An insight as different because that customer journey piece James Kemp: may work very well as an insight based video which, watch this. And then you'll analyze this, and then I'll help you with James Kemp: help you with fixing that problem. James Kemp: Okay, cool. Got it James Kemp: in terms of the . If you want to know how to use that specific thing. James Kemp: That's how you'd. That's how you'd utilize it. Tom Rolley: Okay, so that would be more the Vsl, the open Vsl piece that you discussed. Okay, cool. All right. Got it. James Kemp: And then framing it. James Kemp: how we get how we double the revenue from existing customer bases without getting any new leads and and spending money on marketing, or something that. Tom Rolley: So yeah, got it. Got it? Tom Rolley: Alright. Cool. James Kemp: Because. Tom Rolley: Thank you. James Kemp: An insight based funnel will by nature educate people about, talk to pains. James Kemp: talk to problems, present solutions, and then say, do you want to fix them. James Kemp: whereas info funnel is, you've got a problem. James Kemp: Here's something that solves that problem. James Kemp: I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. You've probably got another problem James Kemp: would

. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever. And then we'll just reach James Kemp: the limitations, but would also be missing out on a ton of people who bought in a different way. James Kemp: And also we would buy, we could run, lead, lead funnels and those things all day long. James Kemp: but would also be missing out on the people who buy via an infopath and buy products and consume them, etc. Etc. And that's their buying style. Shevaune Ray: Chat too. James Kemp: And the I'm looking for things sustainable. I don't want to be building a new funnel. James Kemp: . I don't want to be building a new funnel every year. I want the core laid down, and then just reframing it, and modifying it as it goes along, rather than . Oh, my God! The webinars, died after 6 months, or the lead magnet stopped working after 3. James Kemp: That's exhausting for most people. So we need a, we need a methodology and a philosophy that's got utility. We can add different. James Kemp: We can change the video. We can change the frontier product. But. Shevaune Ray: And that's I do appreciate that. I know. I I told you that I just switched over to go high level and I appreciate that about that system is that you can set it up with multiple entry points, and all you have to change is the workflow. Instead of rewriting the whole thing. If you just want to switch something out. James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah., once, once the James Kemp: once we've got the especially the info funnel working, it's, okay, let's put some more offers on the front because the bumps the same, the membership offers the same, the upsells the same. So you're just changing out the front end. And, products, fatigue markets, fatigue, things change, and on an increasingly. James Kemp: quick basis, right? And James Kemp: AI, and these things will accelerate that because people feel that they've got much deeper, information inside than they probably necessarily have, so they'll make very good products. James Kemp: But because people are buying them, and that's proven and gpts. And these things the people who are selling them are doing very well. James Kemp: but also they're on the back end. They're tough to convert, because you've you've given every everybody, everything they needed. James Kemp: And you've you've got true cannibalization. So yeah, it's the. Shevaune Ray: Are you going to talk more about? Shevaune Ray: Were you gonna talk more about AI in this meeting? James Kemp: Not today. Shevaune Ray: Not today. That was the other call, okay? Shevaune Ray: yeah. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed

. Solve a single problem, deliver a single result. Sell them what they want, give them what they need. I trick my clients into coming by making it sound more fun. I'm a big proponent of selling the next thing, making it sound great, but delivering what they need. Magic pills sell. Frame it magically while staying ethical. If you're experienced, you can take more risks testing new ideas. I believe people's time is precious. Repurposing something you're confident about and giving it a new frame is the best way to deliver. I've delivered workshops about workshops 3 times. I find new things, so I reteach. Remember they're a small sum of the larger part. I can't help you build a sovereign business in this workshop. There's a bigger piece. Three types of workshops: demonstration (show what's working, give them the things that work), model (show the overall model, give them a plan), and mechanism (help them use the mechanism to get a result). Demonstration: show what's working, why it works, give them the things that work, and let them replicate. I want people to copy me. Model: show the overall model, give them a plan, help them envisage theirs. Mechanism: help them use the mechanism to get a result. Traffic to your sales page is warm. You don't need long sales pages. Short, punchy, bullet-pointed pages work best. The more you give to sell, the more objections. Put logistical details on the sales page. Content pre-sells the sales page. 3-7 day promotion periods work well. Most people run out of things to say before 7 days. Content builds context. By the time they get to the sales page, they're sold on the context. Your workshop depends on your delivery method. Some do slides, workbooks, docs, straight to camera. I docs because they help me think. Delivery has two parts: the vehicle (document, slides) and the conversation (Q&A). Insight can happen during or after. The replay goes into the community. If they don't join, they get it on an ungated page. Ungated means it's pirated, but it works in your favor long-term. How do you get clients? The key metric is the number of offers you make. Insert the offer briefly but carefully. Client offers convert better when offered to customers. Workshops convert better than webinars. It's easier to sell to someone who's bought before. Five touch points: 24 hours and 60 minutes before, beginning, end, and replay. If you offer a call, that's a fifth touch point. The more offers you make, the more clients you get. Three common mistakes: building a workshop a webinar, building a workshop to sell (leaving pieces out), and creating workshops when desperate for clients. Even if you don't have clients, run a workshop for an imaginary client. Focus on delivery. Results are created long-term. Good results come from giving good insights, teaching, and experiences. If you focus on delivery, then have a system to distribute it, you'll get the best results. Your marketing becomes demonstration and distribution. Most people spend 80% of their time marketing, 20% delivering. I spend 80% creating for clients, 20% productizing and monetizing. I work backwards from what clients need. There's a paradox with workshops: some of the best for clients are the worst for customers. Think about turning workshops into long-term assets the same way you think about ads. Run 10 workshops to find the one that works long-term. Judge them on three dimensions: product, delivery, and client generation. What are you focusing on? Client acquisition? Run spicy workshops that give immediate results. When upselling, send reminders 24 hours and 60 minutes before

 Modalities: Coaching (discovering answers), consulting (giving answers), mentorship (showing how). I create for my community, coach on weekly calls, consult on WhatsApp, mentor on Zoom. You can sell modalities individually or bundled into products. ## Access to Training and Classroom Content **Summary:** This chunk addresses the value of accessing all trainings and recordings within a community membership. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We've added a valuable benefit: access to all my trainings and templates. Many people want a back catalog of resources. As a community member, you get access to every recording and training. This is a key benefit of joining. ## Offer Specificity and Niche Targeting **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer specificity, avoiding trying to be everything to everyone, and targeting a specific niche. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Are you clear about your core offer? Have you defined your content, community, and customization? Have you scoped out your promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI? The weakest offers try to be everything to everyone. A clear promise is essential. Have you laid out a plan with unique mechanisms? People buy new things that solve old problems. ## Outreach Templates and Offer Sharpening **Summary:** This chunk discusses providing outreach templates and the importance of sharpening existing offers for better conversion. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** I'll be providing templates for outreach, including social posts and emails. We'll cover these in detail next week. For now, focus on your offer. Are you working on a new offer or modifying an existing one? Let's sharpen your offer for better results. ## Niche Selection and Offer Clarity **Summary:** This chunk uses a real-world example to illustrate how to refine a niche and create a compelling offer promise. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Ramzi's example of e-commerce sellers wanting to step out of their business) A niche defines the desire in the marketplace. It's a good hypothesis, but not specific enough. What will the outcome look for them? Time freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things because they're terrifying. Pre-package a vision for them.

- ```txt ## The Power of One: Building a $1M/Year Business with a Single Offer **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the simplicity of building a million-dollar online business using a single, well-crafted offer within the knowledge economy. He outlines the path, highlighting the importance of a tight, specific, and minimal offer-driven model. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The path is simple, though not easy: make a promise, define a process with unique mechanisms, create a plan, present the offer, and validate it with sales. This model allows for dynamic, fast iteration using tools Google Docs. Results happen in the marketplace, not from consuming ideas, so creating and testing offers is key. Validation means getting the offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. ## Fast and Stable Growth: Balancing Constraints and Flexibility **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of stability for rapid growth, advocating for a balance between constraints and flexibility. He emphasizes the need for underlying principles and frames to navigate uncertainty and ensure results happen *for* you, not *to* you. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The most powerful systems are both fast and stable. To move fast, you need a mix of constraints and flexibility. While certainty is unattainable, having the right frameworks and principles allows you to capitalize on opportunities and solve underlying problems. The initial setup involves defining who you are, what you do, and your target audience. ## Market Selection and Sociological Branding: Prioritizing Your Energy **Summary:** Kemp explains the importance of market selection, advising to be close to money for greater financial success. He contrasts sociological branding (prioritizing your energy and desires) with psychological branding (catering to market demands). Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Your market choice significantly impacts your financial results. Being close to money—its creation, discovery, keeping, and transfer—increases earning potential. However, market selection should align with your desires, skills, and market permission. A sociological business prioritizes your energy and interests, attracting -minded individuals through natural polarization. This contrasts with psychological businesses that chase market demands, often becoming chameleons. ## Building Your Brand: Mechanism, Identity, and Transparency **Summary:** Kemp highlights the importance of a unique mechanism, a clear identity, targeted content, and transparency in building a compelling brand. He advises actively repelling those who aren't your ideal clients and focusing on total, honest communication. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Key elements for a successful brand include a unique mechanism, a defined client identity, content showcasing your past, present, and future, and clear messaging that repels those you don't serve. Transparency is crucial in a low-trust environment. Total, honest communication trumps polished copywriting; authenticity attracts the right people. ## Client Value and Power Laws: Maximizing Revenue and Retention **Summary:** Kemp introduces the concept of power laws in client relationships, emphasizing that not all clients are equal. He advocates for focusing on annualized client value and creating an ecosystem that allows clients to find their natural spending level. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Power laws dictate that a small percentage of clients contribute a large percentage of income. Ignoring this leads to diminishing returns and burnout. Focus on annualized client value and create an ecosystem with revenue buckets. This allows clients to naturally ascend to higher value tiers based on their needs and desires for access and speed. ## Cash Velocity and Revenue Volatility: Smoothing the Path to Growth **Summary:** Kemp stresses the importance of lowering revenue volatility to reduce emotional stress and improve business performance. He recommends reverse engineering from your financial goals and incorporating one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan

. So we use the hybrid offer and the stack, we can show people the potential path forward. So what I have done and what I have experimented with and nailed in my own business, and then helped people apply, is I have very power law based experience because the next step for people is always natural, so that has led to very, very high average client value. And that's also led to very high retention because I have a myth, a methodology which allows people to naturally move forward to the place that they need to be, but also naturally move backwards to settle at a level without them ultimately leaving a community or a product or, etc. And saying in other ways, I've worked out how to get the most amount of money out of clients while delivering, out of clients for delivering the maximum result. And I've also worked out a way to pretty much ensure that most people don't leave because they have something for them. So scenario one, a common scenario: They join the community, they pay in full off the back of, an offer, they enjoy the experience, I credit that experience against the syndicate, and they step up into it. I credit the full experience. I work out a custom payment for them based on the credit, so they're not paying the full amount. They feel that they've got a credit, which is again potential energy in there, and they step up into the syndicate, and they're on a lower payment than they would be at a market rate, and they've got that natural experience. That is a very common flow, just by crediting what someone has previously purchased against the next step. Right? And I'm in the process of engineering that across the board in the business to make that natural. So anybody, no matter how long they've been in there, can benefit from, from that progress in that state, so they can settle in their naturals, in their natural place. That also, this also means that in the inverse, that someone could join the syndicate for a period of time and step back down to the community because under the, the nature of that offer, they might spend 3 months in the syndicate, and then they step down, and they've still got, 9 or 8 months, in the community, and they're still ultimately there and part of it. Right? ## Leveraging Small Initial Investments for High Client Value **Summary:** By strategically structuring your ecosystem and crediting previous purchases, you can transform small initial commitments into significantly higher value client relationships. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So this is another scenario that's played out. And so that, that scenario there has an annualized value of about $20,000 for a person if they stay for the whole duration of that. that's the, the actual ultimate example. Bear in mind, the first touch point that that person had when joining my world was they were probably attracted by someone, something that said, "Join for a hundred dollars." So I have taken that commitment or that interest of a figure around a hundred dollars and then established that the client will spend $20,000, right? There's an order of magnitude different in the actual client value. And this is why we isolate that when we look at offers, we isolate the ability to convert someone versus having an ecosystem that they step into where they ultimately expand. There are plenty of people who have gone through the classic ascension from me, who have downloaded a free lead magnet, bought a $10 book, joined $100 a week community, and then ascended all the way up to the Circle at $800 a week. So again, same scenario, client joins the community, then moves between levels based on how much proximity and access they need at the time. And again, this is a real scenario

## Components

### ```txt ## Defining the Sovereign Consultant **Summary

** This chunk defines the concept of a sovereign consultant, emphasizing intentionality in building a mechanism, identity, and operating world to achieve high leverage returns from a small, engaged audience. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The goal is building a million-dollar-per-year solo consultancy with 65 clients or less, working less than two days per week. This is achieved by intentionally building your mechanism, the identity people inhabit when they work with you, and the world you operate in. It's not about massive email lists or social media followers; it's about telling a compelling story to a small group. Intentionality is key to achieving high leverage returns from small audiences. You don't need huge lists, attention, or experience if you're intentional about these three categories. ## Client Acquisition Phases and Demonstrating Competence **Summary:** This chunk outlines the phases of client acquisition (lead, customer, client) and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating competence at each stage to efficiently gain clients and minimize sales pressure. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** This model is alpha-driven. A lead is someone you have the right to communicate with, a customer has transacted with you, and a client receives your dedicated time and resources. To obtain a client efficiently, demonstrate competence at each stage. While people can skip steps, a methodical sequence produces the best clients with the least sales pressure. Understanding intent and desire is crucial, and initiating a transaction is the fastest way to gauge intention. An offer-driven model provides a clear next step for prospects. ## The Client World Structure: Community and Consulting Levels **Summary:** This chunk details the tiered structure of the client world, including community and consulting levels, and explains how a seven-figure run rate can be achieved with just these two tiers. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The client world consists of a community level, a consulting level, and optionally, a mentorship level. The mentorship level isn't necessary for a seven-figure run rate. The community level provides a broad base, while the consulting level offers more intimate, high-access service. A menu of offerings allows for varied sales and delivery. For example, a sovereign community might cost $100 monthly with a $3,000 annual option, alongside other higher-priced group programs and consulting hours at a premium rate. ## Core Reasons People Buy Help and Focusing on One **Summary:** This chunk identifies the four core reasons people buy help (make more money, save money, stay legal, live a better life) and stresses the importance of focusing on just one core reason for business clarity and effective messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** There are four core reasons people buy help: make more money, save money, stay legal, and live a better life. Focus on solving for only one core reason; all other benefits are secondary. Focusing on a single core helps refine messaging, offers, and target audience, leading to greater clarity and effectiveness. While secondary benefits can attract and retain clients, a clear core problem is essential. Losing sight of this core can lead to confused messaging and a diluted brand identity. ## Understanding the Client's Problem and Solution **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of understanding how the core problem manifests in clients' lives, their awareness of it, and their current solutions to effectively tailor your unique solution and messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Understanding your core offering is crucial. Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing

## Complete Framework

$100 Workshops
How To Generate Customers, Cashflow and Clients With $100 Workshops
Workshops Work:
The simple definition of a workshop is a live call where something gets done.
Workshops combine information and insight.
How something is done - information How it can work for an individual attendee - insight
Where to create from:
Solve a single problem, deliver a single result ● Clients first, customers second
[Workshop Calendar - October 2024 Schedule Placeholder]
The workshops you create are useful for clients. I will reiterate this regularly...
How to create it:

Magic pills sell in large numbers ● Reminding is more useful than teaching
The best workshops are self-contained. They give everyone a result no matter if they decide to become clients or not. While tempting to leave something out this manipulation comes back in the future.
The best clients understand the value of proximity and insight. They get the information in the workshop and
Most people feel they will be fine with information. The majority will leave and do nothing with it. Some will leave, try to execute it, see it work for them and want more or will see it's harder than it looks and will come back.
The duality of good workshops is that the more you create for clients the more sales you make to customers who are best fit clients.
Said another way, the less sales you try and make the more sales you will make.
The Two Frames
This Is Part Of Client Delivery:
"Welcome to our guests, this workshop is for my clients" Allowing people to understand that this workshop is being held as part of your normal delivery allows them to see and imagine a world they might like to be part of.
Small Part Of Something Larger:

Whether your workshop is demonstration, model or mechanism based it will only cover a small part of your world. Show how it fits into the big picture.
Eg workshops are one component of the Sovereign Blueprint they work alone but work better when you have a great Client offer.
The Power Ladder
The realities of market dynamics can frustrate or be embraced.
Not everybody is going to buy your stuff. In fact, very few will.
The key to leverage is identifying who is likely to firstly, buy, then who will make a custom of buying (customer) and who would find further access to you useful (client)
The Power Ladder™
Understanding market dynamics and sophistication allows you to meet the right person with the right offer to generate insight for their specific stage of growth
What people say and what people do are very different things.
Many people in your addressable market can intend to work with you in the future. Hanging on this hope will sustain you for a little then depress you when it's not fulfilled.

Many businesses go crazy and broke trying to 'educate' and 'nurture' their market when making an offer presents the simplest shortcut.
The strongest intent demonstration is the act of purchasing. This gives you a signal to tune into and explore the intent behind that commitment.
The Sovereign Blueprint
Built on The Sovereign Principles and deploying the correct modality via the correct channel:
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them. ● Consulting - Giving someone the answer. ● Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it ● Creator - Conjuring of original ideas ● Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
If, then:




If I share good content on social and make it easy and natural to join my email list I will grow my leads daily. If I create great workshops for clients then customers will purchase them and a few will naturally see that it's worth joining The Syndicate. If I make it easy to get started in The Syndicate with pricing economics I will maximize client experience and LTV naturally by unbundling and having dynamic offers. If I build a great client base and establish great relationships, I will naturally find those who value being coached in The Circle.

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.

Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

These are sample emails promoting a black Friday sale. The tone, structure, and value provided in each of these emails are what I want to model in the Fire Yourself Series black friday/cyber monday deal.

Subject: This Is Very Simple Body:
5 weeks ago I told you exactly what my plan was:
My 5 Step Devious Plan to $10k a day:
1) Start community where I can full send everything I know about building a silly profitable consulting business on your lonesome. Cap at 100.
2) Run workshops every second week for community with said strategies, sell tickets to workshops I'm doing anyway for $100-$300
3) 3 outcomes: People like workshop and want to work with me, join community/people get value, execute themselves/people don't like get refund (hasn't happened yet)
4) Invite true savages to inner circle and help them build to $100k profit per month. Document journey for proof. Cap at 12.
5) Repeat.
And I'm very close to getting there.
(upon which point I have a new plan:) )
We've got 76 out of 100 spots filled in The Syndicate and I closed another intake today.
My Sovereign Circle has 8 great peeps in it.
And over 560 have attended or had access replays and resources of my workshops.
Along the way I've shown you exactly how I'm doing this.
Literally let you look over my shoulder.
And the funny thing is a One Man Band business that does $3m a year in profit is available to you and you only need one key skill.

The 3k Code™ - Why People Buy
Assembling, Crafting and Delivering A High Converting Hybrid Offer inside The Sovereign System
The 3k Code is a prescription.
Assembled, it’s a formula.
While I give some variables and teach you how to think along the journey, results will flow from following the prescription.
My job is to give you the prescription.
This formula is designed to be tight and minimal.
It fails if you try and look for complexity or ‘more’.
Your job is to assemble, test, learn and iterate.
All results happen in the marketplace, not in the consumption of ideas.
Most people get in their own way to prevent getting in the game.
I can give you the formula but you must mix the potion and apply it.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System™
The Phases - Essential Stages of Evolution
To generate a client we can break it into phases:
Lead = Someone we’ve earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to

To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Model - Simplicity Scales
For Clients - We have one community offer and one upgrade option.
For Customers - We have one time products to generate customers and cashflow
It is offer driven.
We get Leads and turn them into Customers. We turn those Customers into Clients

The Sovereign Consultant - The Simplest Path to $1m
The Sovereign Path
The model you choose dictates how you spend your time, energy and the results you ultimately generate for yourself and others.
If it’s not the biggest decision you make, it’s close.
The Sovereign is a model for now.
Intentional, lean and flexible.
It’s less about building a business and more about building a life that a business feeds.
The Space Strategy is attractive because it’s tangible and can offer the lowest cognitive load. It’s simply a series of tasks. Purely operating at a strategic level will be highly volatile and exhausting as the rate of change is high. High rates of change induce high rates of anxiety.
Anxiety is destructive for life and business.
Principles require thought and consistency. They can guide strategy and lower the volatility as they evolve more than change.
Philosophy has the lowest rate of change. It morphs and evolves but the fundamental beliefs change very, very slowly.
Your personal philosophy is the strongest platform to build on.

Show me your calendar and it will tell me what is important to you.
Without a personal philosophy, an approach to life, you will be blown about by the whims of change.
It’s easy to say a certain thing is important to you but how you spend your time actually demonstrates what is important to you.

To live intentionally and live what’s truly important to me I must create time to feel, think and create.
Time and Values Constraints:
Have dinner with my children everyday ● See my kids before they leave the house everyday ● Move everyday
Translates to:
Non-negotiables - daily exercise, date night, family dinner together ● Essentials - client group call weekly ● Flow - Calls only on Tues and Thu Mornings
The Sovereign World has very, very high rates of leverage.
All inputs are intentional and it does not require much time to ‘run’.
But the space is where you and

Customers To Clients How To Generate Customers, Cashflow and Clients Fast The Power Ladder The realities of market dynamics can frustrate or be embraced. Not everybody is going to buy your stuff. In fact, very few will. The key to leverage is identifying who is likely to firstly, buy, then who will make a custom of buying (customer) and who would find further access to you useful (client) What people say and what people do are very different things. Many people in your addressable market can intend to work with you in the future. Hanging on this hope will sustain you for a little then depress you when it’s not fulfilled. Many businesses go crazy and broke trying to ‘educate’ and ‘nurture’ their market when making an offer presents the simplest shortcut. The strongest intent demonstration is the act of purchasing. This gives you a signal to tune into and explore the intent behind that commitment. My Business Model - August 2023 Built on The Sovereign Principles and deploying the correct modality via the correct channel: Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them. ● Consulting - Giving someone the answer. ● Mentorship -Showing someone how I would do it ● Creator - Conjuring of original ideas ● Curator - Assembly of the best ideas If, then: If I share good content on social and make it easy and natural to join my email list I will grow my leads daily If I create great products for clients then customers will purchase them and a few will naturally see that it’s worth joining The Syndicate If I make it easy to get started in The Syndicate with pricing economics I will maximize client experience and LTV naturally by unbundling and having dynamic offers. If I build a great client base and establish great relationships, I will naturally find partners to work with for a very long time Products: Dynamic Products Economics: Dynamic Pricing Dynamic pricing allows the highest flexibility for clients to choose the speed they move at. More access allows more speed. Observations: Adding 1:1 component is the fastest route to raise LTV for those with group programs ● Using pricing economics weekly pricing is the fastest route to increase volume for group programs The Flow: From Customer to Client 1. Create an offer and sell it to your audience 2. Deliver the offer and invite those who purchased it to become clients 3. Profit Creating A Customer Offer A customer offer simply creates a customer via a purchase. The price is not irrelevant but it’s relatively unimportant. The act of purchasing at any dollar value is a trust signal. Ideal Components 1. Training and Templates 2. Live Workshop 3. Call (if looking for volume) Choosing It Guidelines: Solve a single problem, deliver a single result ● Sell them what they want, give them what they need ● Magic pills sell in large numbers ● Repurpose - use something you’ve already created ● Small sum of larger part Behind The Offer Code: Having a great offer that’s easy to sell and easy to buy is essential to businesses <$3m. Knowing this indicates a moderate to high sophistication level. I felt an offer training and templates would be a good lead offer as I opened up The Syndicate as it appeals to people who largely already have offers and would to optimise them. It is also one of the key things we do inside The Syndicate as great offers are the driver of great businesses. It plays to my strengths, has a high ROI potential and I had massive amounts of proof that the contents of the training was proven and effective. Selling It: 40/40/20: 40% - How desirable the offer is to your audience 40% - The scarcity and deadline you place on it 20% - Your messaging and marketing After the offer selection, the primary driver is scarcity and urgency. If you have these present, it will do most of the heavy lifting

The Sequence
The common approach is to work ‘forwards’ from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it’s to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
At a strategic level, we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Promote Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly

The Sovereign Brand
Size does not matter.
There is no audience too small to get traction quickly.
Actually, the smaller the better in the beginning.
The myth of needing big followings and a huge track record are just that. Myths. Sold by people
who have big followings and gate keep via experience.
You need to have solved one problem once for yourself or someone else and know how to solve
it again.
Nothing more.
A brand is the thing people say about you when you're not there.
You live rent free in someone's head and they associate you with ideas and imagery.
The end point of a brand is to promote action.
When your brand consistently sells someone on ideas and imagery it is very easy to get them to
take action.
It's the natural next step.
The ideal brand does all the selling needed.
Then when an offer is made it's the natural next step.
Creating a brand like this is not easy but it is simple.
There's 3 components:

speed creation and selling ✓ A peek behind the scenes into my first offer that generated $1.3m in sales in 13 months ✓ The 'laws of pricing' and why breaking them will kill your offer dead ✓ How to generate millions from a simple Google doc ✓ The word for word template that generated $605,000 in sales without a single call ✓ The exact copy paste template that sold a $15,000 year long mastermind ✓ Step by step walkthroughs of proven offers you can swipe today

Creating A Customer Offer
A customer offer simply creates a customer via a purchase.
The price is not irrelevant but it's relatively unimportant. The act of purchasing at any dollar value is a trust signal.

Money. Time. Energy.
Universally valuable currencies.
Crafting an Identity steers people through ideas towards offers.
Selling them on who they can become if they come inside.
There are layers of specificity here.
If you use concepts that you can point at then the ideas are stickier.

3) Build A World
World building is the demonstration and dramatization of the world you live in.
It’s an abstraction to varying degrees of your reality.
How much of an abstraction is personal preference.
If you get too far away from reality then you are playing a character which can be exhausting for many.
There must be some substance behind the world otherwise it is a fairy tale and fairy tales always end.
The core components of World building are:

Characters - Who inhabits your world ● Language - What unique or distinguishing language is used (ideally crosses over with mechanisms)
Places - The locations and environments that it takes place in
The world is communicated through:
Story Lines - consistently communicated open loops ● Memes - consistently communicated ideas
My Characters: The Brazilian, Mr 13, Miss 7, The Cat, The Dog.
My Language: Customers, Clients
My Places: Bali, Planes, The Villa
My Story Lines: Simplifying after separation, solo Dad, road to $3m
My Memes: Oat milk, Atomic Habits

The Sovereign Stack
We’ve setup the platform.
Now we need offers to monetise and deliver.

The Sovereign Stack
We’ve setup the platform.
Now we need offers to monetise and deliver.

This is an offer driven model.
To generate a client we can break it into phases:
Lead = Someone we’ve earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
Zooming in to The Blueprint:

My example for reference:
The Core
There are Four Core Reasons people buy help:

The Menu
Growing your Community and Consulting via the Hybrid Offer is your focus for building long term value.
But having a Menu of one off or short term offers helps smooth cashflow and provide access to you during the growth phase.
For me, selling time and events are the simplest, highest value offers I can make.
Many who invest in these end up as long term clients as well.
I also have Off Menu one-to-one, partnerships and licensing that I will invite people into after they have become Clients or bought Menu items.
The Sovereign Sales (Secret)
An offer driven model is driven by….offers.
In the delivery to your Clients you are creating assets that can be used in offers.

This is an exercise in simplicity.
I hold two workshops a month for Clients.
I sell tickets to those workshops and create Customers.
I invite those Customers to become Clients. Offer driven.
I tell people I’m hosting a workshop on a valuable topic and they buy tickets:

Clients are consistently being delivered new and refined content, you build a growing library of training and templates for clients and new joiners to the community have plenty of content to solve for.

It’s the most efficient delivery
The Rhythm
Alternating between opening the community one week and selling tickets to a workshop the next can give you a very long runway before requiring structured lead generation.
If you setup a solid Sovereign Brand from the beginning, your audience will grow consistently in the course of this promotional rhythm.
The Steps

- ```txt ## Defining the Sovereign Consultant **Summary:** This chunk defines the concept of a sovereign consultant, emphasizing intentionality in building a mechanism, identity, and operating world to achieve high leverage returns from a small, engaged audience. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The goal is building a million-dollar-per-year solo consultancy with 65 clients or less, working less than two days per week. This is achieved by intentionally building your mechanism, the identity people inhabit when they work with you, and the world you operate in. It's not about massive email lists or social media followers; it's about telling a compelling story to a small group. Intentionality is key to achieving high leverage returns from small audiences. You don't need huge lists, attention, or experience if you're intentional about these three categories. ## Client Acquisition Phases and Demonstrating Competence **Summary:** This chunk outlines the phases of client acquisition (lead, customer, client) and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating competence at each stage to efficiently gain clients and minimize sales pressure. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** This model is alpha-driven. A lead is someone you have the right to communicate with, a customer has transacted with you, and a client receives your dedicated time and resources. To obtain a client efficiently, demonstrate competence at each stage. While people can skip steps, a methodical sequence produces the best clients with the least sales pressure. Understanding intent and desire is crucial, and initiating a transaction is the fastest way to gauge intention. An offer-driven model provides a clear next step for prospects. ## The Client World Structure: Community and Consulting Levels **Summary:** This chunk details the tiered structure of the client world, including community and consulting levels, and explains how a seven-figure run rate can be achieved with just these two tiers. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The client world consists of a community level, a consulting level, and optionally, a mentorship level. The mentorship level isn't necessary for a seven-figure run rate. The community level provides a broad base, while the consulting level offers more intimate, high-access service. A menu of offerings allows for varied sales and delivery. For example, a sovereign community might cost $100 monthly with a $3,000 annual option, alongside other higher-priced group programs and consulting hours at a premium rate. ## Core Reasons People Buy Help and Focusing on One **Summary:** This chunk identifies the four core reasons people buy help (make more money, save money, stay legal, live a better life) and stresses the importance of focusing on just one core reason for business clarity and effective messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** There are four core reasons people buy help: make more money, save money, stay legal, and live a better life. Focus on solving for only one core reason; all other benefits are secondary. Focusing on a single core helps refine messaging, offers, and target audience, leading to greater clarity and effectiveness. While secondary benefits can attract and retain clients, a clear core problem is essential. Losing sight of this core can lead to confused messaging and a diluted brand identity. ## Understanding the Client's Problem and Solution **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of understanding how the core problem manifests in clients' lives, their awareness of it, and their current solutions to effectively tailor your unique solution and messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Understanding your core offering is crucial. Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing

. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Understanding your core offering is crucial. Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing. ## Staying True to Your Core Message While Being Multidimensional **Summary:** This chunk acknowledges the multidimensional nature of individuals but emphasizes the importance of sticking to the core message when communicating with clients to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** You are multidimensional, but your business messaging should remain focused on your core offering. While clients can see your other facets, sticking to the core makes your message cut through the noise. Secondary benefits can enhance your offering, but the core problem you solve should be the central focus of your communication. ## The Two-Tier Client Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk prescribes a two-tier client offer structure (community and consulting/coaching) with specific pricing and client numbers to achieve an $83,000 monthly run rate. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A two-tier client offer structure can generate a million-dollar run rate. Tier two consists of 15 clients paying $600 per week, while tier one includes 50 clients paying $150 per week. This structure, combined with a $100-$150 entry-level customer offer, can generate over $83,000 in monthly recurring revenue, requiring only 1.25 new client sign-ups per week. Only 4% of customer offer buyers need to convert to clients to hit these numbers. ## Pricing Strategy: Maximizing Conversions and Economics **Summary:** This chunk discusses the tension between maximizing conversions and economics in pricing, recommending specific price points for community and consulting offers to optimize both.

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The Sovereign Consultant model is about building a life that a business feeds. Most people want a good life, and the cash flow, impact, and meaning a business provides can feed that life. It's easy to stay at the surface level of strategy, but tactics and strategies alone are volatile and exhausting. Principles and philosophy guide strategy and lower volatility. My calendar demonstrates what's important to me: daily exercise, date night, family dinner, client group calls, and calls only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This creates space for creativity and flow. You don't earn the right to free space; you choose it. Intentional time management dictates results. The Sovereign way is about leverage and serving the maximum number of people. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Building a Brand **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a three-step process for building a strong brand: defining and selling a unique mechanism, crafting an aspirational identity, and building a world around your brand. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A brand is what people say about you when you're not there. The ideal brand does all the selling. Three components: world, identity, and mechanisms. Start with the mechanism – the way you get results. It needs to be unique (yours) and work. Examples: Daily Client Machine (lead magnet with a self-liquidating offer), Customers to Clients (low-ticket workshops with an offer), Hybrid Offer (selling via documents). Next, craft an aspirational identity. What does someone become when they commit to your world? JK's "Cash Creators" is a great example. Finally, world-building. People buy who you are more than what you do. World-building is an abstraction of your reality. Components: characters, language, places, storylines, memes. My world: The Brazilian, Mr. 13, Miss 7, the cat, the dog, Bali, my journey back to $3 million. Have fun with it (oat milk, Atomic Habits). ``` ============================================================
