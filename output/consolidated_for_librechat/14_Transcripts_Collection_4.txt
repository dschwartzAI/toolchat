# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 17

autopilot or :11 there was the playing of a character anything that always I want to come back to what you just said because I I was on the inside of that as :18 well so I want to give perspective on your side if I can go for it but :23 the in hindsight yes there was there was just that curse of :29 Competency that allowed everything to just to keep rolling on despite a feeling of disease that :36 permeated large Bits Of My Life that this is this it was the a :44 feeling for a decent part of the last of the last year last a couple of a year or two ago :51 and in that period so there was definitely things that I ignored but I :57 could put them away because I do have a high pain threshold I have a :03 tolerant I have the tolerance of lots of entrepreneurs have because we can tolerate things that other people can't :08 and we just normalize it and I saw you go through that I saw you knowing that you needed to :14 stop and slow down and and focus on yourself and you were saying to me at the time :19 that you knew you did it but you didn't feel able to because :25 we were both playing characters of we need to do this because there's some :32 higher power mummy and daddy coaching issue or Mentor Mentor issues to say :38 what would they think of us if we pulled the plug on this 13-person business what would they think of us if we pulled the :44 plug on this 25-year relationship and 15-year marriage so :49 all the evidence is there for us and we we often know :55 it's the difference between knowing and knowledge right yeah we know our bodies are telling us yeah the :01 level that I've talked about with you about my sleep issues and those things for :06 most of last year I sleep a baby now most of the :12 last year I didn't yeah there's this karmic Force waking you up at three o'clock in the :18 morning telling you that something's off yeah and I just ignored all the signs yeah and I think you you recognize bits :24 of that that there was stuff there that was this is the signal this is a signal this is it's not noise yeah just :31 to to to say that something needs to change it's identifying the changes is the biggest challenge :37 and we can't do that ourselves we sometimes fear is very difficult anyway :42 it sometimes fear looks wisdom right so when you have a team :47 and it might not even be oh what will people think it's these people have jobs and if I don't have this :54 business they don't have a job I'm morally obligated to do that right yeah and so for me there was also that layer :00 of I was so concerned about everyone else's health and safety it's :05 that metaphor of who's whose mask do you put on first for me I felt so indebted :11 to these people on my team that I felt indebted to the clients that entrusted their hard-earned money into :17 this business model that I'd created that I was if I step out of this model I might be serving myself but I'm :24 doing a disservice to everyone else and even as it turns out that's not what happened people found better jobs :31 clients love the transition right but the reality is of you you live with that weight and it's it it's I don't :38 want to oversimplify it but so much of human nature and so much of the decisions we find ourselves making really comes down to are we being :45 influenced by external forces or are we being our intentions moving us internally to do things and :52 make things happen and so the authenticity Journey for me has been really interesting because I stripped it :58 back to to nothing and I was playing around with those ideas of okay so you have all the money in the :04 world what do you want

:38 want to oversimplify it but so much of human nature and so much of the decisions we find ourselves making really comes down to are we being :45 influenced by external forces or are we being our intentions moving us internally to do things and :52 make things happen and so the authenticity Journey for me has been really interesting because I stripped it :58 back to to nothing and I was playing around with those ideas of okay so you have all the money in the :04 world what do you want to wake up and do and as I was giving myself permission with without putting the :09 expectations of I but I run a team of all these people and but I'm working with Alex and what will he :14 think it became so freeing because I was man I think I'm really :19 clear on on who I am and who I want to be and I'm not running a business that reflects that but it took me deciding :26 that my health was most important that my passion was most important that I I couldn't just keep upping my my pain :33 threshold and keep enduring more to for everyone else's sake I had to really look after myself not just from a :40 physical mental emotional health objective but but for the longevity of my life I'm gonna die at some point :47 I have no idea when my life is going to end I hope when it does I can look back on the seasons that I've been living at :54 going I've been living true to who I am yeah I've been playing this mimicry of trying to be :00 this coach or this coach but I was living the best way I damn could to be Dan Bolton to be the truest version of :06 who I am and that became It came it came because I hit the pain threshold of :13 I can't be this other person that other people that I feel other people need me to be it sounds this year's :19 been formative for you in that way as well yeah yeah again you you just can't again the consequence piece of :26 if I am and continue to be that or if I continue to pretend then the the :31 cost is coming into view which is probably what you felt as well if I keep doing this :37 bad things are going to happen and I think authenticity I again it's one of those words that :45 has been bastardized a bit because authenticity means to lots of people just share stuff on the :52 internet to manipulate people yeah whereas true Earth intensity is living :59 your own life but also understanding that evolves yeah the Dan Bolton of today :06 is not even the Dan Bolton even tomorrow yeah right but they're still the same they're still the same entity :12 yeah and going forward that this person is authentic if you're evolving authentically based on the a :18 small number of things that are important to you then it's still you yeah but this is what I find interesting :23 about evolution is that we I :29 remember having a conversation with Liv a few years ago and I was I just want to become a :35 new Dan Bolton I want to become Dan Bolton 2

.0 and then I sat there I thought about it and I was :41 am I becoming new Dan Bolton or am I becoming true Dan Moulton now funny play on words but for me what's really :47 interesting is if I think about who I was as an 18 year old I'm more reflective of the 18 year old now :54 and this season than I have been for the last five years because I deviated so far from the values of the vision that I :00 had for my life now this is of course not true at every age I can't look back at Dan Moulton at seven dead :06 multiple seven wanted to be a backup dancer in the Spice Girls 100 True got my mum to call the travel agents to :14 figure out how much it would cost to fly to the UK you took action you're an action taker The Action preseason :21 already believe in my ability to figure it out but when we look at overall I'm gonna make that dream come true for you one day I promise please bring back the :29 reunion when we look over the our lives there is so much breadcrumbs as :34 to who the true version of us is yeah definitely so Evolution we think about it in terms of the self-creation but :40 it's almost the self-discovery of the person that was always there I think Michelangelo carved David is that is that who :47 did it was it Leonardo da Vinci one of the one of the greats right he carved David out of the Rock and he said David was always there I just had to chip away :54 everything that was not him and and I think the process of evolution is almost that that it's not as if you :59 and I are blank slates right now and we go who do we want to be there's a level of freedom to that but it's almost who have we always been that we've :07 been ignoring this whole time the idea for me building my business around creation now dude I grew up :14 playing music all I wanted to do was play music as an adult that was the only thing I dreamed of doing was music drama :20 Then I then I spent almost a decade of my life where the main part of what I did was speaking and creating messages :26 yeah and then I started an ads agency and I was just an ad accounts all day and then I built a team and I was just :32 in meetings all day there was no point where I was this is the version of Dan that I feel I'm supposed to be I just lost sight of that and it's it's :40 so tough that it takes really low moments for us to get there but whatever :45 it takes for us to get there it's almost less about imagining and it's more about remembering :52 it's more about remembering the person we've always been and coming back to that the the interesting one story :58 I told recently was the pervasive childhood memory for me was Lego :03 so I would get Lego and I would assemble it and I'd immediately disassemble it and then make it into lots of different :10 things that were my own creations and it's interesting I'd done the same thing in business right I'd immediately :16 learned something and then disassemble it and make it slightly mine to get a result from it and I still do that to :22 this day that that innate okay there's a pattern here there's a system to follow :28 but in the process of building that system I think I've seen a better way to do it I'm going to do it on my own and :35 again I ignored that or so many times where I overplayed that as as a :41 one-trick pony of being I'm just going to be a derivative of that and it is largely remembering that find something :48 stand on the shoulders of giants but then in a from a creative sense down on the shoulder of :54 Giants and then choose choose

[ __ ] so why do we have a complicator why is it that people go :27 through all of the seasons of being someone they're not and all that stuff is it that we just don't know is :32 it that we feel we haven't given ourselves permission for it we don't have the skills because I feel I'm in the same season I only want to do :39 stuff I'm excited to do and it's super profitable super fun and I'm why :44 did I not do this not only that the crazy thing is people admire and respect :50 it much more than any other action because they're it is so obvious that someone is living their own lives :57 yeah and that is freedom yeah right so we talk about Freedom as the the highest pursuit of humans and these :03 things which I believe and when they see someone doing what they really genuinely :09 want and loving it people are I want to follow this model right :15 and you can be so uncompromising on that yeah I am so uncompromising now I :21 am so strong boundaries around things that I do yeah and but in the container :29 is coaching word in the container of what I make it's going to be the best thing it possibly is for what it you :35 know what it says on the turn and people people admire and respect that yeah because they're that's Freedom he's :40 doing what he wants yo I think Joseph Campbell says we're not so much searching for meaning in life as we are :46 for the experience of being Fully Alive and then people wonder why as a stressed :51 out coach they're struggling to get clients but it's if I'm signing up to a coach who looks they're :57 miserable and stressed and that they hate the business that they're in yeah in what world am I going to be feeling :04 more Fully Alive working with them than another coach who feels you're looking at their business and :10 you're going are they having this thing called fun that's crazy and that's been interesting for me as I've been creating :16 content more in this year as I've been burned everything to the ground simplified things people will say things :21 I really your videos don't really know why I feel such a connection with you I really your energy or :28 something to that effect and for me this marketing psychology and all sorts :33 of stuff and no doubt I have skills that are undergirding that I've built over the last few years the biggest thing is :39 I'm only creating videos I want to create yeah I refuse to create anything I'm not excited about so I we have done :47 no YouTube research when with launching the YouTube channel around best Trends I'm I want to talk :52 about things I want to talk about and I want to talk about them in a way that I'm excited to talk about them I don't want to just create content for the sake :58 of it I don't want to create a funnel for the sake of it I don't want to create anything for the sake of it but most people that's where they live from :04 they live from that energy of need and I have to rather than the energy of I get to yeah yeah and that's where I think :10 there's the big shift that that a lot of people could make I think it could and I think there's a whole industry that's going to prevent them right which is the :17 one we're in right because I think I think a huge amount of people buy coaching or what is cool coaching now in :23 terms of the group coaching environment because of trauma bonding right they're looking for an authority figure in their life because they were unfulfilled from :30 the authority figures that were presented to them in early life and you've alluded to this :35 and there's a huge fear of Annoying mummy or Daddy because you don't follow the system right and that

one we're in right because I think I think a huge amount of people buy coaching or what is cool coaching now in :23 terms of the group coaching environment because of trauma bonding right they're looking for an authority figure in their life because they were unfulfilled from :30 the authority figures that were presented to them in early life and you've alluded to this :35 and there's a huge fear of Annoying mummy or Daddy because you don't follow the system right and that :41 and that as then injected learned helplessness into the actions of people who are scared to :47 move on their own and scared to do what they really want in case there aren't casts from the group so we've got we've :53 got mummy and daddy issues trauma bonding and tribe Dynamics or convalescing :58 around keeping people stuck yeah but just enough people can mimic the business model of the person they're :04 learning from or the the skills or whatever it is to be successful for that to for the that scheme to continue yeah :12 but the the failure the failure rates of the promise result in this industry are :17 disgusting they're single-figure percentages because the promises got so big and so ridiculous and the guarantees :23 got so out of this world thanks Mr homozy the purple book over there yeah yeah or you don't :28 pay but it's acceptable to have single figure success things :34 yeah but the interesting thing about what both you and I have done is not measured success just on money right :40 we're we're talking to people and saying what lights you're out do you want a fun business do you want to do it with these :46 yeah because you can have profit as well yeah but it's a byproduct of these things and we talk about profit we talk :52 about money we talk about all these things because they're important to get freedom and they're Downstream from these things and they enable resources :57 enable us to do things but I think the interesting thing that the interesting Journey both you and I are on right now :04 is that we're not doing it when we're not making money that's compromising the fun and the ease and the values and :09 those things yeah and that's what people resonate with they're because money is :15 people hate that money is easy yeah right the other stuff is difficult oh yeah but if it it's got to be the :23 right money it's got to be the right school board and that's what people are looking for and that's that's the :28 healthy byproduct of a sophistication of a Marketplace as well because people someone said to me in a message this :35 morning I'm not looking for another Guru right now and I was tongue-in-cheek :40 back saying thank you for tangentially calling me a guru what are you and then just start asking questions :46 what do they want in those things yeah and and none of the questions how much money do you want to make yeah it's what are you doing right now :53 what are you enjoying what are you hating what do you want us to look yeah and what's meaningful to :58 you in terms of profitability and those things from where you are yeah in many cases the hard thing that people only go of is :05 that to change business models and change some of the things that they need to change because they're keeping them trapped yeah there is a period where you :11 go backwards before you go forwards I've had to go backwards before I went forwards and and recent :16 history yeah but I needed to do it for lots of reasons but I also had :22 accepted that that was going to be the case that I could I could take the L's for a few months to get back on :28 to to do and be inside something that I loved I think this :34 brings me to the word of the theme that I had for this year which is :39 this whole idea of

go forwards I've had to go backwards before I went forwards and and recent :16 history yeah but I needed to do it for lots of reasons but I also had :22 accepted that that was going to be the case that I could I could take the L's for a few months to get back on :28 to to do and be inside something that I loved I think this :34 brings me to the word of the theme that I had for this year which is :39 this whole idea of conscious yeah and I hate that in the way that it gets hijacked by the spiritual entrepreneurs :44 of we work with conscious coaches and I understand we're repurposing all these words :51 idea of I want to build a life based off intention I want to be awake at the wheel not :59 asleep at the wheel not on autopilot and I think my hope is for anyone :04 listen to this conversation that they realize that without knowing all the details it :11 starts with the decision am I going to try and I was listening to someone the other day that was saying the opposite of being :17 yourself is fitting in because fitting in requires you to be someone that you think the tribe needs :23 you to be to fit in well yeah it's taking the shape of something to to make it fit exactly :30 right and so most of us have spent our lives being professional fitting inner :37 is right we have we we've managed the perception of other people we want to go to the event we don't want to be the odd :43 one out we don't want to be at the the metaphorical lunch table by ourselves we :48 want to be in a tribe and what that often means is we have to sacrifice who :54 we are to be what we think the tribe needs us and wants us to be and for me I :59 know it sounds it's for you it comes down to this decision you make which is that Am I Living For others am I going to live for myself and it :06 doesn't mean am I living a life of selfishness or selflessness the most selfless thing you could do is live a :11 life that's fully expressing yourself yeah in service of others yeah but it's :16 not even good strategy because being a freaky weirdo gets you the most attention fitting fitting in is the :23 least profitable thing that anyone can do get everybody's doing it but because it's not for the reasons of strategies :28 for the reasons of self-worth it's for the reasons of self-esteem yeah so it doesn't even make any sense on the :35 in the game that people are trying to play yeah or fitting it because standing out :41 is the most profitable thing you can ever do in today's society and isn't it ironic it's in Pursuit that's :49 what I found with with the season I'm in is the less I focus on money and the more I focus on doing stuff I want to do the more money I make Yeah Yeah the more :56 fun I have the more it makes to the point where we talked about this yesterday I was it should feel it's cheating yeah yeah right if :02 success but it should feel it's cheating yeah and sometimes I look around and go this must be cheating yeah I've had a :09 couple of days this week whereas this has got to be cheating yeah I did that I did that much and I got :16 this much back yeah across multiple domains financial and meaning and all those things this :22 feels cheating well this this just comes back to this idea of self-awareness who am I what am I :28 passionate about what are my skill sets what Life do I want to lead and then what business will help me achieve :34 those things and I think if people ask those questions we have you come up with some really hard :40 answers sometimes which is yeah I'm making I have a business that is exists to pay the bills or fuel the ego

# New Transcripts James - Part 7

. So great to see you on this. Great to see you on this call., well, James, let's get into this kind of raw messy format that we, we've obviously perfected after one previous call, this, but, I think we'll be, We're gonna run a workshop on, on messy Catchups. Totally. This is, you guys have all been auto deducted another a hundred dollars. We've auto, we've auto deducted your credit cards. This is an informal workshop., no, I think we'll be a cool place to start is, I would love to hear from you what have been the themes of this year for you so far. We can then go back and forth and play pitch and catch and talk about, the lessons and what's working and what's not, and the pivots. But for you so far in 2025, what has been the vibe? What's been the theme? What's been coming up for you?, two, two big things., clear modalities, being clear about coaching, being clear about consulting, being clear about mentorship and leaning into those, the the distinctions between them, and consumption. And, that getting, getting people, creating an, creating opportunities for people to consume your stuff, whether it's free or paid leads to opportunities. And there are, there are, we can both, we can talk about the ways to do that, but if people consume your stuff, then they know, and trust you and they're likely to do something with you. Yep. And what's, what's been the under the hood feeling for you going into this year? Was it, was it about keep doing what you're doing? Was it about unscrewing yourself on certain decisions and things that? what's been the actual feeling that you've had in your business? There's, there's been quite a lot of tension with me because the, the, the biggest tension for me that has been separating what I need from what the people in my clients and my world need and, and make, trying to make clear distinctions between this is right for me, but I need to communicate clearly that it might not be right for you right now. Yeah. Because the things that I need and the things I want to do, are I'm coming from a different place with different resources and different goals, and I need to ensure that people are doing the right thing at the right stage and not just copying what I'm doing just because I'm doing it and understanding the context about why I'm doing it. So there's been a lot of tension about trying to communicate, this is right for me, but it might not be right for you and this is right for you, but it's it, I'm not doing it right. This is not right for me. Yeah, Totally. That's been, that's been really hard. That's been really difficult for me. Yeah. And what was the, was there any major problem that you were trying to solve from that you created for yourself or experienced in 2024 that you were coming in? obviously that speaks to the modalities and the way that you frame it from a business model perspective, coming into this year, what were the big themes that you were, I need to get away, I need to get back to this, or I need to shift something? I think, I think the biggest thing for me is, coming into, at the end of, at the end of last year, coming into this year, I've got the circle and then we've got the syndicate. And because of the levels of access that I've given people, the lines between those were really blurry and my energy wasn't fully with the cir the people in the circle around coaching and availability, because I was starting to spread it as the, as the syndicate grew

. And because of the levels of access that I've given people, the lines between those were really blurry and my energy wasn't fully with the cir the people in the circle around coaching and availability, because I was starting to spread it as the, as the syndicate grew. So for me, the distinction of saying the syndicate is a mentorship community, I'm gonna give you everything and look over my shoulder, we're gonna talk on the Zoom calls and, and, and I will coach on those calls, but it's, this is the boundary. And then that freed up a lot of energy for me with the guys in the circle who get WhatsApp access and those things. So I can, I can lean in more proactively. So having that distinction for me was being clear to me that these people get this level of access and these people get this level of access. And it also helped people decide that where the right place was and being really comfortable with people, choosing their own journey., a number of people came from the syndicate and just said, listen, I'm not making use of this and I just want the content and I just want to come to a workshop once in a while and I want access to the training and I'm gonna downgrade. And not seeing that as a downgrade and, and just seeing it as someone choosing the lane that they needed to be in. So that Yeah. Yeah. There was the being clear that I, I can allocate, I've only got so much energy to coach people because coaching is, I believe coaching you need to go layers deeper about not just what someone is not doing or what they're gonna do next, but why they won't do it. Why they won't consistently do it, what's really in the way of it. And that requires a relationship and energy and some depth and some time. Yeah. Sounds juicy. IIII think also the bastardization of the coaching word, by, by a whole industry has been super dangerous about people saying that they're a coach. And it, for so much, 90, 90% of what people have been selling for a decade is consulting. It's, do this, do This. Well, it's, it's an info Info, It's a glorified info with chat. GPT support Coaching's way deeper than that. Yeah. It's not the things you do, it's why you do them and why you don't do them. And the human behind the, the machine that's pushing the buttons. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I just leaning into those, those distinctions for me as being super valuable about how and where and who I put energy to and why to have those clear distinctions and, and then allow people to make their own choices. Yep. I love that. Well, I'll share a bit about my start to the year. And for anyone who's just jumping on or wasn't here for the last call, we did this at the end of last year, this as much as you might be tempted to believe is not, James and I just self indulging, having this patting each other on the back. It's really about, it's mostly, it's mostly that, but we, it's, it's, it's 99% there. Let's, to be honest, the, the key is we're gonna go through the things that have worked for us, are working for us, we've made massive mistakes on, and we are changing, rethinking about this year. Our goal is to have you find yourself in some of the things we're sharing. So to go, oh, that's for me, or Oh my goodness, goodness, I was gonna do that. I'm so glad I'm, I'm not, they said that it sucked for them

. Our goal is to have you find yourself in some of the things we're sharing. So to go, oh, that's for me, or Oh my goodness, goodness, I was gonna do that. I'm so glad I'm, I'm not, they said that it sucked for them. Right? So our goal in all of this is to really bring you into our thinking and both the pragmatic changes, the strategic changes, the tactical stuff we've tried, but more than more importantly to bring in, bring you into the how we're thinking. So if you guys have questions as we go through it, I highly recommend dropping them in the chat. And also treat this you're tweeting the Oscars, right? If something really resonates, let's, let's make this an active conversation so that we know that there might be certain threads we wanna pull on or certain direction we wanna go, want to go in, more. So the theme for me this year has been super deep in a work that has manifested in simplification of the model. So hands up for anyone on this call who struggles with a pattern of self abandonment or putting yourself last in a lot of your life. Cool. The delay made me feel I was definitely the only one that had my hand up, in which case that's fine., for me, this has been a huge pattern and there's, we can go so deep on it, but, but if we're just starting at the starting place of this year and what were the thoughts were coming into it, I've spent a lot of my life simply trying to figure out how to be useful to other people at the expense of my soul. And that that can a hundred percent still manifest today with clients where I'll be, well I'll give you an example. Last year I launched this community bond autonomy from which there are people on this community, on this call that are from that community. And there was nothing in me that wanted to launch it from a passion alignment. Something's missing, I wanna do this. It was purely the obligation of, I feel I have to do something for a, a portion of people, of my audience that aren't a fit for what I'm currently doing. And so when I think about business over the last 18 months, it's been this rollercoaster of simplicity to complexity and then back to simplicity. And so the end of 2023, business was so simple and so freaking dialed, man, one offer two tiers of access, 170,000 a month, USD recurring revenue, very simple delivery. And then what happened was at the start of last year, I launched this, this thing called modern autonomy. It added 44,000 a month of recurring in the first seven days. I was, oh my gosh, I'm a wizard. This is amazing. And then everything went down from downhill from there. 'cause it was a separate community, different to my main community. Then when I was sending an email, it's, oh, so which, which offer am I trying to, who, who's this for? Is this for the beginning market or the more advanced market delivery became complex? I went back to my bro scaling ways. We added, all the bells and whistles into this offer. And it took me a long time to realize, I just need to not sell people into that. And we still have 50 something people in there. We're still delivering, there's still calls and, and all of that stuff. But that was a huge lesson of, there was not anything in me that wanted to do that other than I felt obligated and I needed to do that. And that's been a pattern that I've been trying to unlearn

. And it took me a long time to realize, I just need to not sell people into that. And we still have 50 something people in there. We're still delivering, there's still calls and, and all of that stuff. But that was a huge lesson of, there was not anything in me that wanted to do that other than I felt obligated and I needed to do that. And that's been a pattern that I've been trying to unlearn. And so coming into this, this year, couple of key things and and some of you need to write this down and tattle it on your forehead, less but better, less but better. that. That was a huge theme where I was, there was a point where I had a content team and I was posting two times a day across a million platforms and it made me no more money. It just made me stress that I was putting up more s**t content everywhere., because the team just was going for volume and we need to get two reels a day, regardless of if they're any good. And so it's just been less about Bender, just come back to the foundations one, offer two tiers of access, focusing on on, on things YouTube and the mini video sales letter. But it's been much more philosophical than it has been pragmatic. It's been me questioning the way that I think about my business. This core belief. I know that you and I share James, is, your business is supposed to be built around your life, not the other way around. Not you are not here to serve your business. But I, I got caught up in that a little bit in the last year and I was just doing stuff 'cause I thought it was what I needed to do, showing up for clients in a way that I was, this is what clients need. The worst part was, is that I was recreating things or doing things or being a, a dancing monkey waving my hands on camera. Clients weren't asking for that. I just felt the sense of obligation of, oh, I have free time in my calendar. I must need to create something for clients right now. Letting go of that energy of obligation been huge. Can I ask a question just from, 'cause we've got the benefit of hindsight. Yeah. Looking back, what, what signals during that, that decision about modern autonomy and launching that, what signals do you look back on that you should have paid attention to? Oh, it was what come back. It was everything about should I launch this offer was blinking red lights on the dashboard, right? And so I think I straddle this really, really hard tension, which is sometimes you don't know how something's gonna feel until you do it, which is why we are all grand experimenters and scientists trying new things. However, some things are not worth testing. And so I think one of the best decision filters that I have come back to time and time again is by someone I know we both look up to a guy called Derek s Siver who says, if it's not a hell yes, it's a no. And dude, you, I I wasn't exactly running an ex an experiment by launching a community and having 150 people join in seven days. That's a commitment, right? And so I think right away, because I couldn't decide on whether or not to do it, that should have been my decision. 'cause it wasn't a, hell yes. It was this uncomfortable feeling in my body, feeling stressed, sitting in this room. This is an Airbnb, but I happened to be here when I launched Modern Autonomy last year. And I'd be sitting in this room stressing out about this idea of launching this thing

. That's a commitment, right? And so I think right away, because I couldn't decide on whether or not to do it, that should have been my decision. 'cause it wasn't a, hell yes. It was this uncomfortable feeling in my body, feeling stressed, sitting in this room. This is an Airbnb, but I happened to be here when I launched Modern Autonomy last year. And I'd be sitting in this room stressing out about this idea of launching this thing. But because I'd already posted about it and got feedback and built a wait list of 1400 people or something that, there was this obligation of, well, I guess I have to do it now. And I think getting more comfortable with just unapologetically setting standards, setting boundaries, saying This is what I want to do. I don't have to explain this to anyone. I don't have to justify this to anyone. I'm doing this 'cause I want to do it, or I'm not doing this 'cause I don't wanna do it. That I think was the big thing that I was ignoring last year. There was still a very strong, but people need help, man. I, I can be Dan Bolton, I can be people's savior. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go out here. I'm just gonna save the world from bad coaches and bad content and, and poverty. And I'm just telling you right now, the freedom that I've felt this year of just letting go of the idea that I cannot help everyone, nor am I, nor am I meant to try and help everyone or, I'm not even capable of helping Everyone has been very freeing of going, there is a pocket of people somewhere around the world. Those are my people. My job is to sh to put the bat signal up as much as I can through my content. So those people know where to find me. And I think that's been really liberating and also heartbreaking. 'cause you're, man, I just can't help all the people and I can't, I can't be everything to everyone, which I think is a deep temptation than many of us. So that's been a big thing for me this year. Less but better simplification, going back to how decisions feel in my body, all that kinda stuff. Does that change the way you've made decisions or the speed that you make them? Yeah, speed question's. Interesting. Definitely how I make decisions. right now, The, the Dan Bolton that that, that, that I know tells me about one thing in the morning and then he is done it by the afternoon. Yeah, dude, it's interesting. There's certain things I think I've just, I've, I start to weigh the scope of what I'm testing and trying. For example, you have an idea about a certain type of YouTube video. The the risk is so low, you put it out and it sucks. I put out A-V-S-L-A few months ago and it was 42 minutes and it was, s**t, the moment I created it and I uploaded it and it was s**t in results. So, but that's not a irreversible decision. And so I think, I'll give you a really pragmatic example. We are gonna escape New Zealand summer right now. It's stunning., in about a month it'll be less stunning. And so we're trying to weigh up where we're gonna go for a few months as a family and we can't decide, but we are gonna leave some, we are gonna leave to somewhere in four weeks and we have nothing booked. Hmm

. So, but that's not a irreversible decision. And so I think, I'll give you a really pragmatic example. We are gonna escape New Zealand summer right now. It's stunning., in about a month it'll be less stunning. And so we're trying to weigh up where we're gonna go for a few months as a family and we can't decide, but we are gonna leave some, we are gonna leave to somewhere in four weeks and we have nothing booked. Hmm. But I'm allowing myself to feel okay in that feeling of not knowing, because if I go down the rabbit hole of trying to, research every island in Hawaii, or ask chat GBT the best places for our family in Europe, it's really demonstrating. I'm not saying I haven't not done that. I'm just saying I'm not going to make that My only thing, I I'm relaxing in the not knowing of allowing myself to, when I know to move fast, to move fast, and when I don't know what to do, I can sit with it. And allowing myself the familiarity with feeling uncomfortable is a very powerful frame. this, this is worth writing down for some of you who really struggle with specific vices or maybe struggle with creating, chaos in complex in your business. One of the top life coaches in the world, Brooke Castillo, she said something so profound when she was talking about how she overcame drinking. She said, I realized I didn't have an over drinking problem. I had an under feeling problem. And I think many of us are moving lives not towards something, but away from something. We're trying to desperately not feel the thing. And there's a superpower in just being able to feel it and not have to solve it and not have to do something with it. Right? It's today you realize that you're on this call and you realize your business sucks and your clients aren't great. And, but you don't have to burn it to the ground and change everything overnight. You can just allow yourself to feel it. And I think that's been a huge theme for me is allowing myself to feel the discomfort. Because oftentimes I will try and act myself out of discomfort and that will create a misalignment. That's the, that's the the paradox of being someone who takes action, right? Is that you know how to get out of stress, but it's just what stress are you trying to get out of? Because Well also, is the stress possible to get out of right now, You can get the stress of, well, if I just make more money, it'll be fine. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And more and, and more money can compound onto, more obligation. Yeah. And then especially in the, in the, in the gig that we run. Yeah. So let's, let's go back and forth on some of this stuff around we, I don't think there's a a, I don't think there's a list of, let's go through what works and what doesn't and what we're trying, just let's talk about some really key things and narrow in on some stuff that we've observed or that's worked for us really thinking about this first quarter. Does that sound good? Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Cool. Do you wanna start? I've got a list here. Yeah. I think we, we have, we have slightly different philosophies in terms of maybe front end products and those strategic moves, right? And it's interesting to me of a hundred percent of the people who have joined me in, in in Q1, consume something. Yep. 90% consume something through the, through buying something and making the commitment an investment, whether it's $9 or a hundred dollars or $999, it didn't really matter

# New Transcripts James - Part 5

. James Kemp: Every time something happens they're just on this James Kemp: fucking emotional our client left. Oh, my God, I'm useless. James Kemp: What my mom said when I was 5 was right. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Oh, my God! And then, Shut down for 2 days James Kemp: there is. James Kemp: We are not our office, we are not, we are not James Kemp: yesterday's results. We are not our revenue. We are not our money in the bank, skills James Kemp: skills do do not have the decay that many short-term things in society have skills. James Kemp: Skills are the most durable thing that humans have. James Kemp: and I'm talking to. I'm coaching a few people now who are. James Kemp:, reach the heights of James Kemp: multiple $100,000 month, etc. James Kemp: And aren't there at the moment. But they've still got the social persona, and they're still posting on Facebook this. And those things. And they feel horrendous imposters in it. James Kemp: right? James Kemp: And so that's a challenge, because I'm taking them back to put to tell them that the skills are durable. James Kemp: I played paddle on the weekend for the 1st time. Everyone plays paddle here. There's fucking courts everywhere, right? I played tennis to a rep level up to about 17, James Kemp: and so I was good, and I haven't picked up a racket that James Kemp: resemble the tennis racket in 20 years. James Kemp: and I picked it up, and 5 min later I was smashing all over the place. It hadn't gone away. James Kemp: Skills are extremely durable. James Kemp: But James Kemp: we get very, very caught up in the short term results, or the perceived social impact of those things. James Kemp: but and that the counterintuitive pieces to to lean into those and make offers that that most people will run away from Lana North: Awesome. Lana North: Thank you very much. James Kemp: Thank you. James Kemp: Hey, Jonathan Jonathan Ells: Hey, man? Awesome. I have. So with the question with the install offer, does this work for Jonathan Ells: a 1 on one private coaching offer, or does this have to be because you were referencing? You want to front, load all your one on one work James Kemp: Present. Yeah, if it's Jonathan Ells: So so, okay, so if if I'm if I'm using, can, is it possible for me to use the install offer for my new group offer, and for my private one on one offer. Jonathan Ells: but not obviously not at the same time. But, this week, I I make a bunch of offers for my group, using the install offer and then use a similar install offer 2 weeks later for the one on one private? Or does that ? Zap? Your audience really quickly. James Kemp: if they've got distinctly different levels of access Jonathan Ells: And James Kemp: Yeah, you can have multiple install offers. James Kemp: I'm rolling out a a different one in 2 weeks. Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: Distinct front. Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: Think short term front end offer, and that one will have 2 access levels, right? And we'll have a James Kemp: a membership access level and a syndicate access level. James Kemp: And I'm considering putting a 3rd one in there as well. So selling across the spectrum. James Kemp: So yeah, you can have

. Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: Distinct front. Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: Think short term front end offer, and that one will have 2 access levels, right? And we'll have a James Kemp: a membership access level and a syndicate access level. James Kemp: And I'm considering putting a 3rd one in there as well. So selling across the spectrum. James Kemp: So yeah, you can have. James Kemp:, the the central component is that something gets done over a time period, right? James Kemp: And that's very relative to how much effort Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: You will take, and how much effort they will take, because you could have James Kemp: For example, with your clients. James Kemp: You could have a training install offer, because people are my diet's good, but my training sucks. James Kemp: But you could also have a nutrition install offer, which is James Kemp: my my training's fine. But my diet sucks right? James Kemp: Because remember, we're talking to solution awareness in the marketplace. James Kemp: And that's why we have to go into the market James Kemp: to offer what they already want, and they believe the solution is applied to. James Kemp: It is not about what we have. It is about what they want Jonathan Ells: Got you, would that? Okay? Okay. Jonathan Ells: so and and and that doesn't . Jonathan Ells: let's say, I make a nutrition install offer this week. And then next week I do, and I do an install offer for my one on one private, because that's where I want to get some more people in right now. Will that Jonathan Ells: cause fatigue on my audience, cause that's that something's happened that I'm not getting responses anymore. I think maybe I'm I've drifted too far with my messaging. But Jonathan Ells: maybe I'm starting to talk to what I think people should should want, instead of what they want, or something that that I just have not been cognizant of. But is there such thing as an audience? Fatigue ? Because I feel the more I offer, the less I the fewer responses I get James Kemp: Yeah, if the if the offers are all over the map and nonspecific, then they're easy to ignore, and they're easy to anticipate. James Kemp: Right Jonathan Ells: Hmm. James Kemp: There's a there's Jonathan Ells: So I got to be James Kemp: Component to keeping audiences off balance James Kemp: because it keeps it interesting, keeps it novel. James Kemp: and attention is a attention is a product of novelty. James Kemp: So James Kemp: over the short time period, can you just turn around an audience and get them to respond to things immediately on mass? James Kemp: Very rarely can you condition them to relatively quickly, to receive offers very frequently. Yeah, you can James Kemp:, I said. I'm making multiple offers concurrently James Kemp: in some cases multiple times a day. James Kemp: and I get response and feedback to varying degrees across the board right? But there's also a James Kemp: a novelty factor that that induces, because people don't know what I'm going to do next. James Kemp: And when people say say to me, When is this open again? James Kemp: I always say I don't know. James Kemp: I'll open this again in the future, because they genuinely don't. James Kemp: But I also genuinely don't want them to know that even if I did Jonathan Ells: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jonathan Ells: So, okay, so right now, with this install offer, I know this is super easy for me to send to my email list really easy to send my email list

. James Kemp: I'll open this again in the future, because they genuinely don't. James Kemp: But I also genuinely don't want them to know that even if I did Jonathan Ells: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jonathan Ells: So, okay, so right now, with this install offer, I know this is super easy for me to send to my email list really easy to send my email list. But for my Instagram account and my Facebook group, how do I apply the install install offer to those things, what do I do in those case to get James Kemp: What Mikel did in the syndicate. He's in Bali. So he I think he was on the call on Tuesday. James Kemp: He did a poll on Instagram, and I can't remember James Kemp: which the 2 options one was. James Kemp: he works with coaches right? One was James Kemp: what do you want? My, what do you want my next workshop to be? James Kemp: Do you want me to cover the Instagram DM strategy, or do you want me to cover? James Kemp: I think it was his offer. Creation, strategy right? And he and he ran a poll. James Kemp: And then with polls on Instagram, you can see who the respondents are right. James Kemp: And then he just got the aggregate data, but he also had hand raisers for what people wanted. James Kemp: And so then he could go to those people. You could say. James Kemp: you can have a poll and say. James Kemp: if you could make wave a magic wand in 30 days. James Kemp: . What if? What have you done in the last 30 days. You've had a consistent training program or had a consistent nutrition. James Kemp: And, diet or something that. James Kemp: So have those it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how you phrase it. But, just have those 2 distinctions. James Kemp: because then you're going to have people who are engaging around a small idea. James Kemp: and then you could ask them. James Kemp: Hey, were you looking to install a new diet plan James Kemp: to lose weight in the next 30 days. James Kemp: Yes, I am. James Kemp: I've got something that you might want to look at. Jonathan Ells: Hey? So you gotta you gotta get them to raise their hand James Kemp: You've both Jonathan Ells: Okay, I gotta get better weight James Kemp: You've got to find the people who believe they know the solution. James Kemp: Do you understand the distinction Jonathan Ells: Huh! Jonathan Ells: No, no! Do you find the people that believe they know the solution James Kemp: Yes, because they. James Kemp: There's people who believe right now the reason they're fat. James Kemp: It's because of their training program. James Kemp: There's people that believe right now, the reason they're fat is because of their diet. James Kemp: Right? I'm just oversimplifying everything just for for an example. James Kemp: They already have the solution in their mind, but they don't know James Kemp: how to approach it. What to do. Which version of the which diet do I follow? James Kemp: They are looking for the the the narrowing of their focus around the solution. It's my diet Jonathan Ells: Okay, Jonathan Ells: I don't know how I apply that because my program does 4 thing. It's it's 4 areas at once. Nutrition, mindset training and health habits. James Kemp: We're solving for Jonathan Ells: Yes. James Kemp: Do they do? They do? They need different components of everything. Of course they do. James Kemp: Do

. It's my diet Jonathan Ells: Okay, Jonathan Ells: I don't know how I apply that because my program does 4 thing. It's it's 4 areas at once. Nutrition, mindset training and health habits. James Kemp: We're solving for Jonathan Ells: Yes. James Kemp: Do they do? They do? They need different components of everything. Of course they do. James Kemp: Do. They believe that it's 1 thing, or they want to believe. It's 1 thing, because we tend to oversimplify James Kemp: most everything, to just to to cope with the world. James Kemp: It's my dog Jonathan Ells: So you just you have to get. So my, my issue over the last little while, man, it's been driving me absolutely nuts is I can't even get people to raise their hand the 1st time. So I want to start conversations with people James Kemp: You're cooking. Jonathan Ells: And I want to start James Kemp: People are, okay, well, yeah, of course, I want to lose weight. But that means this. James Kemp: That means I have to go on a diet. That means I have to go join a gym. That means I have to be seen in public in tight clothes. That means I have to change my whole life. James Kemp: I don't want to do any of that right. Only highly highly motivated people. James Kemp: We'll sign up to general fitness and James Kemp: fitness programs that have all components of everything James Kemp: they've been told by their doctor. They need to, or they're absolutely sick to death of it, right? James Kemp: Most everyone else has an incentive on some dimension. James Kemp: Remember, we talked about the the incentive of James Kemp: someone who's reluctant to take their clothes off in front of their partner James Kemp: And then maybe the little comments are coming up, the the the loss of weight. James Kemp: It's not a representation of how good they look in the mirror. James Kemp: It's a representation of the respect they receive in their relationship, and the relationship is probably James Kemp: in some cases more important to them than their own self-esteem. James Kemp: And there are failings. James Kemp: So when we understand incentives behind James Kemp: solutions and desires of people, we can talk to those, to those incentives Jonathan Ells: So instead of so you're saying, instead of talking to losing weight, which, every person that follows me wants to lose weight. But you talk to the reason why they want to lose the weight. Jonathan Ells: So instead of saying, Hey, so you can lose 15 to 20 pounds. It's so you can feel confident. Jonathan Ells: So you can. So you can feel confident, naked with your partner again. Jonathan Ells: And but the thing is okay, that's great. But James Kemp: The reason. The reason that that most everyone wants to make money James Kemp: is because they want to feel safe. James Kemp: So the reason that most everyone wants to make money is that they want the most James Kemp: core human need, which is safety. James Kemp: because safety is proximal to survival right. James Kemp: So the reason that make money is such a big category of, selling help. And those things is because everyone wants to be safe. James Kemp: the reason that that weight, loss, and fitness are James Kemp: such big categories as both volume, because the world's fat James Kemp: and secondly, because of the the innate social James Kemp: desires that sit underneath it, but with feelings. Now, matter, vanity is now a thing James Kemp: generationally it didn't used to matter what males look

. And those things is because everyone wants to be safe. James Kemp: the reason that that weight, loss, and fitness are James Kemp: such big categories as both volume, because the world's fat James Kemp: and secondly, because of the the innate social James Kemp: desires that sit underneath it, but with feelings. Now, matter, vanity is now a thing James Kemp: generationally it didn't used to matter what males look . And now males are more vain than females. James Kemp: There's this whole category of people who are, I want to be beautiful, and I'm a man. James Kemp: So it opened up this whole marketplace because the because of the the social marketplace shifted James Kemp: so that the incentives have just changed. James Kemp: But they've got bigger. James Kemp: But the incentives underlying it are always people want to lose weight or get jacked, or whatever. James Kemp: for an underlying reason Jonathan Ells: Hmm. Jonathan Ells: okay. So I gotta do that through somehow. That's that's the hardest part, right? There is. How do I? How do I Jonathan Ells: create stories and content James Kemp: That there's a gigantic universe of reasons why people want to look good naked, and you pick one Jonathan Ells: Yeah, and you have to test it. It's just, I'm gonna do this piece of content today on this thing that I think that people want because they want to go. Look this reason that I think James Kemp: We don't need to think, though, we observe James Kemp: out in the marketplace, we observe from the data, the data is, someone else is selling it James Kemp: you? It is a transformation that you've initiated before. James Kemp: Right. All of those things are real or measurable. Jonathan Ells: Hmm. James Kemp: And then we Jonathan Ells: It's true, too. James Kemp: One dimension, different Jonathan Ells: Okay, I still fit. Okay. James Kemp: The challenge is not that there's a lack of reasons why people want to James Kemp: lose weight, as there's an above Jonathan Ells: No, I know that's what I'm saying. So James Kemp: Isolate around a singular one. Jonathan Ells: Got you. Jonathan Ells: Yeah. And only the problem is, now this is opens up more questions and more things to answer instead of finding. So I still don't know what I'm gonna post tomorrow. James Kemp: It. It does if it does. If you sit in the in the world of James Kemp: of thinking and and and believe that that's a path to progress. James Kemp: The world of action is testing and failing in the marketplace of going. No one responded to that Jonathan Ells: That's all I've done for a year and a half is test and fail James Kemp: But the paradox for most people is that we are. We are in problems of abundance. James Kemp: not problems of scarcity. James Kemp: And then we leverage. James Kemp: We are in an abundant world where we can communicate with damn near anyone on any James Kemp: particular issue and dimension. James Kemp: And then we. And then so we expand the number of things that we say to the number of people that we say. James Kemp: But when we come back to the Central, the central idea of the clients aren't scarce, but we are. James Kemp: Then there's a central idea there, that is the one that we give a shit about. James Kemp: or the one that we feel most qualified to to do, or the one that we feel most excited about. James Kemp: I I don't care about making money

. James Kemp: But when we come back to the Central, the central idea of the clients aren't scarce, but we are. James Kemp: Then there's a central idea there, that is the one that we give a shit about. James Kemp: or the one that we feel most qualified to to do, or the one that we feel most excited about. James Kemp: I I don't care about making money. James Kemp: I care about making money, and then what life it gives me James Kemp: for me and my family, right? So it's a route through. James Kemp: and I care about that a lot, and I and I care a lot about helping other people who James Kemp: who match some of those characteristics to achieve that which they call freedom. James Kemp: Right? So it's really easy for me to do what I do, and and show up to do it. James Kemp: because I just see myself as a dealer of freedom, because I have immense amounts of freedom James Kemp: on lots of different dimensions, and the beauty in that. James Kemp: and the beauty of me loving it is that I can then have a abundant mindset of I can help James Kemp: everybody be free. James Kemp: But there's only one of me. James Kemp: so I have scarcity of things I give a shit about. James Kemp: and that allows me to be abundant, whereas most people who aren't James Kemp: have a scarce idea of money. James Kemp: but they're abundant in the ways that they try and get it, and that causes scattered James Kemp: lack of focus, trying to be everything for everybody. James Kemp: and and a desire to please people rather than a desire to to help one person James Kemp: and the central, the central currency that we deal with isn't is a people. James Kemp: and all my best offers James Kemp: were a byproduct of me wanting to help one person, and the the catalyst was that. James Kemp: And it just happened that James Kemp: 10 or a hundred, or in some cases a thousand people wanted that same thing. James Kemp: And so it scaled James Kemp: because I gave a shit about the the core. The core thing that I help. People do James Kemp: hope all of that was useful. James Kemp: Pick one. Thank you. James Kemp: Pick one thing and ask them. James Kemp: Steve. James Kemp: I gotta go on a seat. James Kemp: Where'd you go? James Kemp: You're still muted Steve Roberts: You there, mate? James Kemp: Yeah. Steve Roberts: I'll get my cigarette lighter off. Now, that was a bit when I had a concept, just James Kemp: Always go there, every Steve Roberts: Really not. Steve Roberts: That was great. Jimmy James Kemp: Reaching from the mountain Steve Roberts: I just wanted to add, on top of what you were saying. I just had a meeting with the client this morning Steve Roberts: who's already lost 15 kgs. Steve Roberts: but he still has an underlying fear of taking his shirt off at the beach James Kemp: So. Steve Roberts: He's not quite there yet, but yet he's still with me. So Steve Roberts: when you said you're helping them find the route to their freedom, I think that was really Steve Roberts: quite well, well, put as far as my experience working with that particular client is, it's Steve Roberts: peeling back the layers Shrek. keep it James Kemp: Yeah

# New Transcripts James - Part 9

. I do. I just form a, an idea of a future that someone that I wanna live and, and, and, and trust that other people are gonna wanna live that too. Yeah. And then, and then, what, what, what financial needs do I have that I need to meet in terms of obligations and rationally take actions that meet those. you say, if you've gotta pay rent, go and get some f*****g money to pay the rent. Yeah, totally. But that's a, that's a practical, that's a practical, action after you've done the other two. Yeah. Because you've, you've, you're understanding that you're taking that action not out of, being upset that your mommy doesn't love you. It's that you are, that you're gonna make money that, that to pay the rent or whatever you need because you have financial needs. Those, those, but those things are, those things can be separated. Yep. Your need for money is not feeding the need you think it is. So go and find the need that you have that to be fed and go and make money A need underneath it. Yeah. Yeah. I'll, I'll quickly share my 2 cents on this and then I want to talk about some tactical funnel stuff. I think everyone will find really valuable., I think about it this, everyone has two categories of things that they don't want to do in their business. One of them would fall under conveniences. So for me, I'll, I'll just be so clear, right? No sales calls is a convenience., I hate sales Calls. Can I, can I just, can I just say, do you, can you imagine how much money would make if we added a sales team to our businesses? It would be absurd. Dude. Can you imagine how many kgs I would gain if I added a sales team? You imagine, How do you imagine how much I would end up going back to drinking IPAs every day if that Happened? Oh dude, man, the life we could be living right now, it sounds so God amazing, God rich and miserable. Sign me up, lamb, Rambos and jet. Sorry. Alright, so let's get practical. Okay, so, so in in people's, I don't want to do this list. There are conveniences and convictions. Sales calls for me are a convenience, dude, if it's between me and my family, paying rent next week, bro, I'm gonna book out my calendar now. I'm gonna try and do it in my way. I'm gonna go take the calls on a walk, we'll do no video, but I'll be happy to talk to you all day if that's what it comes down to. But then there are convictions. And so if we're talking about what feels light and what feels heavy, there is, and I wanna be so emphatically clear because I believe in a very abundant universe, there is no situation you will ever face where there is not an aligned path for you to walk forward. I don't believe there is ever a time where the only path forward is when, where you have to compromise your convictions. Now I'm telling you right now, if you believe that you're gonna have to compromise your convictions, sometimes you will always find the path to compromise the convictions. But I do not believe any of us have to betray our values, betray our convictions to make money. I don't care how scarce it is, how, how badly you need to pay rent. And if you don't believe me, why don't you take it all the way to the nth degree? Do you ever believe that you're gonna have to pay that, that to pay rent, you would have to sell your body or kill someone. Now those are extreme examples

. But I do not believe any of us have to betray our values, betray our convictions to make money. I don't care how scarce it is, how, how badly you need to pay rent. And if you don't believe me, why don't you take it all the way to the nth degree? Do you ever believe that you're gonna have to pay that, that to pay rent, you would have to sell your body or kill someone. Now those are extreme examples. So then why would we take that in the lighter ways and go, oh yeah, it's not quite that bad. But also I don't wanna do it., I'll be really clear and pragmatic on this. There is never a situation where you should take money from someone you do not wanna work with. Now if you do not have an abundant mindset and you are scared, you are gonna take that money and you're gonna find a way to make it work. And I promise you, you're gonna regret it. So my belief is that yes, there are seasons where money, challenges us and stretches us to let go of conveniences, but I do not believe we ever find ourself in this situation so bad that we have to compromise on the convictions of who we are. I believe in an abundant universe, I believe everything is always working out for us. I believe all of creation is unconditionally supporting us. And you may not share that belief, but I promise that however you believe the universe will show up or will not show up for you is exactly what you'll receive. If you are constantly stuck in the feast and famine cycle of survival, you will never leave that unless you believe that there is another path always available to you. One that's aligned, one that allows you to do stuff you want to do with people you want to do it with. I think the world is just such an abundant place. I met a lady at the farmer's market the other day who was one of the best in the world at hu at Honey. So she's been making honey for the last 20 years, has been taking it to the world and has I tried the third best honey in the world? Dude, it was amazing. And so we're in this society, in this amazing time in humanity where you can make a unbelievable living knitting. I I met this guy who makes a full-time living, making pens at the farmer's market, right? Custom pens that look bullets. They're amazing. I believe for us as coaches and as value creators and as consultants, there is always an aligned path available to us. We just have to look for it and expect it., and That, that is, that is is wealth as well. Yes. Yes. But you will never see it if you don't believe it's there. You will always find what you're looking for. All right. Funnels less, less esoteric chat for a moment. That was a f*****g hand break by the way, and a left turn. The reason I wanna bring this up is because, I think you and tariffs, I can get so deep, let's talk about tar. So, alright, Elon Musk, doge, let's talk about it., no, no go. I wanna talk about funnels because I think, I think this is a, a really connected idea. So I think my core conviction is that we often don't make as much money as we should be making because we are not making it easy for people to give us money. I want everyone to do a self audit right now. How easy do you think you are making it for people to give you money? And the big lesson for me this year has just been the simplicity of having huge neon signs in my world to the next step through the funnel

. So I think my core conviction is that we often don't make as much money as we should be making because we are not making it easy for people to give us money. I want everyone to do a self audit right now. How easy do you think you are making it for people to give you money? And the big lesson for me this year has just been the simplicity of having huge neon signs in my world to the next step through the funnel. And so if I was to create a starter pack for, I'm a broke coach, and I don't know why number one would be, I never talk about my offer, right?, there are people who never talk about their offer and then they wonder why no one's buying. And I'm, you have to be talking about what you do. The second thing is, for the broke coach starter pack, and I dunno why is I'm not talking about my offer in a way that sounds appealing to the people I'm trying to appeal to. So you simply cannot say, if you want to work with me, unless you have a big audience of people filled with people who want to work with you, you have to be crystal clear in your messaging. You have to focus on them, not you. You have to articulate what's in it for them, not you. You have to be really clear. The third thing is you have to create a journey of easy yeses from stranger to paying customer to high paying client. And so whether you have the, the customer piece, let's just take this for example. Most of us have short freebie content and then we have big expensive thing. And so a prime example is people who only post short form style content and then they go, if you wanna work with me, book a call here. And the the leap from, from where they are to this one huge yes is monumental, which is why people have no shows and have three follow up calls. And, that's why people, you can have a hundred thousand Twitter followers and make no money because that audience is built off short content and is not a journey of easy yeses. So pragmatically for me, having a central focal point of a VA video sales letter, just continue to proves to be the most profitable thing that I could have and the most important thing that I could ever point people towards. So whenever I make that the focal point, that the next step in the journey, I make more money whenever I go, weeks and lead flow feels drier, I can always point to the fact that either I need to create a new VSL, which doesn't happen all that often, or I'm just simply not talking about it. So when I post on my stories multiple times a week, I have a VSL, you should check it out. I get more leads and make more money when I put it as the PS of my emails. It's, it, it, it works clockwork. And so for me, this big lesson of number one, making it easier for people to give you money, don't put the hard work and burden on their shoulders for them to figure out who, who your work is for how they work with you. And then number two, don't just make it easier for them to make, give you money through a sales conversation. Create a journey of easy yeses, move them to your longer form content, move them to your products, move them to your video sales letter. Allow them to go through that journey of more consumption before they get to the sales conversation

. And then number two, don't just make it easier for them to make, give you money through a sales conversation. Create a journey of easy yeses, move them to your longer form content, move them to your products, move them to your video sales letter. Allow them to go through that journey of more consumption before they get to the sales conversation. So any, any notes on that or anything that you've, I know you don't have a VSL so to speak, but anything that you've learned or been reminded of this year around this topic? Yeah, I, I, it's interesting the concept of VSL, because, a video sales letter, I would, I would argue that every time you go on video, you're making a video sales letter for an idea. Correct. And so the, the, the easy, the easy yes. After you create content is that what is the natural thing to point someone towards, to take the next step. Mm-hmm. And so I think if you're thinking about content, if you're thinking about ads, if you're thinking about anything is what is the na If you're selling someone an I on an idea, what is the natural next step for that person to take? Right. And natural, which is, I feel good about saying, I've just talked about this, I've just talked about this result a client's got or, or whatever, Hey, you can buy this thing for nine bucks, or you can come to this workshop, next week for, for free, or whatever it may be. But it's just, it's, it's the, it's empathy. It's the height of, if I was in someone's shoes and I stimulated and I stimulated some level of interest in this idea, what's the natural thing for them to do next? Because I think a lot of people to stop and a lot of people to stop and they don't make the offer because they've made the content for themselves, which is very common., because they wanted to get something off their chest that they're frustrated with, or, or an idea. And they also just don't think about what is the natural next step, because I think everything's a sales letter., because we are in the market of selling ideas, and some of those ideas need to be consumed in, in, in environments where people get the adequate support to, to fulfill on that idea, which is a paid product or a mm-hmm. Or a client experience, whatever it is. So yeah, I think it's just that the natural piece of, if you're making content, then put a put the natural next step. And we call that strategically a call to action. Mm-hmm. But what is the natural next step?, I'm running, it's close to a thousand dollars a day in ads at the moment, and it's, oh damn, dude. It's what's the natural next step? Right? Yeah. Well, I'm, they're four line ads Yeah. Saying, I've got this, it's good. Buy it. Yeah. Oh, by the way, when you buy this thing, this can, this cash campaign, this 11 email sequence, it goes really well with that. So maybe you should buy that by the, that's all makes sense. I've got a, I've got a, I've got a place where I've got 40 more of these things. Yeah. Do you wanna come in and try it for nine bucks? Yep., it's just, I, there is also something in back to vibes. Yep. If you don't feel good about your offer and you don't feel good about what it does and who it's for and, and, and how it's done, you won't want to promote it

. Yeah. Do you wanna come in and try it for nine bucks? Yep., it's just, I, there is also something in back to vibes. Yep. If you don't feel good about your offer and you don't feel good about what it does and who it's for and, and, and how it's done, you won't want to promote it. You don't feel good about the communication, you won't make it. Mm-hmm. You won't talk to it. You won't put it out there. And so everything we are saying isn't natural. So if you don't feel good about your offer on all dimensions, the price, the promise, who it's for, what they get, then you're not gonna make it. So you have to have con you put, put conditions up where I to think that people are stealing from me. I'm, this is absurd that I'm giving this much for $9 or $50 a week, or $250 a week, or whatever it might be. Yeah. I feel good when that happens. So therefore I do it a lot. A hundred percent. There's so many directions I want to go in., I would love to know just in the chat, what's coming up for you guys? What are some takeaways so far?, because the, I have a number of things listed out. I know, I know James has, but I'd love to know, what's coming up for you as an aha moment?, I, dude, my phone is overheating and I can't really, it's just getting dimmer and dimmer by the second, but I'm just rolling with it. And for whatever reason, my computer is internet list or some, or something., but, what, what, what's coming up for people? James, black t-shirts or, in Bali tank tops. Yeah. That's the uniform. Elizabeth, I didn't know you went by Elizabeth these days. I thought it was, I only, I I, I call her that. Every, every now and then, mache are talking to, well, let's young lady, let's talk about this for a second., there's this whole idea of authenticity and content, right? And the basics are, the basics are share about your life, share about yourself, right? Don't just, don't just teach what, bring people into your world. But I feel it's so much deeper than that. And it's almost a skill. what have you been learning in the last, the last three to six months around that element of ethos, personal brand, people buying into you, not just ideas, because obviously this connects to this idea of mentorship. How, how do you think about it these days? So when I, when I think about building a brand, there's, there's three components, right? There's, the identity that we help people manifest. There's the mechanisms that we use, marketing 1 0 1. This is my unique mechanism, but then there's this overarching piece of the world, ? And, and in my community I'll talk about, what world are you building? Who are the characters in it? And those pieces. What I think this has been happening for a long time, but what I have noticed is that we are shifting the, the what has been so commoditized, funnels, webinars, ads, low ticket, high ticket closing, and those things, they're so easy to replicate, right? And before you'd slap a f*****g unique mechanism and a little TM on the side and everyone would go, this is new. Oh my God, it's so amazing. And, I still give that advice 'cause it's still kinda work, right? Yeah

. Oh my God, it's so amazing. And, I still give that advice 'cause it's still kinda work, right? Yeah. We learned that from t in there and, call it something new even though it's not that new, right? And, and that, that was enough to, to get some traction and solve a problem. The, as the trust has declined in the media that we see across the whole, across everywhere from mainstream media all the way to social media, as trust has declined, people are looking through the surface stuff, the strategies, the mechanisms, even the identity and going, who is this person and what are they really doing behind this stuff? Right? So it's been harder for the fakers to fake the things because the, the fake things, you can't be consistent when you're lying. Right? So that eventually you get found out. Yeah. And so the world component of the brand is that people are looking through the surface stuff, the mechanisms, the products and those pieces and saying they're commodities. But who is this person? Where are they going? Who is going with them? What is ha They're looking through into the world, the physical world that people have in terms of their life, but also the, the, the virtual world that people have built in terms of their client, the community, and who's in it and, and, and where it is because people are looking for truth. Right? And that, so before you could slap a TM on something, say it was a unique mechanism and make a million dollars., it's kind of still available in a way if you, if you're good at it. Yeah. Yeah. But people are buying a lot more who than they ever have. Yeah. What are you doing, et cetera. And that is values and character based and truth based. So doing things that people can't replicate 'cause they're real is, is the best marketing that anyone can produce, right? It's the, it's, it's not marketing. It's showing in demonstration. And increasingly in a, in a world where people don't trust stuff, they want to, they want to see it, feel and touch it before they buy it. And so, making thing, making yourself someone who is easy to buy from is a product of letting people see who you are and who you really are. And also highlight bits that you want to clean up because you might not wanna show other people. And so the, so marketing is dying because marketing at a base level is manipulation because it manipulates someone into having a belief that they may not possess. Yeah. And, and it to, to get a short term transaction and demonstration and showing is, is, is growing. So that's why people are watching more long form content. That's why people are watching three hour podcasts with, politicians and those things, which sounds hell to most people, but they're looking for the, they're looking through something to, to the truth be, well, you can't, you can b******t me over 30 seconds, but you can't b******t me over three hours. Right? Right. And so the depth that we, that we need to come from in terms of what we're showing people, I think is, is just gonna be significantly, significantly deeper rather than wider of, I'll just come up with a new mechanism. I'll just come up with a new tactic. And that is good for the good people and terrible for the terrible people because you, you can't, you can't innovate. You can't innovate and outrun it fast enough 'cause the economics don't make sense. 'cause the tension has just got so expensive. Yep. Yeah. I think this is a huge lesson for everyone on this call. No matter your niche, no matter your offer

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 10

> "Go in, just do $2,739 a day. Go, just go and do it, right, that's it. And you'll do a million dollars a year,"
 right? Easy. But it's flat, in the act of doing that 365 times, a lot of shit happens, right? You want to make 3 million a year? Okay, all you need to do is make $57,692 a week. you can do that. Just go and do it. Math. So math is very flat, and when we get out into the world, our experience is not linear, right? And, and growth is not linear either. So let's start with some concepts. Recurring revenue businesses are the, are the most robust over the long term, right? And I've been very honest that for the most part of this year, I've coasted from a revenue growth acquisition. I hit the number I wanted to hit, and then this was, 
> "Sweet, I don't have to put a hell of a lot more energy into this. I can just oscillate and maintain around that, around that pace."
 And I will go, as someone who's obsessed, it's weird, weird to say this, but I will go days without thinking much about the business. I will just be operating on it and, and inside it. And then I'll look at the Stripe account, and it's got six or seven or $8,000 in it, and I'll go, 
> "Okay, cool. Yeah, sweet. It's still there, right? It's still, it's, it's, it's still there. It's still coming,"
 because that revenue was booked and sold months, weeks, months, or in some cases, years ago. So recurring revenue businesses are the most robust over the long time, over the long term. ## The Paradox of Recurring Revenue **Summary:** While recurring revenue offers long-term robustness, it's important to remember that it's not guaranteed. The only true revenue is the money collected today, and lowering revenue volatility is crucial for emotional stability and effective operation. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The paradox is that recurring revenue does not arrive in the amounts expected, and the revenue you collect now is the only true revenue. Give me one minute. Someone's locked two dogs in the office with me. I'll be, be tense. Yeah, don't, don't edit that out, Alex. It's just, it's just stupid. I wonder why they were getting so grumpy around the corner. Recurring revenue is a difficult concept, and I, and I dug into that, a couple of workshops ago around the acquisition of it because it doesn't happen how people think it does, right? And the, the reality is that the only true revenue is now revenue. The only true revenue is the money you collect today that settles and ultimately, comes into your business bank account because when we sell our product that is intended to recur, we are incurring our future liability to deliver on that. And also we are incurring an expectation that if someone says they're gonna be there for 12 months and they're paying, "See the tab. People tag," week, but they will be there for 12, "Week," again. That doesn't often happen. So the, the classic, the map is not the terrain that kneecaps most everybody because they're, 
> "I've got recurring revenue, it's gonna keep coming."
 And then it's a lot more volatile than people think, and volatility is the thing we must lower. So this is the most important sentence that I will say in the, in this section ============================================================ # SOURCE FILE: all_transcripts_combined_part_6.txt

- ```txt ## Congratulations on Engagement **Summary:** James Kemp discusses his recent engagement and the nuances of relationship labels in the modern world. Video Source:* Authority workshop.txt **Content:** We were joking this morning in the modern world. you have girlfriend, you have, partner, you have all these words, and you never quite know what fits and when I call her my partner. I just feel it's my homosexual life partner. and go. Doesn't seem quite fitting, so Fiance's just. I think so. ## Book Funnels: What They Are and What They Aren't **Summary:** James Kemp explains the purpose of a client-getting book, emphasizing its role in selling a simple idea and creating customers who can be converted into clients. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Gonna talk about books! What they are, what they aren't as I think the idea that people have in their head of what a book is, I believe, stops most people starting. and the what they can do and what you need to add to them to get to turn them into a long term. Asset is is powerful. So what a book is and isn't. And I, this is this is the big one because I got stuck here., back in the day of this is a book. and this is a client. The the reference we're talking about today is a client getting book. It is not your autobiography by Walter Isaacson. That's not one that you give to your grandmother. It's not one that you read to your kids. It is not your life story. Maybe one day you'll do that. The the goal of this book is to sell them on a simple idea. And that's why the definition of this book can be brought down to, a 30 to 50 page book that someone consumes and sells them on the idea. And in many cases I've seen and also done converting a long lead magnet into a short book. Because it already works can be an effective way of thinking about it as well. The second piece of what the book does is it sells an idea. The goal of the book is to sell just one of your ideas right? And you, you all of you, have more than one. ## The Power of a Book: Selling Ideas and Creating Customers **Summary:** A book effectively sells an idea, making potential clients more receptive to the author. It also creates a customer base that can be nurtured into long-term clients through further engagement and offers. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So once someone has bought into the idea that makes them more likely to buy into you., I talk a lot about we sell ideas first, st and we sell. we sell clients. Second. but the book is there to sell them on the idea. So the book doesn't hold back from the things that are required to sell the to sell the idea. It has everything it needs to sell the idea. But that's that's the only goal of it. And of course, in the in the sovereign world. What a book does is it creates a customer. Once a book is sold it creates a customer, and we turn those customers into clients. The book fulfills more of the criteria, just workshops do or or anything that's got a high level of consumption. The more time on Brand, and the more time that someone spends consuming you, consuming your ideas. the easier they are to convert into becoming a client, and the longer they stay in your world. . We've been talking a little bit over the last couple of weeks about content. my Youtube strategy and my video strategy. And that's about, brand Width, it's about getting people on brand and consuming one or some or all of the ideas that you have. So by the time that they're reaching out, or you're having a conversation about an offer

. the easier they are to convert into becoming a client, and the longer they stay in your world. . We've been talking a little bit over the last couple of weeks about content. my Youtube strategy and my video strategy. And that's about, brand Width, it's about getting people on brand and consuming one or some or all of the ideas that you have. So by the time that they're reaching out, or you're having a conversation about an offer. they are already sold on those things, and you are the origin of them. ## Books as Evergreen Assets and Client Generation Tools **Summary:** Books are highly evergreen marketing assets, remaining relevant and effective for years. They offer excellent value and can generate clients even without complex funnels, though distribution and economics are key for maximizing their potential. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So in the Internet space. And in in the online space the rate of change is super super high, things come and go and they fizzle out and they disappear really, really, quickly, and their effectiveness and a book is an interesting one, because as an asset, it's 1 of the most evergreen I can't think of an asset that's more evergreen than a book, really, because even a workshop or a webinar would need a that can, that they can feasibly run for years, they still need to be changed and refreshed and updated where there are plenty of examples of books that are 10 or even 15 years old that are still selling in the market today. ## Creating a Book: A Simpler Process Than You Think **Summary:** Creating a client-getting book is often simpler than anticipated, frequently achievable in a weekend or less by compiling existing materials. The most time-consuming aspect is editing for readability and usability. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So how do we create a book? It is a lot simpler than you think. The creation of all my books has been done in a weekend or less right because they were. They were compiled, and amalgamations of things that are already done honestly, that the most of the time spent on books is editing. So editing is just making it readable and making it usable. And once you've got a baseline down then most of the time is making it editable, making it readable and making it consumable. ## How-To Books and Mechanism Books: Delivering Results and Converting Clients **Summary:** How-to books that provide complete solutions are most effective for client conversion. Books focused on a single mechanism are also highly effective, especially for problem-oriented solutions. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So I I believe that the best books and I have found that the best books are how to books. They give everybody. They give somebody everything they need to ultimately fulfill on the idea. So they tell them. You tell them how to do the thing so they could spend $10 with you and do that, or they could spend a hundred grand with you, and, and get you to do it for them. So books that hold back create customers that will hold back on you. So if you leave out the secret ingredients or leave out the key thing out of the book. You will find that that book doesn't ultimately convert people books that give people everything in terms of the central idea and the central concepts., indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person. ## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism **Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop

., indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person. ## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism **Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So there's 2 types of books that we can create. The 1st one is the big idea. the one that completely sells them and if you want to get more context on the sovereign consultant and the pieces of how I assembled that watch the authority training in the classroom. but the big idea completely sells them on your whole vision, your whole world, who they who they can become what they need, what they need to do next, and and ultimately how they do it. The the why, what, how, so? The sovereign consultant is A is an example of a big idea book. It's a big idea that creates the idea of what a sovereign consultant is. what they need to do to do it, and how to do it. As they unpack the chapters. So, the the Big Idea book is more of the book than our book, slightly contradicting what I said before, but it's it's ultimately the the big idea. the second type of book which I'm confident that 80% of you have now is a book that's just about a single mechanism. ## From Trainings to Books: Leveraging Existing Content **Summary:** Existing training materials and workshops can be easily repurposed into books. Transcribing workshops and blending them with training documents provides a substantial base for a book, requiring primarily editing and structuring. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the sovereign consultant book is created from 4 trainings. So there's a software consultant the the simplest path to a million dollars profit a year. You can see that training. You can see that it's got a Google Doc attached to it. The hybrid offer customers to clients in the data client machine. So, as I said, I will create 3 more books based on those mechanisms. So I will have an interconnected world of books that that point to each other and cross reference each other. Because I've already got the baseline of those books. So what I did is, I created a training. I ran the workshop. I got the workshop transcribed, and then I blended the the original training Doc, because I do my trainings in in Google Docs. And I blended that with the transcript of the of the workshop. The average hour long workshop generates about 17 to 24,000 words depending on how fast you speak. That's a book right? There is editing required, but you can have something usable and drop it into drop it into those, and I'm going to give you the book and the outline, and in a more readable and raw format. ## Simplifying the Book Creation Process: Focusing on Client Acquisition **Summary:** Client-getting books should be viewed as enhanced lead magnets or condensed workshops, focusing on client acquisition rather than being complex literary works. This approach simplifies the process and allows for quicker client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** This is a lead magnet on steroids or a reduction of a workshop. Right? And again, most people here have done both of those things, and the book is the happy middle ground in terms of the asset that is created from those, and also an asset that ultimately we can put into something that's got bit better economics

. This approach simplifies the process and allows for quicker client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** This is a lead magnet on steroids or a reduction of a workshop. Right? And again, most people here have done both of those things, and the book is the happy middle ground in terms of the asset that is created from those, and also an asset that ultimately we can put into something that's got bit better economics. ## Chris Benetti on Book Funnels and Client Acquisition **Summary:** Chris Benetti emphasizes the importance of viewing a book as a tool for client acquisition, rather than striving for a large, complex publication. A shorter, focused book created quickly can be more effective for generating clients. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I think the point you made, a book, not the book is is huge. I think that's a massive thing that most people just they see, all of the Russell Brunson's, and they see, Dan Martell, buy back your time, and they're man. These books are massive, we've got to do best seller and all this crap. And it's just., that's that's great for them, and where they're at, and their status in life, and what they're trying to accomplish. But for you, you most likely want to get clients from your book. And so the the book doesn't need to be. Doesn't need to be a thing, and it it should just be a a machine in the cog, for where you're at right now, and what you want to achieve from the book and I'm sure those guys get clients because they have these massive things that they're putting out there. But that's that's, probably 2 years worth of work to create one of those assets and to to create a marketing campaign around that. And it's just, I'd rather you guys turn out a book in a weekend and get clients next week. ## Framing Your Book Around Client Problems and Solutions **Summary:** Chris Benetti advises focusing on the core problems clients face and creating a book that offers solutions and a clear path to working with you. This simple approach can be highly effective for client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** and and I think it's more simple than we think. So the the thing from my perspective that I to just talk about is is the frame. So a lot of a lot of people work with you guys because you have a solution to offer, and they're likely struggling with a core common problem. And so if we can just identify what that problem is, and then write a book that, talks about the solution right then and there, and then a pathway to how they can work with you to achieve that thing. Then that's a very simple cycle that we can control and create. And it doesn't need to be complicated. ## Mechanism Books, Client Acquisition, and the Path to Traditional Publishing **Summary:** Mechanism-focused books often outperform big idea books in sales due to their problem-solving nature. A client-getting book can also pave the way for traditional publishing opportunities later on. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Those the mechanism books sell better than the big Big idea books, because they're more immediate and they're more problem focused. So the daily client machine was very, very easy book to sell. It had a very high conversion rate, and it had a very high conversion rate off the back end, because the the this is how you get clients every day is a, a common thing that's top of mind. So the mechanism books are a little bit easier to sell them, anyways, because they're more problem orientated and solution orientated than

. So the daily client machine was very, very easy book to sell. It had a very high conversion rate, and it had a very high conversion rate off the back end, because the the this is how you get clients every day is a, a common thing that's top of mind. So the mechanism books are a little bit easier to sell them, anyways, because they're more problem orientated and solution orientated than . A concept the sovereign consultant where someone's going to look and look at what's that? Just to close off on the book idea? Our book can lead to the book. I've been approached by publishers twice over the years and said. You've got a book, and you've got an audience and you've got. Do you want to write a book? The book with us so. But I wouldn't have been able to have those conversations, and someone reach out until I had a book out there in the 1st place. ## Book Economics and the Importance of Distribution **Summary:** Maximizing book sales requires effective distribution, which in turn necessitates sound economics. The goal is to create a funnel that allows for paid traffic and ideally generates enough revenue to cover ad costs, making customer acquisition free. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the the book and the economics matter a lot . Candidly, you could write a book, stand alone and not do any of the funnel things, put it on. Amazon. Run a basic funnel to it. You get clients right. It can be a really effective customer and client generation tool on its own., there's plenty of people have built pretty okay, little businesses just having a book and not thinking about any of the economics. But to maximize the book and the economics, we need to have distribution right to maximize any asset we need to have distribution. So we need maximum economics to maximize that distribution because we can do something that is the unicorn of of marketing. We can get the product to pay for itself. So we need to plan its economics and create a funnel which allows us to run paid traffic to the book. ## Self-Liquidating Book Funnels and Ad Tracker Transparency **Summary:** James Kemp shares his ad tracker, demonstrating how a well-structured book funnel can be front-end profitable, covering ad costs and even generating profit. Transparency in tracking, including agency fees, is crucial for understanding true funnel economics. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the the simple goal we have for this is to generate enough revenue from the product sales to cover ad costs. So here's the tiny Tiny. He doesn't make it. This Tiny. He lets me read it. Here's the here's the the a snapshot of the ad tracker that Chris and his team do for do for me every day. So Alex uploads the the sales numbers, and then Chris puts the the ad spend in including his fee. and remember that, when you're looking at outgoings. If you work with anybody in an agency, a lot of agencies will pretend that the fee doesn't exist, and it's just, it's all gravy. But the but Chris puts his fee in here. So it's super transparent about what the actual economics of the funnel is. ## The "More of the Same" Principle in Book Funnels **Summary:** Book funnels should offer additional products and resources that expand upon the core idea presented in the book. This "more of the same" approach caters to different consumption preferences and maximizes the value offered within the funnel. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** when I asked Chris yesterday, I'm, What's the what's the message about the book funnel ? What's the how should people think about it? He said. Something that's, very simple in terms of its concept, which is more of the same. If someone is buying the book

# James 3K Code Transcript - Part 4

. Right? James Kemp: The currency is money. the way I do it is unique to me. James Kemp: Emily's currency is money, the way she does it is unique to her. James Kemp: Your currency is money. the way you do it is unique to you. James Kemp: So you're encapsulating. But the core people. There. James Kemp: you're encapsulating the how. James Kemp: in terms of a differentiation, if you . Gieo: In that. Yeah. Gieo: I see. Okay, to build James Kemp: our goal is a million dollar health consulting practice. James Kemp: or our goal is building a million dollar lifestyle health practitioner with 100 clients or less or 10 HA week on the tools or whatever it is. Right? Gieo: Yeah, yeah. Gieo: it is in less and less time, more money and less time. Gieo: So yeah, that makes a lot of sense what you just pointed out there. Gieo: And he, he II think it's always a nuance to our, to our audience as well, because II certainly use., your framework, which was super helpful. Santa saved a huge amount of time. Gieo: And of course I changed the wording because pumping out cash. I don't. That's not the way that my people say it. I don't think it made me think that. So I change. Gieo: the nuance of what they want in in my, in my community, I said, everybody wants money, but but in my community, I think people want time more than anything, more more time, freedom. James Kemp: Yeah, the the core. James Kemp: People say they want more. People say they want more time, but they want money. James Kemp: So they because they think they can buy it. Gieo: Okay. James Kemp: So if you default to more money Gieo: and the methodology gives them more money in less time. James Kemp: Then it's a it's a safer default. Bet that the market accepts. Gieo: Yeah. Gieo: Oh, good. Well, thank you. Thanks for the feedback. And I said, I have Gieo: obviously been working with you for a bit, and got so much value out of this, and I hear something a little bit different each time. And and of course, as I'm building my own content and everything. So this whole piece about what is the core offer. II think there, I think there's layers of meaning in it. James Kemp: And there's la, there's always laser, meaning everything. And I'm, and I'm being overly simplistic today on purpose. James Kemp: because you can obfuscate all of these things James Kemp: and call it nuance right. But when we get to the core of the reason for the offer existing, and you being oriented towards the market, there's layers and layers of why you won't do that. Well, you can't do that. James Kemp: But the core pieces. What are you in the business of? James Kemp: And then adding your own unique. Spin to it. Gieo: Yeah. Gieo: Well, the the thing that I'll say to you before I jump off here, is that the other piece Gieo: just to affirm and confirm Gieo: is the commitment, so I will do what was prescribed, and I recommend other people do as well. So I will put an offer out to at least 10 people, probably a bunch more. Gieo: And I'll I'll report back. James Kemp: Yeah. Got some sales last week? Right? So you're you've got your James Kemp: thank you, sir

. So I will put an offer out to at least 10 people, probably a bunch more. Gieo: And I'll I'll report back. James Kemp: Yeah. Got some sales last week? Right? So you're you've got your James Kemp: thank you, sir. James Kemp: Mr. Calvert. Louis Calvert: Hello! This offer, this core stuff has been really helpful for me., I realized that I was Louis Calvert: mixing mine up a bit, obviously with the aligned offer, the aligned coach. Louis Calvert: I was selling money. I know that's what I'm selling. But then I started. I probably started to bleed in some confusion around Louis Calvert: living a better life or something. So that's helped, but my question super simple stuff, was around. Just a little bit of clarification on some of the things. Louis Calvert: one was you said at the end. There about validating Louis Calvert: if you haven't got too many. I'm not sure if it was. If you haven't got too many people to ask, or just as a general thing, to cold outreach 10 people on certain on any platform. Louis Calvert: Was that with the offer to validate the offer? Is that something alongside that? James Kemp: Yeah, to to to drive a conversation. Validation, validating is giving it to someone who wants to see it. It's not giving us. James Kemp: So it's driving a conversation with those people. Louis Calvert: So, yeah, yeah, just just normal cold, cold outreach. Have a conversation and get to the point to to then ask that James Kemp: that question. That message that you put. Yeah, if you need to. James Kemp:, for some people here, they don't need to turn for many others. They got to scramble together 10 people to to get something in front of them. Louis Calvert: Yeah, yeah. Cause I'm just trying to take it all at at face value and do a exactly. And yeah, I was thinking, if we're going straight in with that message cold, it probably Louis Calvert: isn't good data to only do 10 right, but now I get it. Louis Calvert: There was 2 more little questions. Did that you decided not to have a promise not to have a guarantee not to have a Louis Calvert: something else is that that's probably not something you'd suggest for most people. Right? James Kemp: Correct? Yeah. James Kemp: And when when I, when I, when I look at the nuance of that promise versus James Kemp: the guarantee, if you . they're quite different things Louis Calvert: right? And under my guarantee I say James Kemp: no promises, no guarantees, no refunds. So I class that as a guarantee Louis Calvert: and then final little question Louis Calvert: just going along the lines of the prescriptions. And if we were to do a 12 week or a 12 month community offer. Would you suggest to have any commitment at all, or just they join, and then they can't come back in if they leave Louis Calvert: for 12 months. James Kemp: I found I again I found, the clear pieces. James Kemp: the kindest one for everybody, which is this is to get the things you want., when we've got a big enough ambition. James Kemp: then there's going to take 12 months James Kemp: if you don't want to. You can stop at any time. James Kemp: It's not a hostage situation, it's the language I use. James Kemp: but they, if you decide to leave. James Kemp: then this is the consequence. Louis Calvert: Cool? Yeah, I think I'll go with that as well

., when we've got a big enough ambition. James Kemp: then there's going to take 12 months James Kemp: if you don't want to. You can stop at any time. James Kemp: It's not a hostage situation, it's the language I use. James Kemp: but they, if you decide to leave. James Kemp: then this is the consequence. Louis Calvert: Cool? Yeah, I think I'll go with that as well. Louis Calvert: That's the only reason I joined Syndica. I was II joined because there was no guarantee, not thinking that I'd stick around so long. And then I've James Kemp: I'm not planning on leaving anytime soon. Louis Calvert: Yeah. that was me. That was me. Just some simple questions. Thank you. James Kemp: who feels stuck on what to include. James Kemp:, what actual, what to include in terms of training James Kemp: calls community, etc. James Kemp: Because this is that that's the piece that probably people go away and overthink. James Kemp: What do I put in it? And James Kemp: in my now vast experience most people put too much in James Kemp: right, and that so again, I oversimplified it down to James Kemp: you, need some training and some videos and some templates to get people to follow to a process., these are the things these are the tools. Here's the work I've done for you. You need to. James Kemp: Here here they are, get to to do on your own a community and then calls to do it. James Kemp: Is anyone stuck on what to include in there. James Kemp: and a community aura or a client also. Russell Pearson: Oh, I am James James Kemp: Cool. Russell Pearson: So I've got my current community is the forge. I've got about 20 clients in there, and we've got Russell Pearson: 4 calls a week. We do some one on one work strategic plans and the . Russell Pearson: But I'm looking at this other community piece is being a step down from that, because. Russell Pearson: yeah, the the forge is pretty much all access to me. So I'm stepping down, thinking all right. Well, one call a week. What does the Q. And a. Call look ? Do I do education? Because when I first started doing this years back. Russell Pearson: education just set people running in different directions rather than sticking to a, a plan? Russell Pearson: and because I'm not technically working with them and working through their plan. Russell Pearson: And this is probably just me now. I'm not sure that I can get them the results Russell Pearson: without working with them. James Kemp: Yeah. Russell Pearson: So the the point is, what would I put into a downgrade of the forge? I guess James Kemp: so. How many calls a week are you running? Russell Pearson: Did you say? Full James Kemp: fall? So a downgrade of the forge could give them access to the community. One call a week and the training library. Russell Pearson: Yeah, okay? And currently the let's say, the payment plan is 1750. Russell Pearson: Yeah. And it's a so 21 total year. And if you're talking, maybe 100 or a hundred 50 a week. Russell Pearson: That's the community piece. James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: lots of people having great results unbundling their main programs that. James Kemp: So they, my recommendation would be offer them a one-on-one call as a bonus to get started, just I do James Kemp: have go

. Russell Pearson: Yeah. And it's a so 21 total year. And if you're talking, maybe 100 or a hundred 50 a week. Russell Pearson: That's the community piece. James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: lots of people having great results unbundling their main programs that. James Kemp: So they, my recommendation would be offer them a one-on-one call as a bonus to get started, just I do James Kemp: have go. James Kemp: I'm running an experiment for 5 people on a founders offer who want access to all my James Kemp: all my trainings and a little bit of access to me, and one access to the amazing community and the for the first 5 people. It's a hundred bucks a week. James Kemp: because it's about driving velocity James Kemp: and ultimately driving more clients. James Kemp: And then you could raise it up to to be more., closer James Kemp: to 50% of what the current James Kemp: offers. This. Which is a good ratio. So you're at 1750. So that's about 3, 50, James Kemp: 3, 50 a week. James Kemp: So if you raise that up to 100 5,200 for the community only offer. James Kemp: then you get plenty of people upgrading to the to the forge. Russell Pearson: Yeah, cool and the and so is there any nuance or any mistakes that I could make by Russell Pearson:, I'm thinking, from the scaling point of view, by Russell Pearson: offering people at that lower price point where they just get in for lifetime value. Russell Pearson: I guess it's just the boundaries that you're talking about. Just don't go, allowing them into one on one stuff and outside of any specific office. James Kemp: Yeah, no, just don't make exceptions. James Kemp: which is the key piece to to client delivery businesses, which might be exceptions, but might themselves have to scale and stressful. James Kemp: And I, when you when you can approach the the nuance with the messaging would be James Kemp: very clear, it's 1,750 a month to work with me in the forge for that. You get lots of access to me. Lots of people just want access to my James Kemp: training and methodologies and a little bit of access and and and a community of support. If you're self-directed, then this might be for you. James Kemp: and then it's very clear that if I want more of you. I can just Russell Pearson: always 1 one. Yeah. Great fantastic. Appreciate that James Kemp: cool. James Kemp: Yeah, just to still it down., there's a number of programs going out there right now, 2,000, 402,500, James Kemp: and then offering, access to the community element. And and I'm bundling, and James Kemp: they're upgrading a ton of people right? Because that that easy weekly pricing makes it easy to get started to upgrade to the thing. James Kemp: And that's the Bolton. That's the Bolton approach. The community offer can be a lower, a lower level entry level on the 2 main program. James Kemp: Any more questions. Emily Utter: I have a question about what I'm including, cause I think maybe I didn't quite do it right. Not right. But what . James Kemp: Hmm. Emily Utter: but arcs. Hand is up, too. Emily Utter: Should I go ahead or wait? Got it? Emily Utter: Okay? So I wanted to do mine where I wasn't promising every single week, cause

. James Kemp: Any more questions. Emily Utter: I have a question about what I'm including, cause I think maybe I didn't quite do it right. Not right. But what . James Kemp: Hmm. Emily Utter: but arcs. Hand is up, too. Emily Utter: Should I go ahead or wait? Got it? Emily Utter: Okay? So I wanted to do mine where I wasn't promising every single week, cause. I love to have weeks where I don't have a lot of calls, so I can gallivant right? So Emily Utter: I Emily Utter: set it as 2 calls a week, the first 3 weeks of the month, and then also it's 6 QA type calls. But I probably do a little content at the beginning of each one just riff on whatever, and then one monthly workshop. Emily Utter: and then plus community. And the way that I priced it right now is they can either choose weekly or monthly, 2, 50 a week, or 1,000 a month. That's really low compared to what I normally charge for a mastermind. Emily Utter: and yeah, II can tell. There's II feel something's off with that., I just launched it today. 10 people have heard the offer so I could change it. But that's how I presented it today. James Kemp: Just, you're you're in the. You're in the game there. It's a it's a ton of access. It's a ton of value. And you've been very. It's a ton of access to me. And but I am just questioning it a bit, I guess because Emily Utter: I just because it is so different from how I normally price Emily Utter: and Emily Utter: I do see, clear, higher offers., though, what I decided was, I'll create the higher tier offer later, and then allow people to upgrade from within. Emily Utter: And then maybe in the future, they could start at the higher tier. Emily Utter: but yeah, I guess partly. I'm a little nervous about the people who pay weekly. But then there'll be weeks where there isn't a call at all. But obviously I'm giving them a ton of my programs in the membership site. They'll have the community which I'm still having the feels about . I don't want to answer everyone's questions at that price point. But as a client I want my questions answered. So I'm . Emily Utter: I to sell something I would buy. James Kemp: Yeah, I get that. But if you don't want to answer questions on the community, say you don't answer questions in the community Emily Utter: right? Eventually, when there's a lot of people in there, I would hire somebody to do that. That's easy. I've done it many times. But okay, so Emily Utter: I don't know that just it feels something's off. You don't think so, though. Okay. Emily Utter: cool. Well, my goal is 20 people. James Kemp: The thing that feels office, that you've included stuff that you you don't want to do, which is us answering questions in the community. Emily Utter: I left it, unclear, I said, it's a peer community. I didn't say that I would answer anything. We'll say you don't answer anything, but my people are used to me answering or having a team member answer. James Kemp: There is no such thing as people who are used to anything. Emily Utter: Well, yes, there is. You can recalibrate boundaries with anybody at any time. Emily Utter: And people choose to accept them or not. So relationships always work Emily Utter: private. Yeah

. I didn't say that I would answer anything. We'll say you don't answer anything, but my people are used to me answering or having a team member answer. James Kemp: There is no such thing as people who are used to anything. Emily Utter: Well, yes, there is. You can recalibrate boundaries with anybody at any time. Emily Utter: And people choose to accept them or not. So relationships always work Emily Utter: private. Yeah. Emily Utter: And as you go along, you can change and and and recalibrate the offer. James Kemp: because you're making a particular promise to a particular group of people that you can recalibrate Emily Utter: right? So the first 5 people might get under this. But you . As you move along you realize that there's there's better ways to do it. James Kemp: I'm I'm shifting some of the delivery and the syndicate, because there are better ways to do it Emily Utter: right right. Emily Utter: But you're not taking anything away that we got promised when we joined right. Yeah. Emily Utter: okay. James Kemp: I would if I had a damn good reason, and not everyone's going to buy the reason. But if if I had a good reason I'd take stuff away. Emily Utter: Yeah. Emily Utter: okay. Emily Utter: thank you. James Kemp: But again, it's the core of, if you're clear with yourself, then you're clear with people, and they respect it James Kemp: people might not James Kemp: boundaries. James Kemp: but they respect them. Emily Utter: Yeah, I think it's just new offer jitters, I'm, I know my first people who buy are gonna be people who've been buying from me for years. That's who's gonna join us. So it's gonna be different for them. That's that's my expectation. At least, that's people who know me are gonna buy first. Yep. Emily Utter: yeah. Emily Utter: Yeah. Thanks. Cool. James Kemp: good time for one more. Yeah. Arc: Cool. Arc: I realize where the my core offer gone off. I showed it to some people, and they just didn't get good responses from it. And but I realized that I had and I'm I'm really glad you went over the core part, because I at first had started with focusing on the money, and then I switched, and I was trying to, pack all these things in there. Arc: And what I realized is, II do the marketing aspect, and get them clear on that and the monetization and everything but one of the big things that my focus is the the metaphysical part. And I'm wondering that's gonna be in there, anyway, in the community. But I'm wondering if I should even put that in the Arc: the main offer. Arc: But I feel it's directly relevant to people making more money, getting out of their subconscious blocks and getting stepping more into the power and being able to speak the truth, be authentic. Quick. Second guessing themselves. Arc: so I guess my question is . does that make sense to plug into one of the 3, one of the core steps that we go over. Arc: Okay. okay, cool. James Kemp: It doesn't. It doesn't need to be relevant. Then it just needs to be congruent with the people you're talking to. Right? Yeah.. James Kemp: there are many, many ways that people could get help to have a million dollar consulting business right? Hire a team and do this and this. I have my way James Kemp: right? So my way as congruent James Kemp: to me. James Kemp: very, very relevant to me

be to do this and you could do this through low ticket products you could do it through AI tools you could do it through workshops you can do it through any experience where someone interacts with you these days I'd be much more mindful to sell a Consulting call than I would to book a free sales call I think it's far more targeted and valuable valuable for someone I think it's far more insightful and experiential for someone and you're far more likely to get a great long term client out of that than you are of just trying to convince someone on a 30 to 45 minute call so none of these none of these things are very new but the tools that our disposal to do something about it are sitting right to front of us and so the the future of marketing isn't marketing it's giving people the experience it's giving them a trial it's giving them a taste of what it might be to work with you and if you're in the information expertise business you have the advantage of a very very lowc costed delivery so you can do things and make them make make sense on an economic basis that people with physical and hard Goods simply can't do so that's where we are in the marketplace that's what I'm doing about it that's what a lot of my clients are doing about it and it's also what's working right now Interview with Dan Bolton: took me 7 months to get my first 100K month which is a huge pain do you think it's easier or harder to get to 100K month now I think the opportunity is never been better for someone with skills James Camp the Savant the Jack barley consultant talk to me about kind of how tone plays into standing out online your online content and your personality they're the same thing right my online content and my personality they're pretty much the same thing because I know you I can finally see you as humans we're desperate to connect with people and we're desperate to truly see and not be deceived when you truly just turn up in the way that you want to turn up as that comes through all these different channels and if you turn up as yourself then you can't be competed with but I have chickens and you don't that makes us different people we're back with another highly Topic demanded treat we have James Camp the Sant the Jack barley consultant and we're going to be diving into how how do get to 100K a month so whether you're making 5 10 20 50 and you want to get to that mythical seven figures we're going to talk about how we have done it how we would do it differently and we're going to break down the offers and the business model we're going to talk about funnels we're going to talk about team and all the mistakes that hopefully we've made that you can avoid so welcome back bro it's great to have you here we got some good feedback on our first one and we we've upped the anti of the production for this one oh just a little bit I know yeah just a little bit but one of the things I want to talk about was well I guess the main thing is getting to seven figures right clickfunnels is indoctrinated as all right two comic only one funnel away right one funnel away and so what I want to talk about is I guess firstly how How we did it we did it I think it would be helpful to talk about what what did we do to get there without going into the full back story if anyone wants the full back story they can click the link below there'll be the origin story going from selling was it cars was that the background yeah all of that lots of stuff so just quick recap what year did you get into actual online Consulting and then when was your first 100K month so 11 years ago damn dog I know I know you you were in your 20s then I was in my nappies so 11 years ago sold my first online program yeah and then it took

anyone wants the full back story they can click the link below there'll be the origin story going from selling was it cars was that the background yeah all of that lots of stuff so just quick recap what year did you get into actual online Consulting and then when was your first 100K month so 11 years ago damn dog I know I know you you were in your 20s then I was in my nappies so 11 years ago sold my first online program yeah and then it took me 7 months to get my first 100K month after I went from inperson Consulting to going online okay that's a sexy headline so what were you selling how much was it and how were you getting those clients yeah I had a program called e-commerce engine so back then e commer was pretty damn new and cobbling together all the different how do you optimize your shopping cart how do you optimize the the the page how do you do Facebook ads and those things were were pretty pretty complicated and so e-commerce engine was was only the beginning of when ads were ads were a thing and Google was the the main channel so e-commerce engine was started at 2 and a half Grand so they join you get a group a call and what else just a it was a Google drive folder with loads of how-to stuff in it so a course yeah and then it went to 4 and a half K and then it went to 60800 I think 65 68 don't remember precisely but it was pay once sell on the phone lifetime access yeah lifetime access group grew and grew and grew ran a call every week y keept selling so you got a course you got course modules you've got a Facebook group and you've got a community call once a week yeah go to webinar account on the the classic Sam ovens model but was just pre just Sam Sam was the one gave me the the seed idea of taking the stuff on I was going I was doing offline going online yeah but then later on when I worked with him it was it's too cheap you need to put the price up right yeah well I think it's important to note same with me I hit my first 100K month First 100k month not 11 years ago in 7 months it took me first iteration of my business was everything for everyone I was around 10 to 20K a month for a year relaunched the agency went from everything to everyone to just working with coach and Consultants getting more sales calls with webinars went from Z to 100K month with that a 9 months so you had me beat by two but I think it's important for people to know that we didn't just hit that and then stay there and everything was nice and dandy way and so can we quickly go on the Peaks and troughs of that because I know that you've had different business model changes it's not you've been selling the course model and things that for the years so you go to 100K a month did you sustain it how long did you st it for what did that look yeah so the next iteration was people said How are you selling expensive things on the telephone I want to learn about how to do that so I had a program called Authority architecture so I took the same model and lifted it across to a much more lead gen B2B I was just repackaging what I'd used to sell e-commerce engine into a front- end course and that was 6800 and then I sold on the phone course group calls the difference with that was the I had I started to to have a back end so I started to okay you've been around for a while you've hit your goals you're getting leads coming in I've got a mastermind do you want to join and that was called Authority Elite so I I I then graduated from the pain of starting every month at zero right which is a huge pain yeah crime a river pain as people at 100 Grand well so just

then I sold on the phone course group calls the difference with that was the I had I started to to have a back end so I started to okay you've been around for a while you've hit your goals you're getting leads coming in I've got a mastermind do you want to join and that was called Authority Elite so I I I then graduated from the pain of starting every month at zero right which is a huge pain yeah crime a river pain as people at 100 Grand well so just a quick recap so going back to the price points you had 100K a month I imagine that was you selling 30 or 40 units of your yeah it was rents and repeat and repair just keep going around starting with zero recurring Revenue got to keep going oh you had pay plans but at the prices I was at most people just paid up yeah that's the recurring Revenue yeah the recurring Revenue lasted for a month yeah yeah yeah totally get it yeah yeah so that then I was started to be sold and indoctrinated on the idea and experienced it of getting some element of recurring Revenue so then I went Authority Elite and that's when I hit my first I did 256k I remember exactly because I remember it happening when I was I'm selling a front end and then I've got a back end which at 50% of the revenue I coming to rec caring 2K a month do you think because obviously Cost to acquire a client we've had so many iterations and Evolutions to the online space just to give us some perspective for anyone who knows the Facebook ads world what was it costing you to get a call booked to and then to acquire a client what was that cost so and when I started e-commerce engine it cost about 100 bucks to get a client disgusting New Zealand Dollars oh my gosh so we're working pay which is $4 us time hard question completely subjective do you think it's easier or harder to get to 100K a month now than it was then I don't just mean cost to acquire customer all the thing and and I think it's important to qualify even though you were 7 months into yeah this business it wasn't your first rodeo you bu you built skills there was no way as a noob as a beginner I was doing I was doing 40 to 50 Grand a month Consulting perfect in person that's 100% what I want there was a skill transfer yeah so online is a Leverage is a leverage piece not and and I think people often mistake it for the distribution so I'll answer the question but I think people mistake it for the internet has given us access to more people but I think it's just given us a bigger power l in terms of the delivery of those things because it showed when I could do Consulting one to one but the leverage I got from going one to many in a group envirment was ridiculous because I to get the 50 Grand a month they had to do 20 30 40 hours a week of Consulting right and I could do the same delivery in 3 hours M so I think it's easier now to grow faster but I think less people are able to do it because the barriers to entry are much lower right so I think you can I think the opportunity has never been better for someone with skills to transfer those on online and grow quickly but I think for most people they don't have the skills that are transferable to achieve a six figure month out of the gate yeah and I think there's there's a really easy way to understand this when I first got Sam Market sophistication oven or really any ads showing up in my news feed let's say 5 years ago or six years ago before I'd stepped into the space Sam's messaging was not all the advanced stuff that we know now in terms of unique mechanisms and things that he was I will show you how to get clients online and that was such mindblowing such a mind-blowing claim because no one could make it

think there's there's a really easy way to understand this when I first got Sam Market sophistication oven or really any ads showing up in my news feed let's say 5 years ago or six years ago before I'd stepped into the space Sam's messaging was not all the advanced stuff that we know now in terms of unique mechanisms and things that he was I will show you how to get clients online and that was such mindblowing such a mind-blowing claim because no one could make it and so I could almost recite his his his vsl headline was how to get 20 to 30 clients a month online with predictability yeah yeah yeah it was down to the dollar in the day down to the dollar in the day yeah and so so heavy breakthrough advertising yeah so it talks about the different levels of Market sophistication so if you invented if you if you figured out how to teach weight loss yeah the claim is I will help you lose weight and then other people come up with that same claim and so then you go I will help you lose £10 in 30 days and then it goes a level deeper in your added mechanism I will help you lose 10 to 30 days using anabolic fasting whatever it might be and that's what the market we've been in has gone through and so why it's harder because the barrier entry is lower is there's so many coaches and Consultants that can come online and say I can help you get to 10K a month I can help you lose 30 the differentiator is obviously you as the human being right it's you as the NCH it's your messaging and all of those things and that's where the complexity comes to right is it's not the the way that you get to 100K month has gotten wildly more challenging because you've got to have 37 offers and run Tik Tok ads and dance on reals and all those things the Simplicity is the same from my perspective but the difficulty is in the ability to stand out and convert strangers andan customers if you're playing in the red ocean with everyone else yeah fully and I think Market sophistication as well of people think about if you if you look at coaching and cons Consulting we've gone through the early adopter phase so the people who were the early adopters who were going to be coached and consult they were the easy sales right and now we're in the mass and we're we're going towards the the middle of the of the curve there are more opportunities because more people of different sophistication levels and businesses are coming into the market but they are harder to sell because there's more aggregate supply in the market for those so there's more opportunity but there's also more supply of people who will fulfill that opportunity yeah it's Online education interesting because when I got started 5 years ago it was really weird when I talked to everyday people that I was surrounded by and I said I bought an online course and it's teaching me how to start a business online it was not even a question of scam it was didn't even registering people's minds that online education was a real thing and now I think with the introduction of you've got got even even just think about how something this I can't remember the exact number but bin Shapiro and he's got the daily wire don't call me on the numbers but it's something he has a million subscribers a month and they pay tens of dollars whatever that might be the idea that you can find your favorite content creator or find their business Guru or sign up to masterclass

.com this is all commonplace now yeah so the average person is being able to access education or content behind a pay wall they never have before so people get it yeah right when you're paying $5 a month or $97 a month or $1,000 for content that you can't get anywhere else that's a common experience now whereas 5 years ago that truly wasn't you had to be an early adopter to get it so there are more people that you said have the have the awareness that this exists and then on the flip side I don't know what the numbers would be but it's felt at least the industry is 10x in terms of if we were through it and I want to qualify by we're not say this is the way obvious we're passionate about what we teach or it's the only way yeah you know we were talking about someone before who just got 3,000 clients 3,000 students paying them $5 a month yeah I mean that's insane so there's a lot of ways to get to 10K just there are a lot of ways to get to 100K but if you're just starting out let's talk about models and offers yeah could I just say something about the speed thing yeah please because the speed is relative to the position of the the number of steps they need to take to get to get to the outcome goal so for example if you have the skills then there's one step past that is packaging the skills so other another person can benefit from those skills then there's the packaging of that and the ability to sell those skills to people on mass and then those people to act on the skills and then so it's Steps but if you're a oneon-one coach or consultant and you're already working with clients you don't you've you've got you get results but you haven't packaged it correctly there's only one step which is just packaging it correctly yeah so those people are further down the steps towards the 100K than the people who had just got the skills or in many cases don't have the skills because they need to get the skill get get get results with the skill package the skill so there's all those steps so the speed is just relative to the number of steps they need to take that's why if someone comes to me and goes I've got a Consulting practice and I'm doing 20 to 40K a month and it's lumpy and it's oneon-one and burnt out I'm sweet this is pretty straightforward because it's just a packaging exercise and putting it off around it whereas someone's I've got all these skills I'm not sure which one to focus on I get results over here but I don't get you that there's some filters to go through before they're going to take those steps cuz they're five steps away whereas the person who's delivering even one to one or with low Leverage is only really one step away and that's a packaging step we can look back to this but I want to mention this as well there's a huge difference between someone who's been at Teachability $10,000 a month for 3 months and $10,000 a month for two years in terms of their teachability as well so one of the biggest challenges 100% so I was I had a client U asking me a few weeks ago who's in the multiple seven figures profit level and he got there really fast cuz he had a really decent sized audience and he was asking me what are the biggest things that you find in terms of taking something from 10 month to six figures s figures and I said well you need to understand that not all six figures are created equal if you are I have an amazing client called Grayson who's 20 and he went from 10K a month to $87,000 cash in four months our first 16 weeks working together it's because everything I told him to do he did yeah he knew what he didn't know and he

me what are the biggest things that you find in terms of taking something from 10 month to six figures s figures and I said well you need to understand that not all six figures are created equal if you are I have an amazing client called Grayson who's 20 and he went from 10K a month to $87,000 cash in four months our first 16 weeks working together it's because everything I told him to do he did yeah he knew what he didn't know and he was fully teachable and so that's a really interesting variable is that it's skills but it's also your ability to be teachable and coachable and not overthink things because if you've been in the game for a while you might not have made a ton of money but you have more confidence than maybe you should in areas where you shouldn't have confidence this is really this is really relevant to me because someone who's joined me this week is making great Revenue making great money and he he was describing himself as a newbie in our convers in our chat conversation and I'm I it didn't click straight away but what he was talking about was that he is saying I'm a newbie because I am I don't know what I don't know right and I'm coming in with a clean slate here and I'm going to listen to this this is my goal I've got all these skills I'm already making lots of money and those things but I want a new model so in his mind he's coming in with a newb and that's the that's the teachable person right that is a coachable person because they're listen nothing's off the table here I've got a goal I want to do it a certain way I know you can help me but I'm a blank slate I've got a beginner's mind and I was oh okay I this well and this is the meta skill of learning right if I have a superar yeah yeah Meta skill of learning if I have a superpow it's that I can learn really fast because I know what I'm not good at I got really brutal feedback from a mentor a few months ago and I was so grateful for it cuz I was man if he didn't give me that feedback I wouldn't have this opportunity to learn but I realized that that's a skill that I've cultivated of going well if my goal is here and I'm here there's a whole lot of stuff I don't know that I need to learn and get better at and evolve into that I think a lot of people struggle with and so yes it's skill acquisition but if we it we could people that have levels of open to learning and we could lay out the plan and some people succeed and some people wouldn't and it's not down to the strength of the plan it's down to the ability to embrace that and learn and be teachable and coachable to apply it cuz if you try and put your spin on every s every single thing I'm unique snowflake right I'm going to try and and I I love and hate this word alignment right I'm going to find that the model that's aligned to me and I'm I believe that but when you're getting your first five clients you're not trying trying to get the five perfect the right to think yet yeah well I was listening to Grant and hosi it was a old interview that for whatever reason hosi pulled off his channel but it was still exists on the internet somewhere and Grant was saying you can't go straight from broke to meaning you have to make money right you can't be trying to pay the bills and also trying to impact the world it doesn't work you have to so anyway all that it say things happen in sequence so if we're talking about the foundational things and let's talk about someone's first offer yeah because either they're at 10K a month and they only have one offer and it sucks and it's not scalable or it's not attractive or you're at
