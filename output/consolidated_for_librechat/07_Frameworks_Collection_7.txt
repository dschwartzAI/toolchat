# Sovereign Framework - Complete Guide

# Sovereign Framework

## Overview

The 3k Code™ - Why People Buy
Assembling, Crafting and Delivering A High Converting Hybrid Offer inside The Sovereign System
The 3k Code is a prescription.

## Complete Framework

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

The 3k Code™ - Why People Buy
Assembling, Crafting and Delivering A High Converting Hybrid Offer inside The Sovereign System
The 3k Code is a prescription.
Assembled, it’s a formula.
While I give some variables and teach you how to think along the journey, results will flow from following the prescription.
My job is to give you the prescription.
This formula is designed to be tight and minimal.
It fails if you try and look for complexity or ‘more’.
Your job is to assemble, test, learn and iterate.
All results happen in the marketplace, not in the consumption of ideas.
Most people get in their own way to prevent getting in the game.
I can give you the formula but you must mix the potion and apply it.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System™
The Phases - Essential Stages of Evolution
To generate a client we can break it into phases:
Lead = Someone we’ve earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to

To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Model - Simplicity Scales
For Clients - We have one community offer and one upgrade option.
For Customers - We have one time products to generate customers and cashflow
It is offer driven.
We get Leads and turn them into Customers. We turn those Customers into Clients

Purchases information
Consumes it
Takes the next step presented in the chain
Free information has a distribution advantage. Paid information has an attention advantage. Using both is a force multiplier.
The DCM 2.0™
We take the same idea and create two funnels. Each funnel leads to an offer.
The Client Funnel uses an insight path.
The Customer Funnel uses an info path.

# The Framework - Complete Guide

# The Framework

## Overview

** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model.

## Complete Framework

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

The 3k Code™ - Why People Buy
Assembling, Crafting and Delivering A High Converting Hybrid Offer inside The Sovereign System
The 3k Code is a prescription.
Assembled, it’s a formula.
While I give some variables and teach you how to think along the journey, results will flow from following the prescription.
My job is to give you the prescription.
This formula is designed to be tight and minimal.
It fails if you try and look for complexity or ‘more’.
Your job is to assemble, test, learn and iterate.
All results happen in the marketplace, not in the consumption of ideas.
Most people get in their own way to prevent getting in the game.
I can give you the formula but you must mix the potion and apply it.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System™
The Phases - Essential Stages of Evolution
To generate a client we can break it into phases:
Lead = Someone we’ve earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to

To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Model - Simplicity Scales
For Clients - We have one community offer and one upgrade option.
For Customers - We have one time products to generate customers and cashflow
It is offer driven.
We get Leads and turn them into Customers. We turn those Customers into Clients

- ```txt ## Crafting a Compelling Offer **Summary:** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Welcome! Today, we'll focus on constructing your daily client machine—how to generate leads hourly, customers daily, and clients weekly. It's critical to attack things in the right order: offer, then sales, then marketing. The best way to hit a goal is to work backward from it. Create and validate an offer, make three sales with a Google Doc, create a customer offer that converts 5% of buyers into clients, and then automate lead flow, customer offers, and ascend customers into clients weekly. This system creates leads and customers, engages with customers to understand their intent, and captures those who don't display immediate intent for future conversion. The two key components are your big idea and your customer offer. The process is: lead magnet (capture and opt-in), customer offer ($100 digital product), and client offer. The big idea is a product of your client and customer offers, a frame that catches attention, creates curiosity, and establishes authority. ## Big Ideas and Customer Offers **Summary:** This chunk explores different frames for creating a big idea, including swiping, next steps, automation, and identity. It also discusses the customer offer and its role in converting leads. Video Source:* 3k Code.txt **Content:** Many big ideas become so successful they become the brand. Consider these frames: swiping (copy my success), next steps (your first client), automation (automatic clients), and identity (the sovereign consultant). Big ideas often have utility across multiple products (books, courses, consulting). My big idea, "selling from a Google Doc," led to a daily client machine that generates 5-10 leads daily and 1-2 product sales, doubling with simple ads. Put your big idea everywhere—social media profiles, ads. The customer offer turns leads into customers. Ideal components include training, templates, a live workshop, and a call. ## Offer Creation and Validation **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer creation, validation through market feedback, and the key principles of promise, process, and plan. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The path to a million-dollar business is simple, not easy: promise, process, mechanisms, plan, validation, sales, scale, automation. The hybrid offer is key, a single offer with multiple products. Four reasons people buy help: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Focus on one core reason; everything else is a benefit. Understand the problem/desire you're solving. Validation is getting your offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. Use the community for feedback based on real data. ## Hybrid Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk explains the hybrid offer, its advantages over traditional consulting, and provides specific pricing recommendations for community offers, consulting offers, and customer offers. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer, containing multiple products. It includes a 12-month ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Pricing examples: Community offers ($100-200/week, $3,000 annual), consulting offers ($300-600/week), customer offers ($100). This pricing maximizes conversions and economics, making it easy to get started and upgrade. ## Offer Construction Principles **Summary:** This chunk details the three core principles of offer construction: promise, process, and plan. It stresses the importance of clarity, future pacing, and avoiding information overload. Video Source:* 3k per week.txt **Content:** Three principles: promise (what gets done), process (how it works), plan (how it rolls out)

## How to Apply

sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'

# 3 Framework - Complete Guide

# 3 Framework

## Overview

** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers.

## Complete Framework

Constructing Your Daily Client Machine
How To Generate Leads Hourly, Customers Daily and Clients Weekly
The Sequence - The Order of Events Matters
To hit $1m, it is critical we attack it in the right order.
The common approach is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it's to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it's skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.

4. Automate lead flow and Customer sales and stack recurring revenue that compounds
into $3k per day
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ to generate $3k 2. Customers to Clients™ to generate $3k a week and per day 3. The Daily Client Machine™to generate $3k per day recurring
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
The Sovereign Brand
Size does not matter.
There is no audience too small to get traction quickly.
Actually, the smaller the better in the beginning.
The myth of needing big followings and a huge track record are just that. Myths. Sold by people
who have big followings and gate keep via experience.
You need to have solved one problem once for yourself or someone else and know how to solve
it again.
Nothing more.
A brand is the thing people say about you when you're not there.
You live rent free in someone's head and they associate you with ideas and imagery.
The end point of a brand is to promote action.
When your brand consistently sells someone on ideas and imagery it is very easy to get them to
take action.
It's the natural next step.
The ideal brand does all the selling needed.
Then when an offer is made it's the natural next step.
Creating a brand like this is not easy but it is simple.
There's 3 components:

Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it’s skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.
The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The Hybrid Offer™
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is ‘simple’, it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it’s easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.

. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it. Then you need to decipher all those variables, and most people fail James Kemp: because they're being sold to by marketers whose default choice is marketing. James Kemp: and the best way to head a goal is not to work towards it is to work backwards from it James Kemp: because working fords is chaotic because there's so many potential variables, there's hundreds of ways to market and lot of them work. There's hundreds of ways to sell and a lot of them work. James Kemp: But working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage. James Kemp: because over a long enough time period and everybody's tried that we all have both approaches, get you to the goal, but working backwards, gets you there faster and with more certainty. James Kemp: So we're going to do 3 things James Kemp: we're going to create and validate a threek offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc. And that's what we're going to focus on today. James Kemp: We're going to create and sell a customer offer that converts 5% of its buyers into clients for you James Kemp: in that offer that we've just defined. James Kemp: Then we're going to automate the lead flow and the customer offer and Nsn. Customers into clients every week. James Kemp: So we go from making 3 K. And validating that to 3 KA week to 3 KA day. James Kemp: So we use 3 systems to do this. The hybrid offer James Kemp: which I'll talk about today, customers to clients and the daily client machine. James Kemp: The sequence is very, very, very, very important. because each of these systems solve for a specific stage. and we've got a master one before moving to the next one. James Kemp: and that's the right pace. James Kemp: Right? You may be at different stages, and everybody here is at different stages of the current offer of the marketing of the flow. James Kemp: But skipping steps is not speed. I constantly go back and reevaluate my offer based on feedback. James Kemp: One of the reasons that we use Google Docs is because it's dynamic, right? You can put it on the sales page. And those things later. Once you have something that converts at 30 to 40, James Kemp: but it's dynamic. I'm tweaking words. I'm tweaking, positioning all the time. James Kemp: so skipping steps is not speed. It sometimes feels it. I can just jump straight to marketing. I need more leads, so I can just jump jump to that. But it's just skipping steps. James Kemp: So mastery and the sequence compounds. The better your hybrid offer. The more clients you convert. the better your customers to client system, the more customers and clients you generate. and the better your daily client machine, the more leads turn into customers who turn into clients and and it compounds in action. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate

The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."
 This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings. ## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles **Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened? Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them. Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week. Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed. Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days. It's sexy to the right person. Helping people get their first 500 or next 500. Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event. If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter. Small promises are easy to keep. Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this? A community connects them. You're building a network. What's in it for them? The first sale is to yourself. Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes. Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase? If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific. Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution? The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community. Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle. What happens? We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan. You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing. What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance. Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers. Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: 
> "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."

> "Support to install a system attracting 5 prospects monthly, securing 1 high-value client monthly, on your terms, without being the best-kept secret."
 Example plan: 
> "In the first 6 weeks, we'll install the client roadmap, product roadmap, and IP generator system."
 Modalities: Coaching (discovering answers), consulting (giving answers), mentorship (showing how). I create for my community, coach on weekly calls, consult on WhatsApp, mentor on Zoom. You can sell modalities individually or bundled into products. ## Access to Training and Classroom Content **Summary:** This chunk addresses the value of accessing all trainings and recordings within a community membership. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We've added a valuable benefit: access to all my trainings and templates. Many people want a back catalog of resources. As a community member, you get access to every recording and training. This is a key benefit of joining. ## Offer Specificity and Niche Targeting **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer specificity, avoiding trying to be everything to everyone, and targeting a specific niche. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Are you clear about your core offer? Have you defined your content, community, and customization? Have you scoped out your promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI? The weakest offers try to be everything to everyone. A clear promise is essential. Have you laid out a plan with unique mechanisms? People buy new things that solve old problems. ## Outreach Templates and Offer Sharpening **Summary:** This chunk discusses providing outreach templates and the importance of sharpening existing offers for better conversion. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** I'll be providing templates for outreach, including social posts and emails. We'll cover these in detail next week. For now, focus on your offer. Are you working on a new offer or modifying an existing one? Let's sharpen your offer for better results. ## Niche Selection and Offer Clarity **Summary:** This chunk uses a real-world example to illustrate how to refine a niche and create a compelling offer promise. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Ramzi's example of e-commerce sellers wanting to step out of their business) A niche defines the desire in the marketplace. It's a good hypothesis, but not specific enough. What will the outcome look for them? Time freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things because they're terrifying. Pre-package a vision for them. 
> "Helping e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week"
 is more specific. 
> "I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week"

> "Helping e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week"
 is more specific. 
> "I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week"
 is even better. ## Binary Offers and Commitment **Summary:** This chunk explains the power of binary offers (yes/no) and how they attract the most committed clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** The best offers are binary (yes/no). Maybes make people broke and frustrated. The best offers get people to say yes or no, with a subset of "no" being "not now." Most people will say no to the best offers, but those who say yes are the most committed. Manufacture a binary that allows the right people to say yes. ## Structuring Offers for Choice and Specificity **Summary:** This chunk discusses offering structure, the importance of providing a sense of choice while maintaining specificity, and addressing perceived barriers to entry. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** People want structure and choice. "One day a week" implies they can work two days if they want. Don't be afraid of specificity. The best offers come down to a binary. When creating an offer, you're making an offer most people will say no to. The best offers are specific and polarizing, excluding the majority of the audience. ## Quantifying Offer Promises **Summary:** This chunk uses another real-world example to demonstrate how to quantify offer promises for greater clarity and impact. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Richelle's example of helping business owners with asset-driven businesses) Quantify your promises. "440 subscribers in 30 days" is sexy to the right person. Focus on helping people get their first 500 or next 500 email subscribers. Are they sold on email as the mechanism? Quantify the results of their conversion event (workshop, etc.). 
> "If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one client every time they run it"

## How to Apply

is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.

. James Kemp: So get people to a no James Kemp: right? Is it a timing thing? Is the price thing? Is it a is it a promise thing? Is it a clear? Is it a clear piece. James Kemp: a clarity thing? What makes fun? What questions do they ask James Kemp: again? Clear is kind, clear, is kind to yourself and Clear is kind in office. James Kemp: What questions do they ask? If your offer is unclear, they will ask questions about it. What questions? Don't they ask? James Kemp: What's missing from it? Do they understand? James Kemp: And are they feeling the pain? And are they acutely aware of the problem as you made the assumption that they have. James Kemp: So at the stage of off-value, validation, activity, and action James Kemp: always trump perfection and procrastination. And a few people again, recently have kindly shared. They're working through of that perfection and procrastination, constantly tweaking the offer, Doc, and not sending it to people James Kemp: constantly procrastinating, saying, I don't have enough leads, or it's the wrong time of year. There's always a reason not to do it. So put an action plan in place. James Kemp: follow up with 5 people every day. Cold, outreach 10 people every day, this is easier for some people than others. James Kemp: Put 3 pieces of content out into the into the world every week to start conversations. Who interacts with those who can you speak to. James Kemp: the Internet has removed all excuses of our ability to connect with other people. It has never been easier to connect with other people. We just need to connect and have a conversation in a contextual way. James Kemp: So create a plan? Who you gonna out, reach out to in the next 14 days? What assets can you utilize to validate sooner rather than later? What daily tasks are non negotiable to have those conversations. James Kemp: So James Kemp: Conrad message me yesterday, and said. Hey, I've I've got about 20 people that that stopped that stopped at different times of the year that I'm not currently working with. James Kemp: shall I? We've we've come up with a mastermind offer. Shall I make that offer to them. And I'm, Yeah, it's a good time to do it. Right. Message 20 people, 3 people in the course of a day converted into a mastermind for multiple thousands of dollars, people that just popped into his head James Kemp: that he'd stopped working with at a particular time, that he messaged and outreached James Kemp: because he has an offer that he knows that if he puts it in front of people James Kemp: it will get them to take action or get them. A no, and a lot of those people will say, no, not right now. Maybe next year I'm doing this in January. Maybe I'll readdress this in march, they'll give them the future. James Kemp: So James Kemp: it isn't. It is critically important not only to intellectualize and get the insights and creating office fun and the feelings of clarity that you get going through this process James Kemp: our people can attest to how enjoyable that is when you start to get clear about your offer. James Kemp: but it only turns into something when the rubber hits the road and get it out to other people. James Kemp: So make a plan and do it. James Kemp: Who has questions. I'm going to drop the doc James Kemp: and the template. julie williams: I have a question, James. James Kemp: fire away, Julie. julie williams: Okay, I'm gonna get to the guts of what I feel my hesitation is. And taking this forward

convert them into prospects yeah so it's it's a bottleneck analysis as the :41 the first major hire if you because the virtual assistant is relatively easy to find you might go through two or three but the biggest thing I see :49 with virtual assistant is the Rel L inexpensive in the world that we're in and people are I don't have enough :54 work for them to do and you're you said the average virtual assistant :00 30 minutes an hour a day you're paying them to sit around for six or seven hours a day if they're full-time dedicated to you yeah but the relative :07 cost of that at 20 to 30 bucks a day is very very low yeah so at the :12 beginning people need to accept that someone sitting on the bench and they're under utilizing them but utilize them in :17 the future but your 30 minutes is worth more than their whole day yeah also delegation is a muscle you build it up :23 another skill everything's a skill oh man when I first got started with a virtual assistant I would be doing :28 things that the virtual citiz should be doing even when I had one because I kept forgetting that I could delegate it now :34 I got I I realized two platforms this morning had my old profile pictures I :39 didn't log in and change them it was a voice message hey can you change my School Community thing and my cly :46 profile photos to the Facebook one thanks now it's just a muscle so a really helpful framework that I :53 remember learning when I was hiring this and building this stupidly big team was from Ari misel and do AR's :00 story no so AR runs this I don't know what he does now but he used to run something called the replaceable founder :08 and his story was he built this business and then he got Crohn's disease and it got only work 1 hour a day so became efficiency productivity machine :15 when you're hiring let's say you figure out the bottleneck right so you look at appointment hitting you're spending too many times and too much :21 time in the DMS you go through this process called o a o optimize automate :28 Outsource right so the key is you optimize first you go is this thing that :34 I'm doing yeah is it important should it be getting done yeah is this :39 a later thing is this now thing all that stuff you filter it through is there a better way that I can be doing this to make it just as impactful :45 and less time all of that stuff automate oh this is a freaking super important question now in the age of AI :52 cuz now you're having things copyrighting and video editing and all those things where it previously it was :57 I need videos edited post a job now it's there is an AI for that that can take your podcast and edit it up and :04 then Outsource and the the point being your first response to overwork or :09 overwhelm should not be I'll go hire someone if you're going to hire someone it should be this refined focused super :16 Crystal Clear role your job is this this is how many hours they think it's going to be and I think the mistake that I've :23 made is right now I'm making more profit with a team of two than when I had a :28 team of 13 yeah and so the idea of you just keep adding people in and we'll figure it out on the way or hiring for :34 growth right is typically a stupid model when you figure out what the botnick is figure out is it a :41 botnick at all or you just going through a busy week then going through o a o o I think is really really key so right now :48 do you have any team at all what one yeah Alex VA right all round VA super :54 superstar cool right now I have a VA and a Content guy what's up sh up and :01 and I'm going

. Yeah. And the, we are making so much stuff. Even if you are not, even if you don't have that many clients right now, even if you are, you are making hours of stuff right now. Yeah. A hundred percent., one of the last things I wanna finish up with is on messaging and content and sharpening your content. Mm. I think the best content reads, you are walking through someone's day. So I'll give you an example. When we say things, and I want everyone to think about their own offer and their own niche here for a second, oftentimes we we generalize people's struggles, which dehumanizes their experience. I'm gonna say that again. Oftentimes we generalize people's struggles, which means we de human their dehumanize their experience. So what that looks is, if, if we are working in a market where someone is not getting leads, what do we say, ah, you're struggling to get leads, but what does that practically look for them? If you were to, as the old marketing quote says, enter into the conversation happening in their minds, then maybe you might say something, you wake up on Monday to another week of no sales calls booked. And I've just come up, I came up with this framework a few weeks, a few days ago, sorry, of this idea of surface signals that, that it, it's not the problem, but it's the symptom. And when you can articulate the symptom really, really well, if you can articulate it well enough, people will assume how to solve it. Sam Ovens was world class at this. Someone asked him, how is it that your funnel, your webinar has made $50 million? And he said, it's because I know exactly what happens in my ideal client's day from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to sleep. And so when you think about your ideal clients, and I've been really workshopping this through all of my messaging through sales pages, VSL, offer doc, do not generalize where you can get specific. So don't say, not getting enough leads or, you're not sell, you're not getting enough clients. It's, you just got, you just got back from a sales conversation and you've got another, you got another, let me think about it. Right? That's real. People can feel that. Or you've been checking Stripe a crack addict and still nothing's coming through. You're trying to find that visceral sense of emotion where people feel seen. And then on the flip side, what is the transformation that you offer? What does that look on the other side? Well, you wake up on Monday with, with three to five calendar, three to five sales calls already booked on your calendar with dream prospects. So instead of just saying, we go from no leads to leads, from no calls to calls, you try and, make it more specific, make it more real. And I, I've just observed for this, when, when I really focus in on this, people think that I'm speaking directly to them, right? When, when I was a preacher and we would speak on stage, the best compliment you could ever get is someone says, man, it felt, it felt you're speaking just to me. And the best content creates that connection. And so just this idea of pain signals, what are the signals and the symptoms that they're experiencing, how does that show up in their life that shows that they're stuck or misaligned or not where they wanna be? Right? Then dream signals. What are the things they want to feel? What do they want their calendar to look ? What do they want their life to feel ? And the more specific you can get it, when you disappear from the, the general, you're not losing weight

# sales Framework - Complete Guide

# sales Framework

## Overview

** This chunk outlines the eight key steps to building a sovereign consultancy, from committing to your time to automating lead flow and stacking recurring revenue.

## Complete Framework

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

. James Kemp: and it's optimal to have a growth offer that a client can continue with at the conclusion. But it's not essential if you just want clients. Now, when you want to get started and and you want to get rolling anything. Making the offer is the most important thing. James Kemp: the James Kemp: one mindset that is very useful to inhabit in the world of help. Whether you're a consultant, a mentor, a coach, or a service provider. James Kemp: is that the offer and the promise you're about to make already exist in the marketplace. In some form, right? James Kemp: Desire is everywhere. James Kemp: People want things that they don't have right now all over the shop. James Kemp: Right? Problems are everywhere. James Kemp: People want stuff to go away and be solved for all over the place, and more desire, and more problems are created than solutions. every single day. James Kemp: so opportunity is bottomless, and the central key to speed of conversion James Kemp: is turning existing desire into immediate demand. James Kemp: If you watch the the call that I had with Lana earlier in the week, we talk about what's already present in the marketplace. James Kemp: What's already? What's already happening? What do people want right now and then? We're just looking for something that meets that existing desire, and that demand. James Kemp: and the more pressing the problem. James Kemp: the more acute and immediate. That demand will be James Kemp: right if you turned up. If someone had got their leg chopped off. And you said, Do you want me to stop the bleeding? You don't need to send them a Google Doc and put them on a 45 min call to put them through a sales process to get. Forget them to say yes, please. I'd you to stop the bleeding right and and metaphorically, there are people in your that match. The skill set that you've got out in the marketplace, bleeding or pining for things that they don't currently have. James Kemp: So it sounds so trite and overly simple. James Kemp: We sell things that people want and especially in James Kemp: the coaching and consulting and expert market. James Kemp: Most people have a really difficult time of getting out of the way of the of ideals, and you hear this in language . James Kemp: they need to have this, and they should have this, and they must want this, which are projections out into a marketplace James Kemp: of James Kemp: knowledge that you possess, that the market doesn't yet possess. Oh, you need you. You should have a Crm. And you're dude. I've got 5 clients, I can, name them, and I know their birthdays. But, to a Crm expert you need a Crm, because that's just what happens. That's what you need to organize things. They don't. They need something right now, and offers that offers that work meet that James Kemp: meet that market right there. James Kemp: The 2 central killers of offers that people don't want the thing that you're selling. James Kemp: Coaches are notorious for making things for themselves, and then thinking that everybody else should want it. James Kemp: And it's not clear what outcome they get. James Kemp: So we simply solve for this. And this is a requirement of much as a surrender requirement rather than a force requirement. We solve for this by having a hypothesis developed from real world data or experience. And that is, people are already buying this off someone else. That is a positive market signal they've asked. They've asked you for it before. That is a positive market signal

Yesterday Andrew asked:
"I don't have any customers yet, let alone clients. I'm literally just starting my consulting journey and don't plan to launch until Feb next year. Is the content you're offering of value to me at such an early stage? I could be wrong but It feels like content your offering is for businesses further down the path."
My answer?
"It’s the fundamentals. Everyone needs those no matter the stage.
Start with the Offer Code in the bundle and you’ll have a better grounding than 98% of consultants."
In over a decade of consulting I have seen very, very few businesses consistently apply the fundamentals.
Every time I consult to a large business it's usually re-installing the fundamentals they lost through complexity, expansion and sabotage through boredom.
The fundamentals of a great offer.
A natural sales process.
And magnetic marketing.
Whether you're just getting started or making millions, I'm willing to bet there's a gap in the flow.
It's showing up in one of the three phases:
Not enough Sales Conversion.
Not Enough Lead Conversion.
Not enough Lead Flow.
Sales conversion is solved with the Offer Code.
Lead Conversion with Customers to Clients.
Lead flow with the Daily Client Machine.
All in the ultimate Black Friday Bundle.

example with the headline "This Gdoc Generated $802,000 in Sales without a call..." and an image of a desk setup]
Ad Copy:
This Gdoc Generated $802,000 in Sales without a call...
Back in 2020 a little global emergency meant I had to stop sales calls.
For 7 years I had exclusively sold my services and consulting on the phone.
It was grind but it worked.
In 2020, I was forced to get on a plane and hunker down in the country of my birth for a little bit.
With 2 young kids shut in a tiny house, sales calls weren't happening.
I wrote an offer up on a GDoc and sent it via email and chat.
It took a few iterations but eventually I nailed it.
After selling 100 units via FB messenger and email, I automated the whole sales process and all told this document generated $802,000 in sales.
I've used these principles over and over since and haven't done a sales call in 3 years while selling millions in consulting and services.
The template I'm giving you for free is part of a paid training I have called The Offer Code.
You know how this works:
If I show you the good stuff and how it works, you might want to become a client or purchase one of my trainings.
Or you can just grab my free stuff and win either way.
The Offer Code breaks down how to sell coaching, consulting and services at any price point without getting on the phone.
The principles are based off something I call The Offer Diamond.

If your offer has them, it sells.
The five principles in the Diamond are:
1: Promise 2: Guarantee 3: Scarcity 4: Bonuses 5: Payments
Each principle feeds into the other cumulating in a high converting offer.
It's easier to show demonstrate with an

. James Kemp: You're very, very clear about what you deliver. So it's very scalable, and scalability is in delivery, not in the sales and marketing. James Kemp: And does your offer have a promise to plan and a price with a clear Roi! James Kemp: So skipping ahead, of course, you've just all written a Google Doc offer in the last 37 min. James Kemp: and now you have a first draft of an offer inside there. James Kemp: So your goal should I correct the grammar as I go along? Or is that word. Your goal is to get that offer in front of 10 people and validate it with 3 sales. James Kemp: So during this time you'll be listening intently to feedback from prospects. The validation phase is about learning that outcome that we want in terms of validation of sales. James Kemp: but the learning is where people say no when they have objections where they have questions, and for to update the offer. James Kemp: because it's dynamic again. every time I open the syndicate there's probably one or 2 small tweaks James Kemp: that offer. So even though I've sold it hundreds of times in different iterations. James Kemp: I'm always tweaking the offer to get more clarity into it right so to validate. Audit your audience assets. James Kemp: I do not want to hear that people don't have an audience. James Kemp: Everybody has an audience. They just have different names for it. James Kemp: You have a network, you have a reputation. James Kemp: you have things you have people that you can talk to. that you can validate. So. James Kemp: clients, you haven't closed in the past once to 2 months. Former clients. James Kemp: an email database. So do social media messages, your current advertising partners and networks. James Kemp: 10 people. That's all we want to validate something. James Kemp: If you can think of the first 2 people that you put, a community and consulting offer in front. James Kemp: You're you're a couple of, about 5 min of thinking away from getting to the 10. James Kemp: Everybody has people that they can put office in front of. James Kemp: In a simple way. James Kemp: We send them a simple message. James Kemp: I'm opening the doors for 5 people to work with me to get the promise in James Kemp: the time it takes. James Kemp: I've made it easy to get started for $100 a week. Shall I send you the details? So we use the pricing as a hook. James Kemp: and we start a conversation because the conversation is where it gets the insights. James Kemp: so create a conversation around. The offer is the promise meaningful to them.

> "Yeah, have access to all my trainings on a recurring basis,"
 and with nothing else there. What will that do? I don't know. Will it create a whole cohort of buyers? Yes, it will. What will those buyers do? We will see. What behaviors do they undertake? Do people buy my trainings, and then do a portion of those people then buy one-on-one hours over the top, so they skip out the group components? Possibly. Maybe that's happening at the moment where people are bundling together on their own by buying access to some of my content, but also buying one-on-one hours with me, and skipping over the group component that we have in the Syndicate. For them, that value equation is the most efficient at the relative price point. ## Unbundling for Client Empowerment and Flexibility **Summary:** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages. He emphasizes the importance of offering scalable products and being open to how clients choose to combine them, recognizing that different combinations will appeal to different individuals. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Unbundling allows our audience and our clients and our customers to access the value that they see fit, and as long as we are prepared to do it and prepared to offer it because it's scalable to us, then they can assemble that for us with low complexity. I don't have a preference for what 90% of people buy off me until I do have a preference in terms of, I can help advise them what's the best path to go in. So that means that by unbundling, I allow people to choose their own adventure and assemble things that I can't see. A training plus a one-on-one component would be highly valuable to one person, but highly risky for someone else because they wouldn't be able to extract the value fast enough relative to where they are. So it comes back to us being able to unbundle, and our clients being able to see the value equation and tip it in their favor. ## Addressing Client Objections and Diagnosing Value Equations **Summary:** James discusses how to handle client objections related to price by diagnosing their individual value equations. He emphasizes asking clients what they're trying to achieve rather than directly addressing their price concerns, as this provides valuable context for understanding their needs. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** As with any sales conversation, you're diagnosing their own value equation. So what do they say? What do they perceive value in? I've purposely avoided upselling and downselling because it's part of a sales process, whereas this is part of a productization process. What you're looking for is them to put the truth on the table as to where they perceive value. And then you've got the option to present how you would deliver against that value. I'll give you two real examples. When I launched the Circle, I said to two people, "You don't need it." One person said, 
> "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it."
