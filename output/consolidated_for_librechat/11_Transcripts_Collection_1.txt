# James 3K Code Transcript - Part 5 & Customers To Clients

. James Kemp: It doesn't. It doesn't need to be relevant. Then it just needs to be congruent with the people you're talking to. Right? Yeah.. James Kemp: there are many, many ways that people could get help to have a million dollar consulting business right? Hire a team and do this and this. I have my way James Kemp: right? So my way as congruent James Kemp: to me. James Kemp: very, very relevant to me. And then I just make the assumption that it's congruent to James Kemp: a lot of other people Arc: right? And then, Val, and then it's validated through the market. James Kemp: Yeah. And and remember, remember. the more polarizing. James Kemp: the more polarity something has. the more strongly something repels, the more strongly it attracts James Kemp: in every single case right? But people try and vanilla and distill and things and go. James Kemp: yeah, yeah, it's just this other thing. But if it's nothing anything else. That's the reason people buy it. James Kemp: There has to be a level of polarity in there. How much James Kemp: is down to the individual, and how much they can consistently do that. Arc: Gotcha. Okay? Arc: Alright. Thank you that. Yeah. II noticed to the the asterisk thing where I put form your ethical call. And I was, no, it's just a cold. Doesn't have to be ethical at all. Can just be a cold. James Kemp: exactly Arc: cool. Thank you. James Kemp: Okay, tame. I think we're done unless anyone's got any more questions. James Kemp: The James Kemp: all your blocks. and deciding what your core is. and putting the offer together, etc., are internal. James Kemp: . I have purposely oversimplified this training. James Kemp: because James Kemp: when when there's no other excuses but the ones that you give yourself James Kemp: fan you're getting closer to being able to do it. James Kemp: And everyone here, everyone who's put it, put an offer together and put it down the marketplace. And there's things to test, the the fear of rejection, and all these pieces. James Kemp: But if you have a core. James Kemp: you put together a promise. James Kemp: you have a clear plan that you take them through, and you include those things. James Kemp: You are stacking the deck in your favor. James Kemp: and that's that's that's the name of the game. James Kemp: James Kemp: I purposely not paying lip service to your internal emotional objections to this. James Kemp: They are going to be there, no matter what. and we can help you get over them. James Kemp: Maybe you could just drink a big glass of concrete and harden the fuck up and go make an offer. But that's just me. James Kemp: Okay, pigs James Kemp: love you. and I'll see you tomorrow.

Customers To Clients How To Generate Customers, Cashflow and Clients Fast The Power Ladder The realities of market dynamics can frustrate or be embraced. Not everybody is going to buy your stuff. In fact, very few will. The key to leverage is identifying who is likely to firstly, buy, then who will make a custom of buying (customer) and who would find further access to you useful (client) What people say and what people do are very different things. Many people in your addressable market can intend to work with you in the future. Hanging on this hope will sustain you for a little then depress you when it’s not fulfilled. Many businesses go crazy and broke trying to ‘educate’ and ‘nurture’ their market when making an offer presents the simplest shortcut. The strongest intent demonstration is the act of purchasing. This gives you a signal to tune into and explore the intent behind that commitment. My Business Model - August 2023 Built on The Sovereign Principles and deploying the correct modality via the correct channel: Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them. ● Consulting - Giving someone the answer. ● Mentorship -Showing someone how I would do it ● Creator - Conjuring of original ideas ● Curator - Assembly of the best ideas If, then: If I share good content on social and make it easy and natural to join my email list I will grow my leads daily If I create great products for clients then customers will purchase them and a few will naturally see that it’s worth joining The Syndicate If I make it easy to get started in The Syndicate with pricing economics I will maximize client experience and LTV naturally by unbundling and having dynamic offers. If I build a great client base and establish great relationships, I will naturally find partners to work with for a very long time Products: Dynamic Products Economics: Dynamic Pricing Dynamic pricing allows the highest flexibility for clients to choose the speed they move at. More access allows more speed. Observations: Adding 1:1 component is the fastest route to raise LTV for those with group programs ● Using pricing economics weekly pricing is the fastest route to increase volume for group programs The Flow: From Customer to Client 1. Create an offer and sell it to your audience 2. Deliver the offer and invite those who purchased it to become clients 3. Profit Creating A Customer Offer A customer offer simply creates a customer via a purchase. The price is not irrelevant but it’s relatively unimportant. The act of purchasing at any dollar value is a trust signal. Ideal Components 1. Training and Templates 2. Live Workshop 3. Call (if looking for volume) Choosing It Guidelines: Solve a single problem, deliver a single result ● Sell them what they want, give them what they need ● Magic pills sell in large numbers ● Repurpose - use something you’ve already created ● Small sum of larger part Behind The Offer Code: Having a great offer that’s easy to sell and easy to buy is essential to businesses <$3m. Knowing this indicates a moderate to high sophistication level. I felt an offer training and templates would be a good lead offer as I opened up The Syndicate as it appeals to people who largely already have offers and would to optimise them. It is also one of the key things we do inside The Syndicate as great offers are the driver of great businesses. It plays to my strengths, has a high ROI potential and I had massive amounts of proof that the contents of the training was proven and effective. Selling It: 40/40/20: 40% - How desirable the offer is to your audience 40% - The scarcity and deadline you place on it 20% - Your messaging and marketing After the offer selection, the primary driver is scarcity and urgency. If you have these present, it will do most of the heavy lifting

. It plays to my strengths, has a high ROI potential and I had massive amounts of proof that the contents of the training was proven and effective. Selling It: 40/40/20: 40% - How desirable the offer is to your audience 40% - The scarcity and deadline you place on it 20% - Your messaging and marketing After the offer selection, the primary driver is scarcity and urgency. If you have these present, it will do most of the heavy lifting. The missing out on the discount or deadline will naturally drive those who are going to purchase to do so. The promo length is ideally 5-10 days. Anything in that range works. The limiting factor is always how much content you can produce to promote the workshop. If you feel you will run out of things to say, run a shorter promo period. Example 7 Day Sequence - Drip Feed Offer Components Day 1-2 - Training and Templates ● Day 3-5 - Add Live Workshop ● Day 6 -7 - Add Call/Deadline approaching Resources: You have a license to replicate these: Email Templates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQLsbMymv4LVF3364wmElrHV4U9Bd0a6HKpOZSAAk Ao/edit?usp=sharing Sales Page: https://www.swipemymarketing.com/welcome Delivery Page: Ungated offer delivery dramatically cuts down on support requests…. Creating A Client Offer Creating It: Everything I know about high converting offers is in The Offer Code: https://www.skool.com/the-syndicate/classroom/49b3b0fa?md=878f3045152b491eb225eb6f386 0e0aa Unbundling and Stacking Thinking of your individual unit economics is a helpful frame to make effortless offers and creativity. Eg $250 unit. Add 2x $250/$500 unit to every second client and you have doubled average LTV. Sell $250 community offer, upgrade client to $500 per week coaching for 10 weeks, client attends $2500 retreat with 12 x $250 pay plan and purchases. Selling Your Client Offer The key metric, has and always will be, offers made. Client Offers see a significantly higher conversion rate when offered to customers than those who haven’t purchased before. Simply, it’s easier to sell something to someone who’s bought before than a person who’s never bought from you. Offer Touch Points: Beginning of live workshop - ‘I’m going to make an offer so here it is..’ ● End of live workshop - ‘Here it is, please send me questions you have privately..’ ● Offer invite sent out with replay ● On call included in Customer Offer

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 18

and meaning and all those things this :22 feels cheating well this this just comes back to this idea of self-awareness who am I what am I :28 passionate about what are my skill sets what Life do I want to lead and then what business will help me achieve :34 those things and I think if people ask those questions we have you come up with some really hard :40 answers sometimes which is yeah I'm making I have a business that is exists to pay the bills or fuel the ego or deal :48 with the insecurities rather than one in this expression of my for lack of it's where my soul's work my calling why :55 I feel I'm on Earth and I just think for me this year has been a Line in the Sand :00 year of I am no longer doing life on autopilot I'm not trying to be someone :05 else that I I feel I need to be I want to be the most authentic expression of myself still figuring it :12 out I haven't figured it out finding my voice still doing all that stuff but it came from the conscious decision of enough is enough and I think that's :19 where a lot of people I think need to get to that point and unfortunately sometimes it takes a lot of pain to get :24 there but if someone can manufacture the point of clarity of just I'm not going to wait until I :31 go through a really hard season of separation or hit low battery mode and burn out and all that but they just pull :36 themselves aside and just get really clear on what they want I think it'll be a huge gift to so many people yeah I think :44 the pain I think pain is essential but I think the suffering is optional and :50 that's why I think these ideas of mentorship of Community are so critical and leadership are so critical to now :57 because they don't don't remove but they mitigate an :03 ease of suffering right what's a terrible analogy I'll go for a :08 terrible analogy if you go on lift weights and you do we're both done CrossFit you do Fran :15 right yeah so you do doing frown on your own and doing it in a room full of :21 people are different things right they both hurt but one you've got to mentally :27 suffer and motivate yourself the other one there's people around you music status all those things and :32 this is where I think the the concepts of Community mentorship are just there not to take the pain away because the :39 difficult questions must be asked and the work must be done but they can definitely mitigate some of the suffering and that's what I'm in it for :46 I'm not trying to take pain away the same as parenting I'd love to take all the pain away from my kids but I also :51 know that they have some dire consequences for them and I think most parents feel that to some degree it'd love to not make them fall over and :58 stumble and have horrible things happen to them but the lessons that the lessons they get from them are :03 Priceless yeah and I see the same as with people and clients and ideas and these things is if you're there :11 and you can mitigate the suffering and make the pain worthy because there's a good why behind it because they're :17 doing they're they're inflicting the right pain on themselves then that's what that's what I'm here for anyway :23 yeah and that and that is the distinction is it's not about is entrepreneurship can be hard even in :30 the midst of it's not a question yeah it's going to be but even in the fun stuff it's we we :36 entrepreneurship is hard because you you never live up to your potential so even if things are easy on the model side :42 you're never satisfied in the sense that there's always more in the tank there's always more that can be accomplished and :47 so heart is difficult because you've got

the distinction is it's not about is entrepreneurship can be hard even in :30 the midst of it's not a question yeah it's going to be but even in the fun stuff it's we we :36 entrepreneurship is hard because you you never live up to your potential so even if things are easy on the model side :42 you're never satisfied in the sense that there's always more in the tank there's always more that can be accomplished and :47 so heart is difficult because you've got to get skills and traits all those types of things but you want the :54 smart type of pain not the foolish type of pain and I think that's where a lot of people get stuck is they :00 are suffering unnecessarily I only forget messaging almost a few years ago I said :07 what do you think of 75 hard and I'll never forget to sit back he said most entrepreneurs mistake difficulty for :13 Progress yeah oh if this is hard the hardest something is the bitter it must be for me right yeah but there is a good :19 training session in the gym and there is a stupid training session in the gym right there is one where you get :25 inadequate recovery where you over stress the muscles where you train so much to failure that you're not in a :32 point of growth you're now injured right and that's where I think most people live in that Redline State yeah :38 but it does have to be that way it doesn't but I do think that you need to go there a couple of times to understand :44 it doesn't need to be that way you've got to touch a few stoves to know that you have I I'm convinced you have to I :50 think we can model I think we can learn I think we can take shortcuts and I think the informational and the and the :56 the connection Advantage we have in the world we live in is yeah ridiculous yeah :01 what a time to be alive but I don't I don't think you can make progress without as you say :08 touching a few stoves yeah I don't I don't think you make your own true progress to understand your preferences :13 yeah because we both know people that we love that have business that have :19 businesses and lives that we would hate but they love them yeah so we both they needed to go through the :25 Journey To Build That Life and if we'd gone through it we would have just had a different path yeah so :32 yeah I think you need to go through you need to do stuff to find out that you don't want to do stuff or which which :38 stuff you want to do more specifically yeah you gotta you got to do seasons of not being yourself to find out who :45 you are yeah yeah and I think as we sit here now today I'm pushing a :51 lot of stuff very hard and I've shared with you in the last few days I'm if I continue to push all the :56 domains I'm pushing and now I'm pushing a lot of things physically I'm putting up pushing a lot of things mentally :02 financially and and with ambition that if I continue to push on all these domains as hard as I'm pushing :07 on all these I'll burn out so soon I'm going to need to make a decision on what's the next season but I'm pushing :14 everything hard to get to a point where I can Coast on a couple of things yeah while I while I push the next thing in :19 the leg up and that to me I wouldn't have had that wisdom even relatively recently it was just :25 push at all costs and Redline out because I've got a high capacity and I think a lot of people fall into that :30 trap because they've got a high capacity they're always trying to find it so they'd go and burn out and try and do do everything push everything run after :37 everything yeah I'm doing 75 hard and I'm going

.com yeah is that what you the domain yeah I own so many I just had to choose one when you do when you :26 brought it up I was this is so random but you you as in you I didn't know you owned it and all of that well :31 my just a little bit of thinking behind that it was I got sick of the I didn't the whole :36 three Secrets thing I'm a full sin person so I'm if you want it use it take it I'm gonna give everything away :43 and give away all the insights and show you behind the scenes and then make a lot of the things that the :49 digital products are making super accessible I just did a hundred dollar thing and if you want help I'm here yeah :55 so to me it was congruent with where I'm at with :00 15 odd years of doing stuff online and making offers and doing seeing millions :06 of them that it was I know a lot of stuff I'm going to share a lot of stuff if you swipe it great if :13 you want some help cool yeah let's go it felt it felt the right :20 thing at the right time yeah and the thing I want to land on because it's reflective of authenticity of finding :25 the right model is you're starting up a daily email or a mostly daily email yeah so talk about why that was important for :31 you to come back to that and of how can people get on that yeah so swipe mymarketing

.com :36 sign up writings writing's been a practice for two decades I write :42 lots of words helps me think daily email is Supernatural and :49 Supernatural very natural for me to do so I can write I can write a couple of :54 things a day and put and put words out really easily and it's always the things I can do consistently are the most :00 important things and what's my highest leverage activity was always the the choice of Max so I sent an email every :05 day I make an offer every day if people want my help if you want to buy something great if they want to :11 unsubscribe great all the offers are on the table so for me it was what can I do consistently what's my highest :17 leverage activity I don't do a ton of video or a ton of other media writing in the word is my thing and so :23 what's my highest leverage activity and and how do I put that out and it's back to back to email back to sending :28 regularly and it's great you get after being on social for so long you get a :35 depth and connection and a privacy and an intimacy that you don't necessarily get in DMS which are short you have :41 people writing War and Peace coming back to you this is this and this I've been through this I've been through this I want to do this does this even exist :47 yeah and you can have proper conversations and and a different pace yeah the online world is :54 something is forgotten the moment it's out there whereas with email and and these things it's it's an ongoing conversation and a depth yeah :00 and at a time in my life when the depth matters much more than the width yeah so it's the right thing at the right time I :07 love it it's also that self-awareness piece right I was we've been hanging out all year more than normal because we're :12 living not together but together and you were talking about writing this ebook I think :18 you're putting out I don't know if you're still putting it out but and then I was out of this guy called danco and he's writing online and so I :23 went through this period of I'm just gonna write yeah miserable I was staring at a blank page of being :29 I hate this I love putting together quick posts but I'm video audio that's my thing yeah and so I love that you've :35 gone back to that because I've I've seen your enjoyment factor of business go up dramatically we were wait a minute there's this thing I used to do that I :42 enjoy doing I stopped doing it and now yeah yeah and so I think that's just a such a simple piece of what :50 do you enjoy doing look at the breadcrumbs of the past and and do more of the stuff you enjoy doing that's a reflection of who you are and less of :56 the stuff that's not yeah but can I share because this is really insightful for people that I'm still jealous of you :02 having a YouTube channel and a Dylan and all these cameras and this and those things and I could subtly convince :09 myself that I should be doing all this right despite that not being my highest leverage and biggest opportunity yeah :14 the thing I should be doing I get it reverse that never goes away I feel exact same way in Reverse self-awareness :20 is because that never goes away I'm damn cool man his thumbnails are sexy and :28 Dylan Dylan and then I'm :33 I'm just gonna write my email I think I think the same way I think about how much better my thinking would :39 be if I wrote every day and I don't get me wrong I'm right often on Facebook but they're not posts or emails or well :45 thought out it's stream of Consciousness no editing posted and it's that funny thing of we always look at the business model of :51 someone else that

# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 5

## Q&A: Organic vs. Paid Ad Messaging Shevaune Ray: Yep, Shevaune Ray: congrats to Tom for pronouncing my name correctly. 1st of all. I just had a quick one, and sorry I'm out getting ice cream. I didn't think I'd get on. Shevaune Ray: So you were saying that with paid ads when you started differentiating who you were talking to by saying, coaches versus consultants, that Shevaune Ray: your paid ad spend bent down when you're using these in an organic way, or with your existing audience, did it convert better when you did that as well. James Kemp: No. Shevaune Ray: Okay. James Kemp: But that's self-fulfilling, right? Because the majority of my audience I've already got as James Kemp: self-selected by being those people. Anyway. James Kemp: Yeah, I don't tend to Co. In content. I don't tend to speak to a specific category or identity too much. But in ads, they're showing them to so many different people James Kemp: right? The filter that you go past it is this for me, has to be a lot more explicit and standing out in in most cases. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that's it's something I've been playing with in my Shevaune Ray: wording. And how I speak to people. I it's so all over the place. Sometimes when I'm targeting Shevaune Ray: and I'm not specific, I can convert crazy. Sometimes Shevaune Ray: those saying the same things just doesn't do anything, and I don't know if it's the market, or it's me, or it's how I'm saying it. But I have realized that Shevaune Ray: I need to unbundle my products more because I was doing exactly what you were just talking about, which they solved a problem. Everybody was really happy, but they didn't want to really do more work because it solved it for too long. Shevaune Ray: and then they would go off, and they'd be happy for so long that I was, Well. Shevaune Ray: I'm nurturing you, and I'm talking to you, and I'm trying to sell you more things, and they were just, no, I'm I'm good I'm good now. Shevaune Ray: So I was selling them one high ticket thing, and they were good for a year. And that just doesn't really work for return clients. Shevaune Ray: So I was selling them one high ticket thing, and they were good for a year. And that just doesn't really work for return clients. James Kemp: That's the paradox of some work. Is that James Kemp: doing a good job limits the lifetime value of a client. Shevaune Ray: And ultimately they can't act on Shevaune Ray: all of it, either. They just feel they are, because they have all the information. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, there, in most cases, most people just want relief from how they feel what they're feeling today. James Kemp: That. Shevaune Ray: And that's. James Kemp: And their drive and their will to James Kemp: transcend their current limitations is quite limited. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever

. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever. And then we'll just reach James Kemp: the limitations, but would also be missing out on a ton of people who bought in a different way. James Kemp: And also we would buy, we could run, lead, lead funnels and those things all day long. James Kemp: but would also be missing out on the people who buy via an infopath and buy products and consume them, etc. Etc. And that's their buying style. Shevaune Ray: Chat too. James Kemp: And the I'm looking for things sustainable. I don't want to be building a new funnel. James Kemp: . I don't want to be building a new funnel every year. I want the core laid down, and then just reframing it, and modifying it as it goes along, rather than . Oh, my God! The webinars, died after 6 months, or the lead magnet stopped working after 3. James Kemp: That's exhausting for most people. So we need a, we need a methodology and a philosophy that's got utility. We can add different. James Kemp: We can change the video. We can change the frontier product. But. Shevaune Ray: And that's I do appreciate that. I know. I I told you that I just switched over to go high level and I appreciate that about that system is that you can set it up with multiple entry points, and all you have to change is the workflow. Instead of rewriting the whole thing. If you just want to switch something out. James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah., once, once the James Kemp: once we've got the especially the info funnel working, it's, okay, let's put some more offers on the front because the bumps the same, the membership offers the same, the upsells the same. So you're just changing out the front end. And, products, fatigue markets, fatigue, things change, and on an increasingly. James Kemp: quick basis, right? And James Kemp: AI, and these things will accelerate that because people feel that they've got much deeper, information inside than they probably necessarily have, so they'll make very good products. James Kemp: But because people are buying them, and that's proven and gpts. And these things the people who are selling them are doing very well. James Kemp: but also they're on the back end. They're tough to convert, because you've you've given every everybody, everything they needed. James Kemp: And you've you've got true cannibalization. So yeah, it's the. Shevaune Ray: Are you going to talk more about? Shevaune Ray: Were you gonna talk more about AI in this meeting? James Kemp: Not today. Shevaune Ray: Not today. That was the other call, okay? Shevaune Ray: yeah. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed

. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, there's there's fatigue all over right, because it's the same stuff James Kemp: largely propagated by the same people. James Kemp: And, people have gone around it, and so James Kemp: they've they've come around and come back to the beginning and, well, what now? James Kemp: I still don't have the things I want. I'm still not the person I want to be. I'm still not getting the results. I want to be. What now. Shevaune Ray: And that's I'm trying to tap into that and get my messaging around that exact thing because I've identified it. But it's Shevaune Ray: what part of that gets people to take action and move instead of just making them more depressed and not want to do anything. So that's that's what I've been playing with in your bundling and unbundling video, the client or customers to clients. Shevaune Ray: And the daily client machine has been, I just keep going back to those and saying, Okay, I'm going to Shevaune Ray: found something different in there. I'm going to change this around. I'm going to do that. And I think I'm gonna Shevaune Ray: sit with the templates from this, and really go to town on it. James Kemp: Yeah, when when things are. James Kemp: when things are tough, or you or you think, you're throwing different stuff out there. And it's James Kemp: when things are tough, or you or you think, you're throwing different stuff out there. And it's James Kemp: sometimes working or not working, there's nothing consistent. James Kemp: Then return back to 1st principles, which is, get a customer James Kemp:, what are we in the business of getting customers. James Kemp: But most things are downstream from that. James Kemp: And it. It just so happens that the nature of James Kemp: online marketing and these things which are, under 10 years old. James Kemp: Everybody went to get a high ticket client, and James Kemp: not appreciating that there were a particular set of circumstances where that worked really really well. James Kemp: because we combined high ticket and high margin with high scale and cheap traffic. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that's for me. I was selling Shevaune Ray: a high ticket customer offer. And I thought I had cracked the code. I thought I was doing amazing, because most of my month was free, and I only had to sell 4 people to be making a lot of money. And I was I did it. I figured out the thing. This is the smartest thing ever. No, because as soon as as soon as the market shifts Shevaune Ray: all those leads dry up, and you have to keep selling and selling and selling every month. And where do they go after they work with you? There's nowhere to put them. Shevaune Ray: and they're not in your world. James Kemp: It's hard to sell recurring products when there's no recurring problems. James Kemp: And some people have recurring product problems where they just don't identify them

James Kemp: whereas other people genuinely don't have recurring problems, and so recurring James Kemp: and building, recurring or building reoccurring things depend on those things reoccurring and James Kemp: and building, recurring or building reoccurring things depend on those things reoccurring and James Kemp: over a long enough timeframe. Most things do but James Kemp: over a short time frame, which is what a lot of people are operating on. They they don't. James Kemp: And so if a client doesn't need you for a year. James Kemp: You have to either deal with that reality. James Kemp: or, work out what, how, how to, how to bridge that across it. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that was, that was my hardest thing was to turn what I was doing as a 1 time thing into a yearly offer, because I was so associated with doing it faster, doing it all in one thing I give you all the stuff, and that was how I found you. It was a year and a half ago Shevaune Ray: I found you because a coach that I was interviewing with potentially to hire him. Mentioned your work, and I went and looked up your work, and I ended up not hiring him and jumping into your stuff instead. James Kemp: Thank you to whoever. That was James Kemp: one of one of the things that one of the things to think about in terms of time. I was at a mastermind the other weekend and a guy stood up, and he was James Kemp: a presentation of voice coach right? And he worked with Ceos, and he said, I'm trying to sell James Kemp: something that I can do with these people for a year. James Kemp: but they only need me 2 to 3 times a year when they have big presentations, keynotes, and these things. James Kemp: and what we did in real time was, we, separated their immediate needs. James Kemp: and then their consistent long-term needs right. James Kemp: And what he's done is given people a year-long membership. James Kemp: and then across the year they can check in with them and have a 14 day sprints that lead up to his, their keynote, or them or their big event, and, they'll schedule them in, a few months ahead of time. James Kemp: and then across the year they can check in with them and have a 14 day sprints that lead up to his, their keynote, or them or their big event, and, they'll schedule them in, a few months ahead of time. James Kemp: So he's selling James Kemp: a combination, a hybrid of a membership, and coaching James Kemp: across the year and and allowing them to finance it, which increases is revenue per customer, but it also makes it more predictable. James Kemp: So understanding the products we have and the modalities and and getting into the marketplace is, if people don't need us or want us all the time. Then we have to think, okay, what can what baseline access can they get to keep them in my world? And then, when? When do they need me. And and what's the best way to deliver this product? James Kemp: And so thinking in a nonlinear way is useful because most people think in terms of James Kemp: every week. I'm going to do this with clients, and then every month I'm going to do this with clients

. Then we have to think, okay, what can what baseline access can they get to keep them in my world? And then, when? When do they need me. And and what's the best way to deliver this product? James Kemp: And so thinking in a nonlinear way is useful because most people think in terms of James Kemp: every week. I'm going to do this with clients, and then every month I'm going to do this with clients. But James Kemp: most things don't work that some things do right, lead generation, and those things are conducive to monthly rhythms. But a lot of client work James Kemp: sits on this wave where they need you a lot for a few weeks a year. James Kemp: and they don't need you really much at all, but they benefit from being around you, or having access to to those things. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, you said that in one of your trainings, and it blew my mind, and I immediately changed the membership that I have to where Shevaune Ray: they get I do voice notes every day, because that's easy for me. I just have thoughts, and I put them in there. They get modules, and then I just give them calls when they need it. And I was explaining this to my clients that that's how I do it. And they were every single person was, Oh, my God! That's too much! Every person would be calling me. They would all be getting on. They'd all want. Shevaune Ray: what I found is that out of every 100 people you maybe have 20 who are engaged, and of the 20 that are engaged you have 3 that want to get on a call with you. The rest are just happy to pay. Shevaune Ray: just to be there. James Kemp: Yeah, exactly. James Kemp: I think a lot of people just will pay for the knowledge that they can access something when they need it or access someone when they need it. Shevaune Ray: And half the time they don't even access the information. They just sit there. That's been the biggest thing for me is to watch. Shevaune Ray: Once I transitioned over to school, too, so I can see who's watching what and who's using what Shevaune Ray: a lot of people will be in there, and they'll they'll be so excited that you drop new modules, and then they never watch them. But they're still excited, and they talk about. James Kemp: Yep, it's all a it's all understanding. State of preferences and actual preferences right? James Kemp: And what people are buying. James Kemp: Enjoy your ice cream. Shevaune Ray: It's very good ice cream. It's mango and vanilla. James Kemp: Excellent. Shevaune Ray: And then Beta into 12.

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 8

. Sell an experience, not just features. Make the offer tangible by describing the physical experience of the desired outcome or the removal of the problem. Focus on selling relief—a better tomorrow—and make the offer a clear path to that relief. Tangibility and a clear vision make offers easy to sell. ## Offer Distinction and Positioning: Standing Out in Competitive Markets **Summary:** Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best. He advises using unique naming and framing the offer as an "install" to reduce the perception of labor. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** In competitive markets, distinction is key. If you can't be the best, be the easiest. Use unique naming and frame your offer as an "install," reducing the perception of labor. Develop a monopoly on your unique mechanism or process. Content builds context, establishing your expertise and making the offer a natural next step. ## Pricing for Conversions and Economics: The Path of Least Resistance **Summary:** Kemp advocates for pricing that maximizes conversions and economics, often meaning being among the cheapest but most accessible in the market. He advises against high pricing driven by ego and emphasizes the power of $100 offers. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** Price for maximum conversions and economics. Accessibility is key; often, the cheapest offers are the most effective. Avoid inflated pricing driven by ego or status seeking. There's a magic to $100 offers; they work exceptionally well. Focus on delivering value and earning the right to experiment with higher pricing later. ## The 6-Month Plan: Principles, Playbooks, and Client Ascension **Summary:** Kemp outlines a 6-month plan for building a sustainable, scalable business, focusing on the principles of market selection, offer creation, and client ascension. He introduces playbooks for execution and emphasizes the importance of volume and speed in skill development. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The plan involves selecting the right market, creating a compelling offer, and building an ecosystem for client ascension. Playbooks provide actionable steps. Volume and speed enhance skill development; the more you do, the faster you learn and improve. Focus on leveraged actions that compound over time. Everything works with enough volume and iteration. ## Managing Expectations and Pacing: Sustainable Growth and Reduced Volatility **Summary:** Kemp advises setting a sustainable pace and managing expectations, emphasizing the importance of slow, steady growth to reduce volatility and avoid burnout. He recommends using time as a variable and focusing on the process, not just the outcome. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Define a sustainable pace. Processes take time; reverse engineer from your goals and set a pace you can sustain. Manage expectations, especially around speed of return. Slow, steady growth reduces volatility and prevents burnout. Use time to your advantage; the slower you grow, the higher your revenue floor and the lower your volatility. ## Dynamic Offers and Client Lifetime Value: Maximizing Potential **Summary:** Kemp discusses maximizing client lifetime value by offering multiple tiers and crediting previous investments. He encourages open communication about different program levels and making upgrades and downgrades natural and tension-free. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Display different program levels early and often. Credit previous investments to encourage upgrades. This injects potential energy into the system and makes ascension conversations easier. Make it personal and work out custom payment plans based on credits. This approach maximizes client lifetime value and fosters long-term relationships. ## Addressing Client Questions and Objections: Handling "Not Now" **Summary:** Kemp advises addressing client questions directly and handling objections by taking the offer off the table, creating space for honest feedback. He emphasizes the value of a "not now" response and using it as an opportunity for further conversation

He emphasizes the value of a "not now" response and using it as an opportunity for further conversation. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Address client questions directly, preferably in writing. Handle objections by taking the offer off the table. This reduces pressure and encourages honest feedback. A "not now" response is valuable; it indicates understanding of the offer. Use it as an opportunity to offer alternative solutions or address their specific barriers. ## Metrics and Ratios for Success: Tracking Progress and Diagnosing Issues **Summary:** Kemp shares target metrics for customer and client conversion rates (15% and 3% of email list, respectively). He emphasizes the importance of self-diagnosis and using the provided frameworks to identify areas for improvement. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Aim for 15% customer conversion and 3% client conversion from your email list. These ratios are generally achievable and sustainable. Develop the ability to self-diagnose issues. Use the provided frameworks to identify areas for improvement, whether it's offer clarity, volume, pacing, or messaging. The goal is to empower you to identify and address your own bottlenecks. ``` ============================================================ # SOURCE FILE: all_transcripts_combined_part_5.txt

- ```txt ## Proximity to Money **Summary:** To maximize earnings, position yourself as close as possible to the creation, discovery, keeping, and transfer of money. Choosing a less lucrative market is not a moral failing; align your market choice with your desires, skills, and permissions. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** You need to be as close to money as possible, as close to the creation of money as possible, as close to the discovery of money as possible as close to the keeping of money as possible, and as close to the transfer of money as possible. The further you are away from money, the less money you potentially make. This is just the reality, right? And that is not to be looked through a moral lens. Because if you choose a market that makes less money than a market that makes more money, that is not a reflection on you at any moral or practical point. Someone who makes a million dollars a year is not fundamentally a better human being than someone who makes a hundred thousand, right? And in the online world, people link outcomes with morality and goodness, and it means that it often steers people towards places that they either don't want to be, or they have no business in, or they're chasing false idols. So not everyone can or should consciously select the most economically advantageous market. If you wanted to do that all the time you would be opportunity hopping all the time to seek the immediate financial opportunity. There's in markets, for example, right now you'd be selling crypto signals and crypto courses, because that is where the attention flows right. But the reality is that everybody is going to inhabit different marketplaces and positions based on them, their desire, who they want to serve, what problems they've solved before, and ultimately, what you have either the internal or the market permission to do. And this is where we must start, and unless we want to throw out our previous skill set and throw everything away, we have to work with what we have. And the starting point is with a modern brand is that sociological start point. And the start point dictates your current conditions, and your orientation dictates your current direction., think of my path into helping people make money right. I was an entrepreneur, a marketing director. Then I did consulting. I helped people make money at different points all along the way, so I have been very close to the making, the creation, the spending of money all along. So I am in a very advantageous financial position, because I have stayed close to the creation of money for half my life. Right? I've sold things. I've marketed, I've helped people sell things. I've helped people market things. I've helped people build things. I've helped people grow things. I've helped people create things. All of those things were one or two, or three, or sometimes the direct acquisition of money, or they were the direct acquisition of things that give money, customers, or businesses, or audiences, or whatever they may be, right. So it is very natural for me to do the thing that I do, and be in the place that I am because of the skill set that I have and the and the experience that I inhabit. Right now today we have the past, and all leading up to here is the choice that what we do with that, and how we package it and direct it. ## Sociological vs. Psychological Business Approach **Summary:** A sociological business prioritizes your own energy, interests, and desires, building upon your existing skills and experience. This contrasts with a psychological business, which focuses on market demand and data, often leading to chasing trends and compromising personal values. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So your sociological start point is developing the human structure driven by the human energy. So mostly yours in the beginning

. ## Sociological vs. Psychological Business Approach **Summary:** A sociological business prioritizes your own energy, interests, and desires, building upon your existing skills and experience. This contrasts with a psychological business, which focuses on market demand and data, often leading to chasing trends and compromising personal values. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So your sociological start point is developing the human structure driven by the human energy. So mostly yours in the beginning. So I've talked about this, a lot. But the a sociological business is sovereign because it prioritizes your own energy, your interests and your desires over those of the market. Right, it is. You create it from the sheer reality is that the Internet has allowed us to find people us who believe and have the same similar values and similar characters than we do. So it is created in the trust that we can find those people, and they value the same things as us. So this is in contrast to the psychological start point in the market where people go out there and (ask) what does the market want? What does the market, what will the market buy? What does the research say? And what does the data say? Right? So we start with, who do I want to be? A psychological business starts with, who do I need to be, and in the Internet space plenty of people become chameleons in the chase of money. And we start with, what do I want to sell? And they start with what, what will people buy? Right, again, we can choose a marketplace that is, hot and, available right now and jump into it because it's an opportunity. But that doesn't mean that we should play in it. They, we start with what I want this to feel, and they start with what must they do, right? And this is the contrast of the trust that the money, which is the scoreboard of business, comes if we operate with the natural laws that we inhabit, rather than force ourselves into marketplaces or chasing things that we may not be ultimately, naturally aligned with, or ultimately qualified for. So when we get, when we're doing the thing that we're meant to do, I know my purpose, right, and I'm giving everybody permission to find and seek and accept theirs. If you don't know what it is, stop and listen, is all I'll say. If what it is, then, then following it is the path, right? Because then we can operate in a place of curiosity. And interestingly, the money comes in that magical way that the universe does reward us when we're in flow. A sociological brand polarizes, and it's done so naturally, because we talk in the, in the way that is natural to us, to the people that we naturally want to be around, and we repel the others. So a sociological brand serves itself first, and in turn it serves the market by doing that, and it trusts it's serving the market by serving itself. You are the first customer of your brand. The simple lens to look through this: the more I do what I want, the more I am rewarded for that across multiple domains. The more I do what feels right, and then apply a strategic lens to it, the more money I make, the more relationships I build, the more value I create, and the more impact I ultimately deliver, allowing me to do more of those things again. And they all compound, right? ## Building a Sociological Brand: Identity, Mechanism, and Messaging **Summary:** A successful sociological brand needs a unique mechanism for client results, a clear identity clients aspire to, and content that offers glimpses into your past, present, and future. Actively repelling those who aren't your ideal client is also crucial. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan

. And they all compound, right? ## Building a Sociological Brand: Identity, Mechanism, and Messaging **Summary:** A successful sociological brand needs a unique mechanism for client results, a clear identity clients aspire to, and content that offers glimpses into your past, present, and future. Actively repelling those who aren't your ideal client is also crucial. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** At a practical level, when we have chosen and or not chosen, answered the calling, then layering over practical things is the path forward because it manifests those ideas out into the marketplace. Right? So very simply, we have an identity that we can help people transform into and escape the place that they're in and fulfill their desires. We are very clear about what happens when people step into our world. We are very clear about what transformations they undergo, and we are very clear about what they are currently experiencing that they're dissatisfied with, because we know those things already, because they are often part of us. The second, I'd say maybe the first, but one of the critical pieces is having a mechanism that gets a client result in the marketplace of ideas. Being unique is better than being better, right? So having a unique mechanism is a crucial attention seeker and, and, and it allows us to sell the idea of the transformation before the transformation is necessarily undertaken, undertaken or taken place inside our world that we call a client, right? So we need a unique mechanism. We have to be clear about the identity that we, that we have, all the way, maybe to all the way, practically to labeling that, that identity. And we're clear about where people are coming from and doing that, and then we wrap a world around that, and we expose what we are comfortable with in that journey to tell those two stories that A, you're someone who can help transform people, and B, you have a way to do it through your unique mechanism. So you're letting people glimpse into the past, your current present, and a future through the content you produce. Right? And if you want proper depth in this, and I encourage you to go back, I've encouraged a few people to go back and watch it, to understand more depth in it. And I will, I will also do this again in, in 2025 in terms of, to expand on the brand and authority and world building and identity and mechanism, because they are the scaffolding and the framework that hangs off everything. Go and watch the authority which is in the, in the community. The piece that is counterintuitive, but will naturally happen through the course of this, is that you are clear who you are not for, and you actively repel them in your message. Right? And this, repelling does not need to be explicit, right? It can just take a counter position and a narrative on something that is potentially controversial, or is obvious that it will initiate disagreement in a sector or subsector of the market. A working example of that is yesterday I made a video and wrote something about coaching being dead. And it's not, but it's a good headline, and I talked about mentorship. So I drew attention to a point and a, and a semantic point that I wanted to make through the polarization of a whole group of people who want to argue that coaching definitely isn't dead, and they're definitely very good coaches and why can't I see that, etc., etc. And I'm not participating in the argument, but I'm just talking to the people now who are, thank you for reframing some things that I've seen and thought and heard, but I haven't been able to articulate. And can we talk about that a lot more because I took a position on something, right, and I'm not here to argue with the people who want to argue for it

., etc. And I'm not participating in the argument, but I'm just talking to the people now who are, thank you for reframing some things that I've seen and thought and heard, but I haven't been able to articulate. And can we talk about that a lot more because I took a position on something, right, and I'm not here to argue with the people who want to argue for it. I'm here to talk to the people who want to understand that more and how it might ultimately might apply to them. So we take positions in the marketplace that we strongly believe and we can stand on, not to be contrarian and controversial for any particular attention seeking reason, just to surface and articulate things that we know people are thinking to enable a conversation around. So in summary, the checklist is you have at least one unique mechanism, you craft an identity that clients aspire to become, you are letting them glimpse into your past, present, and future through content you produce, and you are clear who you are not for, and actively repelling your message. ## The Power of Transparency and Truth in Content **Summary:** In a low-trust environment, transparency is key. Honest and truthful content, even if not perfectly crafted, attracts the right people by authentically showcasing your experience and values. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The nature of the game these days is, in a low trust environment, is transparency. Communication doesn't need to be good if communication is total. And saying that another way, you don't need to be a good copywriter, or have the skills of content creation, or editing, or making things look pretty or anything, if you are prepared to tell the truth in your content. If you are prepared to tell the unvarnished truth, you don't need to be a wordsmith. You don't need to be articulate. You don't even need to be charismatic. You just need to be honest and true, and people will see that, and they will, they will be attracted towards it because you, you are, you are showing, as much as you can through the, through the methodology of digital content, the true experience of what it would be to be you and ultimately be around you. So the framework of this and the lens that we look through is, if we do this and we commit to it, we sell people on ideas, right? If people are sold on those ideas, they will ultimately be simultaneously sold on us, and ultimately the right people will be simultaneously sold on working with us. Right? I don't do much selling of offers. I do a lot of selling of ideas which then enables me to easily invite people into my offers. I get comments regularly that I just make it look easy and effortless, and it's because of this, because I don't sell, I don't push, I don't coerce, I don't close, because I put my energy into insight, coming out with ideas, helping people apply them, making them work for myself, demonstrating those, and people see those ideas, and over a long enough period of time, the right people say, can I have some help with that? Right? ## The Bedrock of an Effortless High-Velocity Business **Summary:** The key to a successful business is focusing on selling ideas, not offers. By demonstrating valuable insights and their application, you attract the right clients who naturally seek your help. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Right?, the famous question, this is the bedrock of not everything, but this is the bedrock of having an effortless high velocity business and whatever, domain it is. The semantics around coaching, consulting, and, and mentorship will, go well beyond my, my death. But, I'll be there for the, I'll be there for the discussion

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 2

> "I've got something cool. I'm doing this. Would it be useful if I shared it with your people?"
 The "what's working now" frame is easy to sell. It's easy to sell to the audience owner and gain insight. You don't need a grand strategy. Showing what's working now is easy to sell, deliver, talk about, and convert. How do you find people with your audience? You need to be in the in-group. Be in communities this. When you've established yourself, you can answer people's questions. It's a natural stepping-off point. Most people don't contribute enough value to their communities. If you don't have people you can ask, you haven't been useful enough. The value of a community is in the value you bring. You can extract value after you've delivered it. ## The Value of Contribution in Communities **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of contributing value to communities before expecting anything in return. He shares his own experience of becoming the most useful member and reaping the rewards. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Most people's mindset in communities is "what do I get?" They close off opportunities. You have to demonstrate before you ask. People are asking, "What's in it for me?" Few give freely, so few get freely. I decided to be the most useful member of any group I joined. The more useful I became, the more I got in return. People think about what they get, not what they give. Those who give the most get the most. How do you identify true fans from a list? By making offers. I'll cover that more next week. Making offers attracts and repels. It's list hygiene. Those who aren't open will leave. They were observers, not fans. ## Refining Offers and Leveraging Paid Advertising **Summary:** James Kemp advises on testing offers organically before running paid ads, especially for new customer offers. He also emphasizes focusing on one offer and getting it right rather than creating too many different offers. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Should you test offers organically before paid ads? Yes, especially for new customer offers. If it's established, go straight to paid traffic with a lead magnet. Look for something people will engage with and buy, warm or cold. Focus on one offer and get it right, rather than creating too many. My content is coaching content. I coach through my content. I relay recent coaching sessions. It's raw and energetic. Is there a process? The key is recency. The most engaged posts followed a moment of insight. Don't hold back. Give it all away. Deliver the same ideas to your audience as to clients, just less personalized. ## Following Up After a Successful Presentation **Summary:** James Kemp suggests running a group call with a call to action for following up with a large number of leads generated from a stage presentation, rather than offering individual calls. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I jumped on stage last week. I gave it all away. I got about 300 contacts. I wanted to give more. Any recommendations for follow-up? If you have 300, I wouldn't offer individual calls. What was their hook? Doubling profits? Run a virtual session with a call to action. 
> "I spoke to you at the conference. Many are interested in doubling profits. I'm running a call next Wednesday to go deeper and offer a limited opportunity."

> "I spoke to you at the conference. Many are interested in doubling profits. I'm running a call next Wednesday to go deeper and offer a limited opportunity."
 If you offer 300 calls, you'll get 100. You need another filter. Make a straight offer, then offer calls later. A group call is more leverage. ## Creating a Public Plan and Sharing Personal Goals **Summary:** James Kemp encourages sharing a public plan with a specific number of people you aim to help, emphasizing the importance of authenticity and meaning. He also advises against using fear of failure as a barrier to sharing personal goals. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I the idea of a public plan. My primary focus is Instagram. Should I create a plan to help X number of women beat menopause weight by the first of the year? I'm going to stop you on the language. It's not "training." It's "going to happen." This frees you to do something meaningful. If it's meaningful to you, people gravitate to it. Don't tell them you're only 29. I'm going to compete again next year. Is it ego-driven to share that? What if I fail? It's relevant because it has meaning to you. We're seeking meaning. Can you bottle that? That's the most profound statement. How many people do you want to help? 50. Why is that not available? Fear. What if I fail? Then you have another story. Practice what you preach. Be brave. ## The Power of Public Proclamations and Embracing Failure **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the power of making public proclamations, using the example of a client who publicly stated a profit goal. He emphasizes that there is no actual failure, only directional progress, and that sharing your journey inspires others. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** He stated he'd be making $125,000 a month profit by December. When he met me, he had an $8,000 profit month. He might miss it. Last month he only made $86,000. But directionally, he's 10x'd his profits. In the process, he's inspired others to state what they want publicly. This makes them move towards it. Think in flywheels. How can we transfer meaning and vision? What we think is impossible becomes available because we make it available. I talked about making $3 million. I couldn't have done it without you. But we make these things private. "What if I fail?" There is no actual failure. Helping one person isn't failure. There's no actual failure. You can't fail. It's an optical illusion. We all need reminding. I do all the time. I need to say these things to remind myself. ## Vulnerability and Conviction in Content and Sales **Summary:** James Kemp encourages vulnerability in content, suggesting that exposing more of yourself creates a force multiplier for engagement. He also highlights the power of conviction in sales, using the example of closing a high-ticket client. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I read so much content where I'm, 
> "Give me a little bit more insight, a little bit more vulnerability."

> "Give me a little bit more insight, a little bit more vulnerability."
 It's the force multiplier. I closed a $2,500/month client in a parking lot. Why? I had so much conviction. I didn't care if they said yes or no. I knew how to solve their problem so well that they would be the failure if they didn't sign up. There's a post in there. I don't post on social anymore, I do Google Ads. I wanted to share something that's working. I've been hitting grand slams lately. I got pissed off and wrote a ridiculous landing page. It's just text. I go off on knowing their problem. "This is what you're thinking, next you do this." It's conversational. I have testimonials at the bottom. People say, "You said it better than I could." That gets me leads. I convert them to a conversation via text. My initial offer is to show them I understand their problem so well that they can't imagine I don't know how to solve it. ## Closing the Gap Between Insight and Action **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of closing the gap between insight and action, suggesting that demonstrating real-time problem-solving resonates with audiences and attracts clients. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** If you're working with clients, close the gap between solving the problem and sharing the insight. If you're demonstrating you're in the trenches, people who want to solve those problems will come to you. The faster you close that loop of solving and sharing, the faster you get resonance and clients. I'm great at selling high-ticket one-on-one services, but I have a mega issue selling mid-ticket. I have high-ticket and low-ticket, nothing in between. When we sell one-on-one, we make a promise to find and solve a problem. When we sell to groups, we prepackage the problem into a promise: "We will solve this problem." When we sell one-on-one, we talk about specific outcomes. When we sell group, we aggregate the outcome: "You will see this." The problem is prepackaged. The more specific, the more they can engage. ## Selling Relief and Prioritizing Tension Removal **Summary:** James Kemp explains that coaching is primarily about selling relief from a problem that causes tension. He advises front-loading offers with a quick diagnosis call to provide immediate relief and build trust. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** When people say, "I want access to you," what are you saying? You're probably stretching the gap to providing relief. Coaching is selling short-term relief. We package a call to solve the problem immediately. The more immediate the relief, the better. 
> "We'll get on a 15-minute call, then you can check in weekly."
 This closes the gap between future relief and relief 24 hours from now. Coaching is selling relief from a problem that causes tension. We prioritize things that remove tension or stress. We can't live in a high state of stress. Coaching is providing relief quickly, then extending that: 
> "Once we've solved that problem, we'll solve the next one."

The promise is short-term, the vision is long-term. ## Being True to Your Fans and Embracing Discernment **Summary:** James Kemp advises against being wishy-washy and trying to please everyone, emphasizing the importance of a tight plan that allows people to easily say yes or no. He also discusses the concept of true fans and their unwavering loyalty. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Where I've been straying is not being true to the true fans. The tighter your plan, the easier it is for people to say yes or no. Most people build their business to please everyone. They're constantly thinking, "What does the market want?" Most people don't know what they want. We are articulating ideals and demonstrating. It's the handholds. "This is interesting, or this is relevant." The reticular activating system, the yellow car thing. Sack yourself. Create raving fans. The true fans are the true fans. a footy team, you don't change teams. Offers and content are invitations to pay attention. The best offers are binary. Easy yes or no. The best content is binary. Popular people have detractors because they're individualistic. You can't scale things you don't care about. The coaching industry talks about scaling volume, not scaling care. ## Distributing Your Plan and Building Trust Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp recommends sharing your plan across all platforms, regardless of whether it's a personal or business profile. He also discusses building trust and relationships through content, emphasizing total attention time and the number of insights consumed. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Should I share my plan from a personal Facebook profile or a business page? As long as you're in it, it doesn't matter. Put your plan everywhere. People can refer back to it. Is there a best content format for building trust? It's hitting the four points and letting them consume. Total attention time. People binge my content before calls. They need to consume a certain amount to get enough insight. A 20-minute YouTube video might have 7,000 words, which is about 30 emails. Both convert, but total consumption time varies. With video, you move people faster because they consume at a higher rate. We're chasing a certain number of insights. 10 insights could come from 10 Facebook posts or one YouTube video. ## Identifying Barriers to Buying and Removing Them Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of identifying barriers to buying and using content to remove those barriers. He emphasizes the value of offer creation and how it can accelerate client acquisition and retention. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** When people buy, what conditions have they met? There are natural barriers to buying. I focus on offer creation. If I help people create an offer before they become clients, I can quickly tweak it to increase their earnings. They've already done the groundwork. They think I'm a genius, but they did the work. I know what moves the needle. Getting an offer beforehand makes them more likely to become and stay a client. We've already created momentum. What do they need to get results? What do you need to give them so they see they can get the result, but are better off with you? If your content proves they're looking at a barrier the wrong way, that's insight. If it shows they have what they need but don't know how to use it, that's insight. Insight removes barriers. ## Simplifying Offers and Embracing a Scarcity Mindset **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for small, easy-to-digest offers with fewer barriers. He criticizes the scarcity mindset of withholding help and suggests aiming to help people, which naturally leads to client acquisition. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I talk about small promises

> "I need to be a marketing expert, handsome, and a millionaire to become a millionaire."
 It's the "I need to lose weight before I join the gym" paradox. If your content removes barriers, client acquisition and value delivery transform. People have a scarcity mindset about helping before they become clients. Aim to help people. They'll cross the thresholds. You can solve a problem for $10 or $100,000. It's about levels of access. I'm running a 5-day challenge. Should I change my messaging to call out the problem? There are a lot of people selling results, not what they're doing. I see high resonance with "I'll coach you," not "I'll get you this." 
> "Do you want accountability? I'll coach you personally daily. Want details?"
 We've gotten away from selling what we're doing. ## Selling Coaching and Personal Accountability **Summary:** James Kemp suggests reframing challenge offers to emphasize personal coaching and group accountability, providing specific examples of how to craft compelling messaging. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Reframe: 
> "I'm looking for 10 guys I can coach personally to lose 10 kilos. We'll do it as a group. We'll lose 10 kilos each, and you get my personal help."
 You're getting both personal coaching and group support. It's a spread of accountability. 
> "I'm looking for people to coach personally to lose 10 kilos. We'll do it as a group of 10 guys. We'll lose 10 kilos each, and you get my personal help. Details. I'm choosing people this week."
 The number one powerlifting coach in the UK coaches for free. He gets stupid results. He has a waiting list because he has discernment. Many are trying to be attractive. "If I attract enough, it will work." The opposite frame: 
> "I'm going to repel those not worthy to work with me."
 ## The Power of Repulsion and Conditional Pricing **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the power of repelling unqualified leads and focusing on those who are a good fit. He also touches on the concept of conditional pricing based on client resources. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** You can do that with price. If they're millionaires, you'll find that out quickly. "It's not just about money, it's about attitude." That makes it harder to access you. I know two coaches with conditional pricing. "Because you have more money, I charge you more." I've never heard, "Because you're an asshole, I charge you more." We try to hide behind layers of stuff. Focus on getting a yes or no. Both are valuable. Maybes create false opportunity. Yes or no are the only answers we tolerate. If they can't say no, we close the doors. Two people joined the Syndicate. Someone said they'd join, but weren't ready. "You'll miss this intake." "Can you hold my spot?" No. I'll open again. People aren't used to this. They stay in the maybe. Until it's done, it's not done. ## Focusing on Committed Participants and Embracing Abundance **Summary:** James Kemp advises focusing on serving ============================================================ # SOURCE FILE: all_transcripts_combined_part_10.txt

- ```txt ## Defining the Sovereign Consultant **Summary:** This chunk defines the concept of a sovereign consultant, emphasizing intentionality in building a mechanism, identity, and operating world to achieve high leverage returns from a small, engaged audience. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The goal is building a million-dollar-per-year solo consultancy with 65 clients or less, working less than two days per week. This is achieved by intentionally building your mechanism, the identity people inhabit when they work with you, and the world you operate in. It's not about massive email lists or social media followers; it's about telling a compelling story to a small group. Intentionality is key to achieving high leverage returns from small audiences. You don't need huge lists, attention, or experience if you're intentional about these three categories. ## Client Acquisition Phases and Demonstrating Competence **Summary:** This chunk outlines the phases of client acquisition (lead, customer, client) and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating competence at each stage to efficiently gain clients and minimize sales pressure. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** This model is alpha-driven. A lead is someone you have the right to communicate with, a customer has transacted with you, and a client receives your dedicated time and resources. To obtain a client efficiently, demonstrate competence at each stage. While people can skip steps, a methodical sequence produces the best clients with the least sales pressure. Understanding intent and desire is crucial, and initiating a transaction is the fastest way to gauge intention. An offer-driven model provides a clear next step for prospects. ## The Client World Structure: Community and Consulting Levels **Summary:** This chunk details the tiered structure of the client world, including community and consulting levels, and explains how a seven-figure run rate can be achieved with just these two tiers. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The client world consists of a community level, a consulting level, and optionally, a mentorship level. The mentorship level isn't necessary for a seven-figure run rate. The community level provides a broad base, while the consulting level offers more intimate, high-access service. A menu of offerings allows for varied sales and delivery. For example, a sovereign community might cost $100 monthly with a $3,000 annual option, alongside other higher-priced group programs and consulting hours at a premium rate. ## Core Reasons People Buy Help and Focusing on One **Summary:** This chunk identifies the four core reasons people buy help (make more money, save money, stay legal, live a better life) and stresses the importance of focusing on just one core reason for business clarity and effective messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** There are four core reasons people buy help: make more money, save money, stay legal, and live a better life. Focus on solving for only one core reason; all other benefits are secondary. Focusing on a single core helps refine messaging, offers, and target audience, leading to greater clarity and effectiveness. While secondary benefits can attract and retain clients, a clear core problem is essential. Losing sight of this core can lead to confused messaging and a diluted brand identity. ## Understanding the Client's Problem and Solution **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of understanding how the core problem manifests in clients' lives, their awareness of it, and their current solutions to effectively tailor your unique solution and messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Understanding your core offering is crucial. Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing

- ```txt ## Building a 1000 True Fan Audience **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of building a loyal audience of "true fans" who consistently engage and purchase, emphasizing intentionality and quality over quantity. He outlines three core strategies for audience growth: borrowing, building, and buying. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Morning peeps! How are you all doing? Awesome. I will share the doc as usual. Unfortunately, I have to take off copying permissions on my trainings. The rampant thievery has got to the point of ridiculousness. The docs and recordings are there to use, and also posted inside skool. So, 1,000 true fans – the template for finding a thousand true fans who buy from you daily. This isn't just about growing an audience, though I'll use that word a lot. It's about nurturing an audience that does things. A lot of audiences don't do much. They'll follow, watch, applaud, but they won't interact or buy. Building an audience these days needs to be intentional. If you're intentional, you don't need a huge audience. Just with offers, if we're intentional and understand the dynamics, we don't need that many clients. This is about doing it the smart and efficient way. Today, I'll talk about the three ways to grow. I'll touch on capturing and communicating, but next week I'll dive deep into owning and communicating with an audience to get them to do things. I'm over-delivering on the templates – we've got well over 100 that are easily replicable. Use the themes, principles, and insights. Last week of August, I'll do an open Q&A. ## The Importance of Creation in Audience Building **Summary:** James Kemp stresses that creation is fundamental to audience growth. Strategy provides guardrails, but creation itself fuels connection and allows for the transition to a creator economy where creativity is rewarded. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I want to set the scene: you *must* create to communicate. Without creation, none of this works. I'll give you templates and ways to do things, things you can replicate, but you must create on top of those. *How* you create, *what* you create, *who* you create for, and *where* – those are the strategy. Strategy requires thought, but not too much. Many get trapped in "what's the best platform?" Those are just decisions. Execute on them. Creation is the energy. Strategy sets you free to create. The online world has accelerated the transition from the knowledge economy to the creator economy. You're rewarded for your creativity. People look for that freshness and energy. Creating true fans, not just an audience, is through communication that connects. The Internet allows us to connect in new ways. Connection shows you understand them. Demonstrate usefulness and a vision that only a leader can have. Building an audience is your biggest asset. A friend retired three years ago, hasn't created anything new, and makes over a million dollars a year selling other people's stuff. He has an audience, a list, connection, and trust. If people know, and trust you, you'll never lack opportunity. Your audience evolves with you. I've gone from traditional consulting to e-commerce to lead generation. Some have been with me through it all. Built properly, it's an asset that lasts. There are three basic phases. Today, we'll dig into the three ways to build, then discuss capturing, communicating, and repurposing. ## Three Core Strategies for Audience Growth **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the three core strategies for audience growth: borrowing (leveraging other people's audiences), building (creating content on social media), and buying (using paid advertising). He emphasizes that relationships are key and take time, and each strategy has its own skill requirements and trade-offs

. There are three basic phases. Today, we'll dig into the three ways to build, then discuss capturing, communicating, and repurposing. ## Three Core Strategies for Audience Growth **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the three core strategies for audience growth: borrowing (leveraging other people's audiences), building (creating content on social media), and buying (using paid advertising). He emphasizes that relationships are key and take time, and each strategy has its own skill requirements and trade-offs. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** There are only three ways to build an audience. There's no fast *and* good way. The key factor is relationship, and relationships take time. The more deliberate you are, the faster it happens. Each domain has skill requirements and trade-offs. All are useful, the mixture is up to you. Some exclusively use ads, some borrow audiences, some are purely organic. The balance depends on trade-offs and skills. All require investment – time, skills, or money. Reps are required. I'll give you a basic plan with reps for short, medium, and long-term returns. Think long-term. The three strategies are: *Borrow*: Someone already has your future client. They trust that person. Transfer that trust to you. Borrow their attention. *Build*: Social media is publishing. Be discovered. Create content. *Buy*: Buy attention. Buy audience quickly. Build depth and relationship. Define next steps. ## The Importance of Skill and Usefulness in Audience Building **Summary:** James Kemp argues that a lack of opportunities to borrow an audience often reveals a lack of skill or usefulness. He emphasizes the importance of investing in your craft and demonstrating your value. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I'm going to be blunt: a deficiency of opportunity in any of these categories exposes a lack of skills or usefulness. Borrowing an audience is the way to build a high-quality audience. If you can't get in front of someone else's audience, you haven't invested enough in your craft or demonstrated your value. I could turn up anywhere weekly because I've invested and demonstrated, and people want to hear me. This builds a high-quality audience and doesn't require huge leads, as people are pre-qualified. True fans trust you. Trust has to be transferred. Choose partners that cross over but don't compete directly. Don't try to steal clients. Demonstrate value. Calls to action are overrated. Borrowing an audience fits into two categories: teaching and sharing. ## Borrowing an Audience: Teaching **Summary:** James Kemp explains that teaching is a powerful way to borrow an audience. By teaching something valuable and timely, you demonstrate your expertise and build trust with a new audience. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The first category is *teaching*. Teach something they haven't seen or that you're known for. My friend Taki runs a coaching program. We disagree on some things, but agree on many. I'm an easy person for him to invite to teach his people. I've taught his groups offer creation, book funnels, and what's working now. I was opening the kimono, giving his people exclusive insights. Demonstrations of what's working now are easy.

That's great, virtually or in person. A downloadable resource is a bonus, not required. If you teach well and demonstrate value, people will reach out. Teaching what's working now has the highest response rate. It's the fast lane from audience member to customer to client. Turning up might be scheduled or impromptu. Allow audience interaction and Q&A. You're not there to sell, you're there to teach and demonstrate. The better you do that, the more likely you are to sell. You can get clients weekly this way. I know someone who exclusively does this. It works because of trust transfer. You inherit trust from the person who puts you on their stage. ## Borrowing an Audience: Sharing **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the second way to borrow an audience: sharing what's working now. This often requires permission but can be highly effective in demonstrating your expertise and relevance. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The second way is *sharing*. Demonstrate what's working now. This often requires permission. I've done this in Taki's program and others. "Hey, this thing's working right now." It makes you relevant and timely. You often need permission, especially if it's not purely altruistic. Show them everything, demonstrate insight, show exactly what you're doing in real time. This is a high-rep, high-return strategy. Getting on other people's stages compounds quickly. Reach out weekly and offer to teach. Someone has your ideal client right now. This is how I'd build a small, engaged audience. The crossover will be contextually aware. You could reach a few hundred people a year and get a significant number crossing over, with trust transfer, willing to buy. It's the way to build quality. ## Building an Audience: Choosing the Right Platform **Summary:** James Kemp advises on choosing the right social media platform for building an audience, emphasizing the importance of discernment and understanding the realities of each platform's algorithm. He stresses consistency over platform choice. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The second way is *building* an audience. This is much slower and getting more difficult. We need a way to be discovered. I'll break this into two parts: platforms (guardrails) and what to say. Choosing a platform requires discernment. What's natural for you? What are the realities of each platform? Here's the reality of algorithms: to grow, you need to be discovered. You need to grow outside the same pool of people. Algorithms change. *Facebook* (personal profile) is friend-centric. It doesn't allow for much discovery. 90% of my profile views are friends. It has limits for growth, but allows for deeper connection. *Instagram* is highly discoverable and visual. 93% of my post views are non-followers. But it's visual, requiring higher production. *LinkedIn* is highly targeted, but low interaction. People aren't on there frequently. It has a low decay rate. *YouTube* is low discovery, long lifetime, but high production. Content lasts for years, versus hours or days on other platforms. ## Building an Audience: Content Strategy and Repurposing **Summary:** James Kemp dismisses the idea of a "best" platform, advocating for consistency and creating content for a primary platform then distributing it to others. He suggests a simple copy-paste strategy and shares his own approach. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The worst idea is that there's a "best" platform. There isn't. There's just a best platform *for you*. Trust and attention can be built anywhere. Social networks have real humans. Create for a primary platform, distribute to others. The best social media strategy is copy-paste. Publish on one, take it to another

. He suggests a simple copy-paste strategy and shares his own approach. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The worst idea is that there's a "best" platform. There isn't. There's just a best platform *for you*. Trust and attention can be built anywhere. Social networks have real humans. Create for a primary platform, distribute to others. The best social media strategy is copy-paste. Publish on one, take it to another. I screenshot Facebook posts, put them over random videos, and run them as Instagram Reels. They get 3,000 organic views, 90% new people. The best platform is one you can create consistently on. I don't even Facebook much, but it's where I can create consistently, distribute from, and repurpose easily. Consistency is the number one pillar. If you're a writer, Facebook and LinkedIn work well. If you're great on video, use a video-centric platform. I can't consistently produce video, so I don't try. I do what I can consistently do. If what you can create consistently, focus on that. They all work. Be consistent in creation and distribution. ## Building an Audience: Four Content Buckets **Summary:** James Kemp introduces four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problems, and plan – that drive audience engagement and build trust. He explains that the best content incorporates one or more of these elements. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** What do you say? 90% of results are driven by 10% of your content. I've posted thousands of times, and can highlight two dozen posts that moved the needle. There are four content buckets: *philosophy*, *proof*, *problems*, and *plan*. Philosophy is what you believe. It used to be nice-to-have, now it's essential. What we do is commoditized, but *we* aren't. People buy who you are and what you believe. What do you believe? How do you think differently? What's hiding in plain sight? Delivering insight signals you as useful. You provide an external perspective. I talk about congruence. Fat personal trainers don't get many clients. That's a philosophical take. I do what I teach, and teach what I do. ## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Philosophy and Proof **Summary:** James Kemp elaborates on the philosophy and proof content buckets. Philosophy involves sharing your beliefs and unique perspectives, while proof goes beyond testimonials to demonstrate how you help clients achieve results. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** People would be shocked how little profit some "7-figure heroes" make. I share my struggles. This demonstrates you're human. *Proof* is nuanced. It goes beyond testimonials. Prove you can help by demonstrating *how* you help. This delivers insight on how someone got a result. Don't just say "so-and-so got a result." Demonstrate the steps and insights. "These are the three ways someone got this result." This proves you can replicate it. These make excellent ads. *Problems* demonstrate competence. Share insights you gather. The more common the problem, the more unique your solution, the more traction you get. Give it all away. Don't hold back. Observe and offer solutions. This works on two fronts: people want you to solve their problem, and you build goodwill by helping. I have numerous examples of people reaching out after these posts saying they changed something and got a result. ## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Problems and Plan **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the problems and plan content buckets. Problems involve addressing common audience challenges and offering solutions, while plan demonstrates leadership by outlining a clear direction and vision. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I love seeing people do this. Delivering certainty in uncertain times is crucial

. I have numerous examples of people reaching out after these posts saying they changed something and got a result. ## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Problems and Plan **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the problems and plan content buckets. Problems involve addressing common audience challenges and offering solutions, while plan demonstrates leadership by outlining a clear direction and vision. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I love seeing people do this. Delivering certainty in uncertain times is crucial. The *plan* is the big daddy of content. It demonstrates leadership. To establish leadership, decide on a direction, define it, and lead others. The plan brings together all other content types. It's a demonstration of certainty. Plans require courage. They work as pillar content. I talked about my path back to $3 million a year. 10 months later, I hit it. It's a demonstration of competence and certainty. Having a plan is essential. "I'm going to do this with this many people." These are effective ways to grow an audience and be relevant. They require courage because you're exposing yourself. My client set a high profit goal. He's not hitting it, so he's writing about why and what he's doing differently. These have a soap opera element. People follow along. Taki had a plan to help 50 coaches to a million a year. It was a narrative he wove through his content. Plans can also take the form of sharing results. "7 things I learned to create a $73k MRR business." Share the insights. ## Building an Audience: Calls to Action and Content Reps **Summary:** James Kemp challenges the conventional wisdom of always including a call to action, suggesting that high-quality content often speaks for itself. He recommends starting with three content pieces per week and increasing frequency as you become more prolific. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Do you have to have a call to action? I have higher performance on posts *without* a CTA. Social media that constantly tells people to do stuff ceases to be social. If the content is good, you'll get a response. You don't need a CTA on every post. If something is time-based, a deadline, or limited spots, it's natural to point it out. What reps are required? Consistency. I write daily, so people think I'll make them do the same. If you can't do it consistently, don't do it. Start with three times a week and increase frequency when you become more prolific. Content reps build content reps. The way to write more is to write more. Establishing the skill makes it easier to deploy. There shouldn't be force in content creation. If you feel forced, narrow it down to be creative and consistent. Your results will vary. Establish a benchmark. ## Buying an Audience: The Daily Client Machine **Summary:** James Kemp discusses buying an audience through paid traffic, highlighting the potential pitfalls of generating low-intent leads. He introduces the Daily Client Machine as a solution for building an audience and converting leads into paying customers. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The third pillar is *buying*. All leads aren't created equal. You can build huge lists of unresponsive people. Paid traffic is powerful but dangerous. It can generate large volumes of low-intent leads. You build an audience, but not fans. The Daily Client Machine solves this. It builds an audience *and* partitions leads into customers. There are two components: the big idea and the customer offer. Run a simple funnel: ad to landing page to sales page. My ad: "Say goodbye to sales calls." My landing page:

> "Get the exact GDoc template that sold $802,000 of consulting without a sales call."
 80% of landing page results come from the headline. This converts at over 40%, leads are $2.50, and customer purchases pay for the ads. ## Buying an Audience: Leveraging the Daily Client Machine **Summary:** James Kemp explains how the Daily Client Machine can be used for organic growth and shares examples of its implementation, emphasizing the importance of the welcome email in setting expectations. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Get to the template, then the sales page with a customer offer. This is the most efficient way to grow an audience, leads, and convert to customers quickly. It solves the problem of thousands of leads and finding the few who will buy. Turn them into customers early. The Daily Client Machine can also grow organically. Mine go in my social media bios. I still get 20 sign-ups a day. Pay attention to the welcome email. It sets the scene and expectations, and how they can become a customer or client. These are the three ways. An audience is a long-term investment. Short-term actions create long-term results. Think long-term, but manage expectations. Returns are nonlinear. ## A Comprehensive Audience Building Plan **Summary:** James Kemp provides a practical plan for building both a large and high-quality audience, combining elements of borrowing, building, and buying. He emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective and managing expectations. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** People want instant clients from social media and ads. That's not how it works. Borrowing an audience is fastest for trust transfer, but lowest volume. A good plan: *Borrow*: Turn up twice a month to teach. *Build*: Post three times a week on primary and secondary platforms. *Buy*: Run the Daily Client Machine with a $50/day budget, two-step lead magnet, and $100 customer offer. This builds a large, high-quality audience, filters for ready buyers, creates trust transfer, and generates volume. The mixture is up to you. ## Reaching Out to Borrow an Audience **Summary:** James Kemp provides advice on how to approach someone to borrow their audience, suggesting a simple and effective script focused on offering value and demonstrating what's working now. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Everyone got the doc? Is there a script? No. 
> "I've got something cool. I'm doing this. Would it be useful if I shared it with your people?"

YT Five Steps To Positioning Your Brand in 2025 (Behind The Scenes) the world is in chaos Well they'd have you believe it So when things get chaotic and when things get crazy in the news and the marketplace and everyone's confused about what to do and then positioning yourself has never been more important and on this morning's call so my circle my inner circle people who have private access to me get together every Tuesday to jam on what they're working on etc And this morning I did something on positioning So positioning yourself in a market positioning yourself for now making yourself relevant making yourself attractive making yourself safe to buy so I spent 20 minutes taking the guys through exactly how to position the five steps of doing it how to think about the different components how what to consider what to discuss etc etc and then we went we jammed on it I want to share that first bit with you I think it's super relevant It's super helpful right now and I hope you get a ton of value from it I want to do a ditty on positioning as the it's time shall we say I think for in the next in the next while there's going to be tons of winners and losers and the it will come down to not so much what you're selling as how you're positioned in the and who you're selling to And that is I this I this bit because the positioning yourself correctly in a in the marketplace makes all the stuff you've already got better not just better in terms of its actual functionally better but it makes it more pointy in terms of the the stuff you do for people and also the stuff you the stuff you say out there So I the old all the copyrightiting formulas and AIA and all that stuff And there was one that works in copy but it works much better in positioning which is positioning in the market And the the major mistake that people have with positioning is they they look at their competitors and trying to position themselves relatively against what other people are doing And this is a this is the most common mistake if you because when things get uncertain people look for certainty So they start looking sideways and they go a so and so is doing that and they attribute things that they can see and they attribute status of the person who's doing them to what they should do next Right so they position themselves competition rather than position themselves against the the customer and the market conditions Okay I can hear myself back How come I can hear myself back ross is putting me through a voice I think I think I I have a There's five there's five pieces right and there's verify validate vantage values and the villain So verify is what people are seeing now or what they've seen in the past right and so when there's kind of chaos out there people get acutely aware of what where they are and how prepared they are for it So a ton of people who are retired right now and watching their their retirement accounts dwindle are feeling 
> "Oh All the all the investments I made in these things well maybe they were a mistake."

So they they see things and then the things that they see we validate their feelings right so when you verify you're seeing if I do the people that I talk to rising costs in ads you're seeing old models not working You're seeing unreliable stuff you're seeing or experiences with coaches So that you're seeing all these things the these things have happened to them right and this is what they see And it can either be the immediate things they're seeing or the things they've done in the past You validate how they feel So that makes you feel uncertain on what moves to make that makes you s uncertain on who to trust right and then you you present your vantage point This is what playing out I see solo one person businesses with low overheads and easy to buy offers as duh duh weathering the storm are going through this and then the values are the common things this is the where you introduce the Why why would I do that well I'm a father and a husband and I want my time and I want my to spend time on my health and my body and with my family and so therefore I'm building this business so I can look after my family Right this is this is the reason why I'm doing it These are all the these are all the logical reasons why these are the things you're seeing This is this is why you feel that with them This is the vantage point that I come from The best type of business is a solo offer driven business with multiple modalities deployed You've got one time offers You've got ways to acquire clients and you've got ways to ways to you're just introducing them to the idea And then the villain is complexity teams hiring costs gurus selling who are selling the the the old thing and you'll see some of the stuff in my content I'll be not calling out specific people but I'll be pointing out that there's people selling ideas that they know don't work in the market anymore right and so when you go through this when you go through this exercise with your content and the positioning then you go through a you go through a journey of taking someone through that you're displaying empathy that you understand what they're seeing you're acknowledging their feelings So you're being empathetic about that that that they are scared confused angry that these are the things they hate These are enemies And of course if you are hyper political you would you would position the enemy as a particular individual or a person you need to do these things so you can get over that over the man right and you could name the man if if if you had them And then the the the vantage point is that this is what I see So this is the this is the bit where you're introducing this is the way forward and this is the way that you need to go in times of high chaos You need to be the most certain person in the marketplace Right you need to present even if you don't possess it 100% confidence that the the methods the philosophy that the strategy that you're that you're presenting right now is the best thing for that person right and there's no room for may the more chaotic the overall environment in the marketplace the more uncertainty that's spinning around and there's just high levels of uncertainty spinning everywhere and there has been for quite some time Then the more certain you need to be about this is the way and the more you need to dismiss the other may and the potentials right so high chaos is is counterbalanced by high certainty And if you look at the the talking head marketplace or the marketplace of ideas or the social marketplace the people who are sometimes incomprehensibly confident about exactly what's going to happen are the ones that get followed along right the people who are this is happening to the economy and this is why tariffs are this and this is people are listening to them because they have that certainty of outcome right and so if we are leading people and selling them we need to have that level of certainty that almost irrational confidence that this is the way It needs to be

talking head marketplace or the marketplace of ideas or the social marketplace the people who are sometimes incomprehensibly confident about exactly what's going to happen are the ones that get followed along right the people who are this is happening to the economy and this is why tariffs are this and this is people are listening to them because they have that certainty of outcome right and so if we are leading people and selling them we need to have that level of certainty that almost irrational confidence that this is the way It needs to be underpinned by true belief and confidence But you you need to hold that that that that certain future as as the the the values piece is obviously people want to understand who you are and the that's the most I think that's the most imperceptible shift in the marketplace in the last couple of years that the the how has become commoditized and the who has been has been a lot stronger We we are much more subject to the influence of who is doing something than than how they're doing it because the the strategies that many of us do and teach and implement and those things are pretty commoditized everybody does them or different variations of them So the who is very important So you're positioning the values and the the easiest the easiest way to think about values is the common why You know what drives you what's important to you etc And then the the or the aspirational will attract the and then the villain And the villain is a stylistic thing I personally don't call people out right by name or by specifics And I don't even I don't even go very far when I'm using villains I will use conceptual villains in in any positioning I have bloated bloated teams and overheads and costs And I will use the villains as ideas Different people have different and sometimes very effective ways of deploying this but most everybody who has something that people are paying attention to will have some villain right something that resonates which is the the us and them thing that this raises because all of these positions just raise contrast that's what they do And so when when there's a clear this is us and this is them this is the villain you know and we're the good guys then it it it has a much stronger attraction component So positioning is fun in my mind because we can take a lot of stuff that already exists and just run it through the filter to ensure it's positioned against something to make it much more fundamentally strong Everybody has got something that's fun that's robust and fundamentally strong when people are put into it and put through it But the way that we get more people to see that i

.e the way we get more people to engage with us the way we get more people to engage with the ideas and and is contrasted against something And if you think about positioning in brand or positioning in content or positioning in copy they largely do the same thing where they're just having a high level of contrast but if you use those frames to go what are people seeing how are they feeling how do you present the vantage point what are the values and and then positioning it against the the alternatives then you're just going to be that the message will be that much stronger relative to the noise that's out there which is ever present and it's this isn't none of this is new but we go through these cycles and I I think the last major destabilization of what the is going to happen next was probably co and I think a lot of people are looking at the world now and being told that everything's changed and maybe it has and maybe it hasn't but ultimately if we position ourselves adequately then people will will look at our version of the future much more coherently Anyone need that notes or screenshot i'll drop it in there WhatsApp too Any questions about that any commentary super relevant How to Get Rich Fast, How to Get Rich Slow big rain overnight the pool has way too much water in it but rainy season is never ending so you want to get rich fast well this is how you do it so the absolute biggest opportunity for a high margin high profit fast business these days is selling expertise honestly it doesn't really matter how because you can offer services you can do stuff for people you can coach people you can mentor people you can consult on it but the absolute fastest way to get rich is by selling expertise and you get rich by packaging that up into a predefined solution that you sell for between $5 and $10,000 on a phone call and you do whatever you possibly can to get people on the telephone and then you make them an offer and you sell it and here's two really really dirty secrets about this it doesn't even have to be good to make money because if you want to get rich quick you don't care about the long term if you want to get rich quick and it's all about the money then you don't care about delivering results you don't care about reputation you don't really care about how happy your clients are and you don't really care how happy you are because to get rich really really fast the biggest secret is that you have to place the the ideal of getting rich over and above all feelings the only feeling that you have to cater for to get rich really fast is how someone feels about buying off you in that interim in that beginning point when you're making the offer and getting someone's money for you it's unethical it's inhuman and it's unsustainable right in all of those factors and the way to get rich is through helping other people get what they want and if you want to get really really rich really fast then you need to place your feelings to the side you you know this is what hustle culture is hustle culture is the ability to hustle no matter what no matter how you feel no matter how low you feel how depressed you feel no matter how sad you feel how tired you feel you've just got to go and get it done make the sale chase the person close the deal and what everybody goes through or goes into a period of time that I'm not embarrassed to say that I've been in that state many many times of it doesn't matter how I feel about this i'm just going to I'm just going to sell it I know this isn't the absolute best thing I can sell at this time and I'm and I'm still working out how to get results from it but I'm still going to sell it and I'll work it out and you know what i did work it out i did work out how to deliver results to everybody that I sell to and I did work out how to how to ultimately get out of the it doesn't matter how

." And sometimes that is true if the the goal is over and above your immediate your immediate feelings about it if you need money right now because you need to put food on the table I'd argue it doesn't really matter how you feel about what you need to do and that's where people dip into the the unethics and the and fraud and all these horrible things but the the way to get rich slowly in the way is do something for a really really long period of time and that means you become rich on all dimensions you become rich financially you become rich emotionally because you build resilience over long periods of time you become rich reputationally where people will come and seek you out where people will tell other people to seek you out where people trust you just because of your word and your name and that is how you also stay rich and I'm starting to expand the pure definition of rich because you probably clicked on this thinking about okay he's going to tell me how to make money and one dimension of being rich is definitely monetary true freedom is downstream of financial freedom but also people are really really happy for you to get rich if you do it with them people will resist you at every turn if you try and get rich from them and if you try and play zero sum games with money or status or reputation then they may seem to work for a while but they won't work long term so speed at different times matters and this is why the discernment of the individual useps everything else i have clients who we make a rational decision to to push and to hustle we make a rational decision to it doesn't really matter how you feel about this the next couple of weeks are just going to be a grind but you're going to bring in this much money and on the other side of this you built this asset on the other side of this this is delivered and you've got something established that then you can pull back from and sustain and I've got clients who are right up against the grindstone nose to the grindstone and they won't stop because they fear getting off the money train or they won't stop because they fear what people will think and we have to agree to pull them back and and take a dip take the dip take the take the going backwards take the slowing down for a period of time because we agree it's unsustainable to do this and if they don't then their big their risk is to go to zero and that's the way that you you know get poor and you get kicked out of the game is when you go to zero when you can't do it anymore when you can't sustain it etc etc which is all to say discerning on knowing what you truly need at the time defines how you solve the problem and how far you are prepared to push on that on all dimensions energetically and emotionally and financially and practically so you can get rich all the different ways that's I don't want to say it's never been easier but it's definitely never been simpler it's never been harder on so many dimensions mainly because there are so many options on what to do and who to listen to and that's some people just need to stop listening to everyone and just listen to one person and it doesn't really matter who it is because if they follow someone who's done it before and walk that path then they should follow them and ignore everybody else but it's never been simpler in terms of the opportunities and it's never been simpler in terms of the models The Fastest Way to $100k/mo Coaching Biz (And why I'm not doing it) I'm going to tell you what the absolute fastest way to make profit for the semi- average slightly above average person in 2025 is and I'm also going to tell you exactly why I'm not doing it as my Mr thine would say no cap for real for real and so to tell you what's the fastest I need to tell you that I've done it three times and three times starting almost a decade ago which was

.3 million us at the time then I did that again and then I did it again and the formula to this day works the formula of having a very high margin coaching training Consulting product that shows someone how to get a defined result over a defined time period that's sold for5 plus th000 via the telephone if you want the absolute fastest way to grow start and grow a profitable coaching Consulting business in 2025 the answer has been the same for about 8 years do that that is the fastest way because what you will do is have the highest margin product and as long as you f the product to the market you will have demand for it you as long as you can have a promise that people want they want to make money they want a better body a better relationship a better life whatever it may be there's only four categories I've covered them many times look out the videos make money save money live a better life or stay at a jail you got to be selling in one of those categories the absolute fastest way to sell that is on the telephone the absolute fastest way is to get people on the phone understand their current state understand the gap between the current state and their desired future State present your program as the desired future State and and then get their money and then put them in something that's high leverage to deliver you can get to multiple six figures a month doing that if you spend every waking hour hustling posting content to get people on the phone you get them on the phone and you sell 40% to 50% of those people into that product you'll make a ton of money you'll get some of those people results depending on your skill level how experienced you are how good you are the scope of the promise Etc that's the most variables that to this day is the absolute fastest way to do it the reason I'm not doing that is that it's a young man's game and what I realized after years and years of doing that the trade-offs that have to happen in the pursuit of growth and the pursuit of money are not trade-offs that I'm prepared to make so nowadays I have programs with defined promises I have a mentorship program that has no promises whatsoever it just allow people to look over my shoulder and share insights with them and and give them office hours a couple of times we where they can ask me questions it doesn't have a single promise in the world it's solded via a Google doc I will not get on a call I will only get on a call with people who invest in consulting or I've invested in them in terms of taking them as a coaching client and commitment or they're in The Syndicate and part of the mentorship and the reason that the call based system as a as a young man's game is requires a lot of energy and a lot of time and at my stage of life I have two children both of them over there right now I have two dogs both of them over there right now I have another child on the way I have a wonderful relationship I love to travel I love to do absolutely nothing for long periods of time I love to stuff around I'm wearing these clothes cuz I'm about to go on an hourong walk and listen to a podcast before our Chef arrives and cook and and Cooks us dinner tonight I don't want to be on the telephone all the time I want to spend time doing those things I want to spend time with the kids I want to spend time swing my pool I want to spend time chasing the dogs on the beach I want to spend time with my soon to be new wife and the the the young man's game is the fastest way to make money because you can deploy a lot of energy into it you can get people on the phone you can hustle you can grind you can do all those things and you make a ton of money and you might want to keep doing that or you might want to take it to the next level where you start hiring people you build a sales team to sell that you
