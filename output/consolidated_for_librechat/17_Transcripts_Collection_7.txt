# New Transcripts James - Part 10

. I'll just come up with a new tactic. And that is good for the good people and terrible for the terrible people because you, you can't, you can't innovate. You can't innovate and outrun it fast enough 'cause the economics don't make sense. 'cause the tension has just got so expensive. Yep. Yeah. I think this is a huge lesson for everyone on this call. No matter your niche, no matter your offer. What I've observed in our pocket, in the market that I'm seeing playing out everywhere is the era of better is over. And the era of different is here. When we got started a few years ago, there were king kings and queens of the hill. It was undisputed. It was Sam Ovens was the best at helping people get started. And for a lot of people, he was the best at helping get people get to a hundred KA month. And it was hilarious., who, who here has ever created a $5,800 offer, right, James? Okay. So there's a, there's a, there's a handful of people here. The reason I ask that is because that was what Sam priced up level, and that was the price point he told everyone to price at, to get to a hundred KA month. And so when I first started in, in my coaching journey in 2020, with my own official program, the number one most common thing I saw over the next 18 months was everyone charged $5,800. In other words, there was a, there was a, a perceived best system, a best way of doing it. It was you ran ads to A VSL, you had a closer, you, you were optimizing for these really specific KPIs. And then you sold a $5,800 offer that was broken into six weeks with lifetime access and a call a week. It was this undisputed, for a lot of people, that was the only way, what we're seeing now, what I'm feeling more than ever is people really focusing on the values and vibes of the people they work with., I caught two minutes of Sam Oven's school video update the other day where they were talking about, everything happening in school. And I found this so funny. They said, yeah, we've changed the way that school games runs 'cause we were attracting way too many hustle bros. And I was, that's so funny that they're talking about that as a software company not going, oh, these guys were, doing something bad. It was, oh, they're not the people for us. And I was, A software company is saying that, that they're, yeah, of all the people that we would want to attract into curator community, we are not looking for the hustle bros. The probably the underlying theme is, they can go over to Wop or GHL, but what we're trying to cultivate here is different. And the encouragement for everyone on this call is this idea that the idea of best and better do not exist. This idea of an objective king, queen category, winner, it doesn't exist in our market. And so the more we try and play that game, the more we are guaranteed to lose. And every one of our markets, there's someone who makes more than us, been in the game longer, has more accolades, more client success stories. And the more you try to play that game, you will always find someone who's willing to outwork you out, sacrifice you let, has, has less morals than you, has less integrity than you when you commit to the different game. Oh, I'm no longer trying to be better than James. I'm trying to be damn Bolton all of a sudden abundance. I'm no longer trying to run an ad that's better than someone else's

. And the more you try to play that game, you will always find someone who's willing to outwork you out, sacrifice you let, has, has less morals than you, has less integrity than you when you commit to the different game. Oh, I'm no longer trying to be better than James. I'm trying to be damn Bolton all of a sudden abundance. I'm no longer trying to run an ad that's better than someone else's. I'm no longer trying to run a workshop or write a book that's better than someone else's or is the best. I'm simply trying to be better at self-expression, letting my convictions be felt, my values, the vibe of who I am come through in everything I do. And this idea of a personal brand, it's, it's obviously not a new idea. I believe in it more than anything. The fact that I could shut my whole business down today and I could start a brand new business in a different niche with a different offer, different prices, different deliverables, and I would have my first a hundred customers in the first week is a powerful feeling because that's the power of a brand. I've been asked for marriage coaching, parenting coaching, which is hilarious 'cause I'm definitely not qualified for either. But that's what happens when you start to connect with people at a deep level, is they don't just see you as Dan, the business coach that helps people get to a hundred K month. They see you as Dan Bolton human who has these values, these convictions, and maybe a life that people want to emulate or a little bit of a taste of. And I just think I'm so, so passionate about this because I think everything's become so much more abundant. The the playing field has never been more level. There is no category king or category queen of our markets. It truly is, you could have a sales conversation with someone and they might be looking at someone's offer who's cheaper or is better, quote unquote. But they will choose to work with you because of the type of person that you are, because of the values that you hold and the way that you resonate with them at a deep level. And I, that just makes me so damn excited. And I don't know if it's always been as true today. I I don't know if it's always been as true as it is today. I think the world is moving more and more towards that. I, I, I think it is as, as we've lost trust in, in general, as we have lost trust in what we are told from the top down, then it's inevitable that people look for different sources of truth down to the individual unit, which is who is this person? Who are they really? And not, can I trust them to give money, but can I trust them with to care for me? Yeah. Right. Because we're in the, we're not in the business of scaling, businesses where if we scale care, then we scale the business, right? Yep. And we're not in the education business anymore. We're in the infotainment business. So we need a little bit of info and quite a bit of entertainment for the right person. Yep. And we're not in the community business anymore. We're in the culture business. what culture are you building, creating, facilitating, and those things. So they're, they're just, they're just the trends and the, and the spectrum that just moves along as people go through it. But fame has always been the most efficient business model. Yeah. It's just got a shitload of trade-offs around it that, that, that potentially need to be managed. Yeah, a hundred percent. Should we talk about ai? I know you've been doing some stuff with it. I've been going deep

. So they're, they're just, they're just the trends and the, and the spectrum that just moves along as people go through it. But fame has always been the most efficient business model. Yeah. It's just got a shitload of trade-offs around it that, that, that potentially need to be managed. Yeah, a hundred percent. Should we talk about ai? I know you've been doing some stuff with it. I've been going deep., it's, it's obviously a topic on everyone's minds., I'll just preface this by saying I see the market, our, our community. Let's just talk about the people in this room. I imagine a lot of people are split, they're either not doing anything with it or they're doing way too much., I talk to clients sometimes and they have a very clear bottleneck in their funnel, and they're, yeah man, I've just been spending last week creating an AI bot that replies to people's comments on my Facebook post. And I'm, brother in Christ, that is not worth doing., this is not a problem to solve. And so I think, it, finding how to leverage this in such a way that it's beneficial that it moves the needle is very, very challenging. I feel I'm finding more of a sweet spot. What have, what have you been working on ai and more specifically, how do you, how are you thinking about it now for businesses ours? I'm, I'm thinking of rather than, the conversation around the AI reminds me of the conversation, and I'm old enough to remember this about marketing automation. When marketing automation first came out, and believe it or not, it hasn't existed forever. When marketing automation first came out, people were, I'm gonna automate everything. And what people did was they automated s****y process. So there's this, I'm gonna automate all these emails, but they were s**t emails. I'm gonna automate this, this, this web flow. But it was a, it was a s****y flow. And so AI's the same, is that it's only as good as the things you feed it, right? And so people have tried to delegate work to AI rather than taking the time to understand what work needs to be created. So I'll give you, I'll give you an example about how, how I think about it. If someone starts working with me, the, the, the, the central pillar of what we need is a, is a good offer, right? And a good offer is only the one that's validated and responded to by the marketplace., their marketplace in general. That in that initial time, if we're starting from scratch, or even if we're doing something that will take seven to 14 days to get something, unless someone's a hyper action taker, something that is market ready and valid, validation. So there's a lag time between getting in the market and, and learning that is just filled with work labor. The most important thing is if the market responds to it. So you've got a minimum viable offer that you need to put in the market and get a response from. We know that if we have best, even with best practices, we need all these things to do it. And then the market responds. So how I think about it, if an AI tool can get that MVP in five minutes rather than 10 days, then we spend the, the, the time that we have saved learning about the offer in the marketplace where, where, where it matters, right? We can sit there and f*****g go through the Google Doc and pick out words and those things we don't really know until it hits the market. Mm-hmm. We don't really, really know much. We've got a good guess, but that, that's the best as we can do

. Mm-hmm. We don't really, really know much. We've got a good guess, but that, that's the best as we can do. Yeah. And so if we cut that time by using a tool, we get the labor of, we get the, the time back that we used to spend on labor and thinking about it and, and those things to get an MVP in the market. And we can steer the car that isn't parked anymore in the marketplace, which is why do people think it's too expensive? Why aren't they buying? Why don't they, why are they ghosting me and not understand it?, the important stuff that gets you feedback from the thing that matters, which is the marketplace. Yeah. So I see the AI tools as just as an extension of our main job in business coaching, if you, which is time compression. Yeah. What tasks can be compressed now that allow us to spend more time where it matters, spend more time in the marketplace, spend more time creating, spend more time with clients, spend more time, or whatever it is, because we can use a tool to compress the time, then we can have more time doing things that are important. Yeah. But it doesn't save us from the, the, it doesn't, it won't save us from the work in totality. We've got to, we've got to have the right inputs to get the right outputs. Yep. I agree. I think AI is not coming for all coaches. It's coming for bad coaches and AI assisted coaches are gonna crush. I believe I really gonna crush, or at least disrupt the market significantly for people who are still trying to do it all themselves. it's 2017. And it was funny when you talked about how automations, with a big rage. I remember when I stepped into Taki's world and people learned that they could do stuff with VAs and they're, yeah, I've figured out how to get my VA to create all my content. And then you look at their posts and you're, I can tell it's terrible. Don't do it. Right?, and AI feels similar. It's, I, I use AI for this and this and this, and I think for me, how I'm just very pragmatically using it for anyone who wants to get better with these tools is number one, I talk through challenges and opportunities with chat GBT all the time. And I, when I say talk through, I almost never type anything into a chat GBT prompt box ever. I click the little microphone thing and I rant at it. Sometimes it's two minutes. I have my record, I think is 18 minutes of just, just jamming on everything. And I got this from Ty Lopez. He, Ty Lopez said he walked chat GBT through everything to do with all of his businesses and all of his net worth, and said, give me a hundred different counterintuitive approaches to how I can reduce my taxes and, decrease my liabilities, increase my net worth. And he said it was life-changing for him. So I was, great, I'm never talking. I'm never typing ever again. I'm just talking. The second thing is, is that I'm really identifying the places we are. Delivery feels heavy for me, or marketing feels heavy for me. And I'm trying to figure out how can chat GPT help me with this? So to your point, James, you talked about how people struggle with offers. So I had the smart idea of in January, I, I, I glad I framed it as an experiment, but I said, Hey everyone, for January, I'm reviewing your VSLs and your offers. And again, this is the self abandonment theme coming through. Again, I'm just here to help everybody

. And I'm trying to figure out how can chat GPT help me with this? So to your point, James, you talked about how people struggle with offers. So I had the smart idea of in January, I, I, I glad I framed it as an experiment, but I said, Hey everyone, for January, I'm reviewing your VSLs and your offers. And again, this is the self abandonment theme coming through. Again, I'm just here to help everybody. And, man, I'm glad it was 30 days. 'cause I just repeated myself for 30 days because everyone's offers are more or less broken, unclear, muddy in the same places. Same with the VSLs. So I've spent the last two weeks building out a GPT called the messaging architect that can now review offers better than I can. And I know this because it rewrote my offer for me this morning, not from scratch., Hey, chat GPTI uploaded 270 pages of all of my emails from the last two years, and then I gave it my offer. And I said, right, let's imagine you are my ideal client. Let's work through this line by line. I want you to challenge me. Where is it vague? Where is it unclear? Where does it not, where do you not think it will resonate with my audience? So I've been doing that. The second thing is I'm building out a GPT to help clients build out curriculum. So this will both be pragmatic things, they do a call with a one-to-one client or a group call. This will then you add the transcription. This will then create a cheat sheet for that training. Or on the flip side, you have the idea you want to build out a module and then you can build out a ready to go document that will then, do that. The second thing is I've created something that knows my voice really, really, really well. And I'm helping it, have it helping, having it help me rewrite ideas and thinking I gave it a thousand pages of my content. So it's taken me about two weeks to put this together. And the stuff that it's coming up with is amazing because it's pulling from my brain, but stuff that I've forgotten, I've taught for dozens of hours on content. So when someone asks me a question today, I'm pulling from my most recent thoughts, but there's probably a whole lot of past thoughts that I'm neglecting. So I've uploaded transcriptions, I've uploaded two years worth of Facebook posts and emails. And so now it's my second brain., so I think for everyone on this call, the simplest next step is identify areas where delivery, marketing or sales, really anything in your business feels heavy. And then take those areas to chat GBT and rant at it and ask it for help. And if you simply do that, it will be smart enough to at least give you some place to start. The thing I personally wouldn't do is allow yourself to get lost in the weeds of AI and be researching AI tools that really have no effect on your business. Unless of course it's enjoyable. Do not mistake productive procrastination for momentum., don't go deep on AI tools and then wonder why you're not making any money. It's because you're not making offers. You're not creating content. You're simply sitting there trying to figure out a better AI clipping tool than the last one you had that was already good enough. So those are the big things that are on my mind with chat with AI and chatt PT Yeah. If you look at it as really task-based, what problem am I trying to solve and how do I compress that time, then it's super useful., for example, meta ads burn through creative, I've never seen in my whole life nowadays because the a the audience size is so big

. So those are the big things that are on my mind with chat with AI and chatt PT Yeah. If you look at it as really task-based, what problem am I trying to solve and how do I compress that time, then it's super useful., for example, meta ads burn through creative, I've never seen in my whole life nowadays because the a the audience size is so big. So I, I'm selling, a two hour workshop in my front, one in my front end products, right? So I dumped the whole thing into Opus Clip, which is a clipping software, and it gave me 50 shorts back, right? Yeah. And then I do no discernment. I just pick the top 10 and I put them into an ad. Yeah. And, and then I let the AI meta AI sort through it because it just dumps creative in there. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna take all 40 videos now and put them in the ads because it's just gonna run through the, the content. Yeah. So that's the, rather than coming up with 40 unique, pieces of content for an ad Yeah. The AI takes that, breaks it down and, and feeds it and I feed it, and then that cuts the, the launch time by days. Yeah. The other, the other thing that I've been thinking about in terms of, Wait, can we just speak to this for one, one quick moment? Mm-hmm. Because I messaged you about one of these ads the other day, and this ad showed up on my feed and it was one of the worst ads I'd seen because it's a video and the first five seconds of the ad James is just silent. He's just sitting there, it's on a call. And then he comes in with a thought. And I messaged him. I said, this is so I Bet it's working. Yeah. I said, this is so weird. I wouldn't be surprised if it's working. And he was, yeah, it's, that's, and, I just wanna, That's the stupid thing. I know. I just wanna speak to this. Really, It works so well Because this could be one of the best things that people get from this call. Last month I spent, I dunno if Logan's on the call and he can drop it in the chat, he runs my ads. I don't know how much I spent, it was not much, it was less than a hundred dollars a day in ads. And I got 14 clients in at, in my $350 a week offer. So I think my ROI was 30 or 40 x, which is really crazy. And this is my, this is, if anyone who's running ads, I want you to write this down. The best ads don't feel ads. And the best VSLs don't feel VSLs. So I had, I've got someone in my pipeline right now that looks he's gonna come on it as a $12,000 a month client. He's at 600,000 a month. He has 2 million followers on Instagram, a million on on TikTok. He watched my VSL and he was, number one, I loved that you had no script. It just felt so real, which is a hundred percent true. I just ranted for 18 minutes. The second thing was, is that he said it really spoke to him because it felt I was just sharing the experience that I'd been through. And so I think it's so important to think counterintuitively to how you think the, the thing should look right. We think an ad we psychologically go into, I'm writing an ad, I'm trying to be incredibly persuasive

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 9

convert them into prospects yeah so it's it's a bottleneck analysis as the :41 the first major hire if you because the virtual assistant is relatively easy to find you might go through two or three but the biggest thing I see :49 with virtual assistant is the Rel L inexpensive in the world that we're in and people are I don't have enough :54 work for them to do and you're you said the average virtual assistant :00 30 minutes an hour a day you're paying them to sit around for six or seven hours a day if they're full-time dedicated to you yeah but the relative :07 cost of that at 20 to 30 bucks a day is very very low yeah so at the :12 beginning people need to accept that someone sitting on the bench and they're under utilizing them but utilize them in :17 the future but your 30 minutes is worth more than their whole day yeah also delegation is a muscle you build it up :23 another skill everything's a skill oh man when I first got started with a virtual assistant I would be doing :28 things that the virtual citiz should be doing even when I had one because I kept forgetting that I could delegate it now :34 I got I I realized two platforms this morning had my old profile pictures I :39 didn't log in and change them it was a voice message hey can you change my School Community thing and my cly :46 profile photos to the Facebook one thanks now it's just a muscle so a really helpful framework that I :53 remember learning when I was hiring this and building this stupidly big team was from Ari misel and do AR's :00 story no so AR runs this I don't know what he does now but he used to run something called the replaceable founder :08 and his story was he built this business and then he got Crohn's disease and it got only work 1 hour a day so became efficiency productivity machine :15 when you're hiring let's say you figure out the bottleneck right so you look at appointment hitting you're spending too many times and too much :21 time in the DMS you go through this process called o a o optimize automate :28 Outsource right so the key is you optimize first you go is this thing that :34 I'm doing yeah is it important should it be getting done yeah is this :39 a later thing is this now thing all that stuff you filter it through is there a better way that I can be doing this to make it just as impactful :45 and less time all of that stuff automate oh this is a freaking super important question now in the age of AI :52 cuz now you're having things copyrighting and video editing and all those things where it previously it was :57 I need videos edited post a job now it's there is an AI for that that can take your podcast and edit it up and :04 then Outsource and the the point being your first response to overwork or :09 overwhelm should not be I'll go hire someone if you're going to hire someone it should be this refined focused super :16 Crystal Clear role your job is this this is how many hours they think it's going to be and I think the mistake that I've :23 made is right now I'm making more profit with a team of two than when I had a :28 team of 13 yeah and so the idea of you just keep adding people in and we'll figure it out on the way or hiring for :34 growth right is typically a stupid model when you figure out what the botnick is figure out is it a :41 botnick at all or you just going through a busy week then going through o a o o I think is really really key so right now :48 do you have any team at all what one yeah Alex VA right all round VA super :54 superstar cool right now I have a VA and a Content guy what's up sh up and :01 and I'm going

hiring for :34 growth right is typically a stupid model when you figure out what the botnick is figure out is it a :41 botnick at all or you just going through a busy week then going through o a o o I think is really really key so right now :48 do you have any team at all what one yeah Alex VA right all round VA super :54 superstar cool right now I have a VA and a Content guy what's up sh up and :01 and I'm going to be hiring more people soon because we working with an agency we're really scaling up content but the point is is that I wouldn't :07 even need Dylan to stay where I am if I want to stay where I am I could be right there with a VA as well but the point is is that there's the point is is :14 that there's no set team to get to 100K a month because it depends on your model depends on I don't run any ads :20 right now right so so it's also not should I run ads to get to 100K a month it's what's the bottleneck yeah :26 right and so I think team is much the same the only non-negotiable for me is get an assistant because you should not :32 be adding people on Facebook or responding to a support request or following up a billing a failed pay :37 payment those are all the things that are Nob brainers for me everything else is up for grabs I have no doubt I could :43 make more money today if I hired an appointment set and a closer I'm unwilling to do that because I have no :50 appetite for that that doesn't allow with my values I know that if I hired a full-time coach I could get more :57 clients that way because people love oneone coaching I'm just unwilling to do that so it's a question of values when :03 someone's scaling as well when it's less about the the five person team that is :09 the 100K a month blueprint and it's more about what are your values what are you trying to build how many hours what does :15 it look what are you unwilling to do what are you willing to do and then what are your constraints and then based on that high :20 the last thing I want to talk about as we wrap up is when you think about going from 10K a month to 100K a month what :28 are the biggest skill leaps and mindset shifts people need to experience in :34 order to go from six figures to seven figures the biggest skill leap is is :41 generally around offer making an articulation which is which is an the :46 the skill of empathy of putting themselves into the marketplace because at the moment they're selling something :51 that people but if they their market then they get right in there and and so the biggest :56 thing is the empathy the second the second piece of mindset can be largely solved by proximity if you're going :03 if you're going these days on a journey that you've never gone before and you're not in an environment with people who :09 have either done that Journey or on it with you then you're a fool because we can buy the we can buy the speed bumps :16 even free this we can buy ways over the speed bumps that that far :23 exceed the value of our the the outputs we get far exceed the value of the inputs so I think mindset is solved just :30 by proximity because it changes the belief profile because often when you're if you're sarting out from a from a a :37 leap from 10 to 100K you don't believe you can get to 100K right yeah :42 you just think you can and you haven't gone to I will yeah and when you :47 have the I will piece you can get that through going in a community and you walk around and you go to people you're :53 they're not any smarter than

because it changes the belief profile because often when you're if you're sarting out from a from a a :37 leap from 10 to 100K you don't believe you can get to 100K right yeah :42 you just think you can and you haven't gone to I will yeah and when you :47 have the I will piece you can get that through going in a community and you walk around and you go to people you're :53 they're not any smarter than me they're not even better than I am and then you getting in there and you're :58 okay the mindset shifts by being around people who are doing it and have a have a higher belief level than :05 you mindset doesn't change in isolation you you can't just wish your way to I'm going to do this I'm going to :13 do this I'm going to do this you can brute force it but you will exhaust yourself along the journey where if you :19 just get proximity then it changes your mindset because it changes your belief patterns yeah I find the only way to :24 really shift beliefs is to borrow bitter ones it's either education :29 environment or our relationships and so I I think the thing that we have :35 to say on this to anyone who's listening now to help them the most is you and I :41 wouldn't be where we are without mentorship courses being sponges we would say that because we sell that :46 stuff too yeah yeah but but I would I would say it to the extent of mentorship changed my life pre- business :52 when I think back to when I was 10 11 12 and wildly lost as as a guy in a :58 really crazy family it was the 18-year-old 19-year-old guys that :04 were helping me stay on the track and so I don't sell mentorship now cuz it makes money I sell it cuz I believe in it :10 right and you do too ex and I think there's something to be said about the fact that I think people should be :15 self-responsible they shouldn't be looking for Co coach as partners right meaning we're looking for :22 someone to become codependent with us and jump on the trenches and guarantee us results I think that's where we lose :27 our power that's where we get stuck and we get disappointed is because we're looking for someone to step in and say your problems are now my problems that's :33 not how it works but I think we also make a huge mistake where we think :38 we should be a lone wolf or we're or then we're signing up with a mentor but then we're filtering everything they say through us Reinventing and :45 innovating everything and I think there's just something to be said about following someone's advice and listening to it and doing it not blindly but but :54 without so many doubts and cynicism and skepticism the amount of people that are willing to pay for advice :59 they're not willing to take is wild it's it's crazy it's I see the same I see my :07 role as similar to I see my role with my kids yeah right my kids don't listen to :12 a single word I say but they model pretty much everything I do yeah so I'm :17 either going to be a role model or I'm G to be someone whose actions are completely disconnected from their words :23 and many parents are right they're get off your phone kids as they glued to the thing yeah and and I and I see the :29 same role that we have with both the people that we Mentor but also our mentors too that the proximity of those :37 things is modeled M and we learn much more by osmosis of modeling than we do by someone telling us what to :45 what to do yeah and candidly sitting around this table with us and being around us is a hell of a lot :51 better than them watching

[ __ ] but most of the time it's just purely through osmosis by by us being in proximity yeah yeah people didn't know :31 how close we were they would think that we're just two dudes just copying each other's things but what's :37 happening is we are sharing resources and sharing ideas so we're mentoring each other but most of it's unconscious :43 yeah 100% but but though in saying that the amount of times that we've had conversations where we challenged it I :49 remember coming to you end of last year or started this year and I was I'm going to let my team go blah blah feel serious blah you're I've been :54 waiting for this conversation and that's where I think people it's an interesting thing the last thing I'll :00 say on this is people should obviously lean into the level of access they can afford with the right people :06 there are people that Mentor me that I've never met that don't know I exist Brook Castillo right I would pay :11 for time with her though I probably couldn't afford it now she's probably bazillion dollars I have felt :16 mentored by her and she has shifted my thinking through her content yeah but people should pay for the level of :22 access that they can afford good because when you are in proximity with someone :28 there is something so much more powerful than being on the outskirts of you :33 know buying a course is not the same as having a coffee even though the course :39 might have more information than the coffee of a will proximity right we used to say in church culture with :44 leadership more is caught than taught yeah right so it's yes you can sit down and take the notes but sometimes :50 it's just in and around being in someone's environment in someone's proximity or someone's Community just paying for that level of access that you :56 can afford is one of the fastest shortcuts last thing I'm going to say on mind mindset and mind shifting is you :04 want to think about it hiring which is soul for the bottleneck yeah you don't need I don't need motivation :10 so I binged grant card own and ID my lead and Lewis house and all those guys when I was getting started because I need motivation I need the you :17 can do it I'm good man I feel amazing I feel fired up I feel full of vision so :23 I'm not binging personal development stuff these days and that's not to say I won't again yeah the season but it's :29 knowing what I need in the specific season and then thinking about it a medicine cabinet right not just going I :36 should be reading a book A Week why yeah what am I reading on what is this about so people becoming self-aware :42 enough to know what's the deficit is the deficit in my soul is it in my emotions and my character traits is it in my mindset or is it in my business :48 skills and solving for those skills through getting the right mentorship or exposure to education environments is :55 the real unlock to scaling really fast definitely yeah that was a real right there yeah I just want to thank you :01 so much for taking the time dude this is always a joy and we've been going for 2 hours and 10 minutes I think oh I'm :07 going to be L to Pilates I'm I'm about to wet my pants so I appreciate you brother I love you so much and I love :13 doing this journey with you oh that that was way too that was way wider than I thought it's it's the wide angle all :19 right thanks man thanks man Ex-$120M Director Now Makes More Money Working 2 Days a Week as a Consultant (James Kemp Interview) there are certain things that you can give and get that enrich your life in ways that you didn't appreciate a lot of people say they're building a business but what they want is enough cash flow to live

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 3

. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Understanding your core offering is crucial. Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing. ## Staying True to Your Core Message While Being Multidimensional **Summary:** This chunk acknowledges the multidimensional nature of individuals but emphasizes the importance of sticking to the core message when communicating with clients to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** You are multidimensional, but your business messaging should remain focused on your core offering. While clients can see your other facets, sticking to the core makes your message cut through the noise. Secondary benefits can enhance your offering, but the core problem you solve should be the central focus of your communication. ## The Two-Tier Client Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk prescribes a two-tier client offer structure (community and consulting/coaching) with specific pricing and client numbers to achieve an $83,000 monthly run rate. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A two-tier client offer structure can generate a million-dollar run rate. Tier two consists of 15 clients paying $600 per week, while tier one includes 50 clients paying $150 per week. This structure, combined with a $100-$150 entry-level customer offer, can generate over $83,000 in monthly recurring revenue, requiring only 1.25 new client sign-ups per week. Only 4% of customer offer buyers need to convert to clients to hit these numbers. ## Pricing Strategy: Maximizing Conversions and Economics **Summary:** This chunk discusses the tension between maximizing conversions and economics in pricing, recommending specific price points for community and consulting offers to optimize both. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Pricing should maximize both conversions and economics, which are often at odds. A recommended strategy is a $100-$200 weekly community offer with a $3,000 annual option, and consulting offers between $300 and $600. This pricing structure works across various markets. The $3,000 annual option provides higher upfront value and commitment, capturing more value than shorter-term, lower-priced options. ## The Hybrid Offer: Combining Community and Consulting **Summary:** This chunk introduces the concept of a hybrid offer, combining multiple products (community and consulting) into a single offer with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A hybrid offer combines multiple products within a single offer. For example, a $100 weekly community and a $450 weekly consulting product can be combined into one hybrid offer. This offer includes clear promises, outcomes, and timelines, unlike individual products, which primarily serve as containers for your services. This model allows clients to choose their level of access and speed of results. ## Selling the Hybrid Offer and Ongoing Commitment **Summary:** This chunk explains how the hybrid offer facilitates client acquisition by offering an ongoing commitment and allowing clients to choose their desired level of access and speed of results. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells an ongoing commitment, not fixed durations. Clients can choose higher levels of access (consulting or mentorship) while receiving everything in the base community tier. The key is a product that offers higher client value beyond the community level. This allows clients to control their access and the speed of their results, with greater access generally leading to faster results. ## The Nuance of Selling the Hybrid Offer and Maximizing Value **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of a clear plan within the offer, outlining the promise, plan, pricing, and ROI to maximize value and resonate with prospects.

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A compelling offer needs a clear promise, plan, and price. Can you articulate their desires and the outcomes of their commitment? Can you describe what they'll see? What negative downsides are you helping them avoid? What happens first, next, and after that? A clear picture of the next few days and weeks is crucial. Pricing should offer a clear ROI and be easy to get started with. ## Crafting Compelling Offers: Promise, Plan, and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk provides a framework for crafting compelling offers, emphasizing a clear promise, a detailed plan, and a justifiable price with a clear ROI, using a real-world example. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Effective offers have a clear promise, plan, and price. A strong promise outlines the specific outcome, installing a lead generation system that attracts five prospects and secures one high-value client monthly. The plan details the steps involved, developing a client roadmap and setting up a content system. This clarity allows for selling longer-term commitments (12 months) by focusing on initial, shorter-term commitments (6 weeks). ## Using Google Docs for Offer Creation and Iteration **Summary:** This chunk advocates for using Google Docs for offer creation due to its speed, ease of sharing, and modification, allowing for dynamic iteration based on market feedback. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Use Google Docs for offer creation. They're fast to create, share, and modify, allowing for dynamic iteration based on market feedback. The market writes the offer; iterate based on their feedback. This dynamic approach allows you to refine your offer until it resonates with your target audience and achieves the desired results. ## Clarity on Your Core Offering and Avoiding Messaging Confusion **Summary:** This chunk reiterates the importance of clarity on your core offering and avoiding muddled messaging, especially as your business grows and evolves. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Clarity about your core offering is paramount. It's easy to get sidetracked, but staying true to your core offering is essential for effective messaging and offer creation. Avoid muddying your message by trying to be everything to everyone. Focus on what you do best and let that clarity guide your decisions. ## Product Structure: Content, Community, and Customization **Summary:** This chunk outlines the three key components of product structure: content, community, and customization, and emphasizes the importance of a clear promise, plan, and price with a demonstrable ROI. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Products should include content (training videos), community (interaction platform), and customization (tailored access). Ensure your offer includes a promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI. If you can deliver on these elements, your offer is market-ready. Different levels of access within the product cater to varying client needs and budgets. ## Validating Your Offer and the Importance of Three Sales **Summary:** This chunk sets a validation milestone of three sales for new offers and explains how even a small network can provide valuable feedback for rapid iteration and improvement. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Aim for three sales to validate your offer. This milestone allows you to test your offer's viability and gather initial feedback. A smaller network allows for faster feedback and iteration, improving your offer more quickly through direct, real-world interaction. If 30% of people who see your offer buy it, you have something scalable

A smaller network allows for faster feedback and iteration, improving your offer more quickly through direct, real-world interaction. If 30% of people who see your offer buy it, you have something scalable. ## Auditing Your Audience and Leveraging Your Network for Validation **Summary:** This chunk advises auditing your existing audience, including past clients, email subscribers, and social media followers, and leveraging your network for offer validation and initial sales. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Audit your audience: past clients, email database, social media followers, advertising targets, and engaged users. Identify people you can talk to for direct sales and partners with access to your target customer. Leverage your network for validation. A simple message outlining the promise, timeframe, and easy entry point ($100) can initiate valuable conversations and generate initial sales. ## The Sovereign Sales Secret: Monetizing Delivery **Summary:** This chunk reveals the core sales strategy: monetizing the delivery of client services by selling access to client trainings and workshops to generate new customers and clients. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The sovereign sales secret is monetizing delivery. Create assets during client delivery and use them in offers. For example, host client workshops and sell tickets to generate new customers, then invite those customers to become clients. This creates a simple, efficient loop where product delivery fuels marketing and client acquisition. ## The Efficiency of Monetizing Client Delivery **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the efficiency of monetizing client delivery, creating a self-sustaining loop where serving existing clients generates new customers and clients. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Monetizing client delivery is highly efficient. By selling access to client trainings and workshops, you simultaneously serve existing clients, generate new customers, and build a valuable library of content. This creates a self-sustaining loop where product delivery fuels marketing and client acquisition, requiring minimal external marketing efforts. ## The Promotional Rhythm: Alternating Community Access and Workshop Tickets **Summary:** This chunk suggests a promotional rhythm of alternating between opening community access and selling tickets to workshops to maintain a consistent flow of leads and customers. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Alternate between opening community access one week and selling workshop tickets the next. This provides a long runway before needing structured lead generation. Most networks and audiences are underserved and under-monetized. With the right offers and rhythm, you can build a substantial business from a small, engaged audience. ## The Power of a Small, Engaged Audience **Summary:** This chunk highlights the power of a small, engaged audience and how a deliberate offer rhythm can generate high returns, using a personal example of alternating between workshop access and community openings. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Focus on a small, engaged audience. A solid brand, clear mechanisms, and a defined identity, combined with a deliberate offer rhythm, can generate significant returns. For example, selling workshop access one week and opening community access the next creates a consistent flow. This allows for building a large business with a small audience by being deliberate about offers and rhythm. ## The Sovereign Model: Slow, Sustainable Growth and Maximum Monetization **Summary:** This chunk contrasts the sovereign model of slow, sustainable growth with the boom-and-bust cycle of large launches, emphasizing maximum monetization through multiple access levels. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The sovereign model prioritizes slow, sustainable growth over large launches, which often lead to refunds and incomplete payments. This model maximizes monetization by offering multiple access levels: community, coaching/consulting, hourly access, and even bespoke services. This allows for consistent revenue growth and long-term client relationships

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Consulting hour packages are often sold organically through inquiries.

This straightforward approach can be highly effective. ## Q&A: Annual Pricing vs. Weekly Flexibility and Client Churn **Summary:** This Q&A exchange discusses the benefits of weekly pricing for flexibility and reducing client churn, allowing clients to choose their own adventure and easily adjust their commitment level. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Weekly pricing offers flexibility, allowing clients to adjust their commitment level and choose their own adventure. This can reduce churn, as clients can downgrade to a lower tier rather than leaving entirely. This flexibility also benefits the consultant, allowing for easier management of client fit and suitability. ## Q&A: Weekly Pricing Psychology and Ease of Entry **Summary:** This Q&A exchange explores the psychology behind weekly pricing, suggesting it makes longer-term commitments feel less daunting and easier to get started with. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Weekly pricing can make longer-term commitments feel less daunting, as clients can focus on shorter-term costs and evaluate their ROI before committing further.

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Operations consulting can be positioned as a make-more-money offer by focusing on the time saved and its potential ROI for business growth.

# New Transcripts James - Part 8

. Yeah. I think we, we have, we have slightly different philosophies in terms of maybe front end products and those strategic moves, right? And it's interesting to me of a hundred percent of the people who have joined me in, in in Q1, consume something. Yep. 90% consume something through the, through buying something and making the commitment an investment, whether it's $9 or a hundred dollars or $999, it didn't really matter. They got in, they consumed something, they got an insight, and then they took the next step, Right? Did other 10% consume something as well? They just did it over a really long time. they watched a lot of stuff. They wa they read a book, they watched a lot of videos, they stalked me across multiple platforms and consumed something, but they just did it in a much more, what we call organic way, Right? 'cause you're not just referring to just paid, but obviously it includes paid, It may, well in, in the cases of the 10%, it doesn't include paid, they didn't buy a single thing until they became a client. Right. But other people bought in some cases one or multiple products. But the theme is consumption. And I notice people getting really stuck on ads versus organic. Mm-hmm. And the commonality between both of them is that if you create a place in an environment where people can consume your ideas, then something, something will happen. Right? Right. Rather than worrying too much as our ads best are, again, 'cause we've got examples of both working. Right. Right. And, and this is where I think it's useful to go back to the, what is innately natural to you, right? If you can produce content every day that's super targeted, that's right on point. And, you can be super consistent with that over long periods of time, then pursuing an organic content route makes a lot of sense because you're just gonna produce it. People will consume it, and eventually someone will do something. Take the next step, reach out. Yeah. Become a cut. If you are, if you're not consistent with that, that you, that you run in sparks of inspiration that you, that you, beaver away for two weeks in a, in a room somewhere and you make a product and you're, and then you're really proud of it and you put it out there, then choosing a strategy that compliments that makes the most sense because both of them get consumption, right? Mm-hmm. And I notice a lot of people try and straddle these two worlds where they, they try and simplify it to organic ads, right? Do I do organic ads? And I think it's, it's more useful to how do, what can you be consistent at producing? And then what, how do, how do, how do how, what is the optimal way for people to consume that? And then the answer is at the end of that chain, because there's some very, very convincing people who are gonna tell you that organic is the best way to grow your business because they Yeah. This is so relative. what are you optimizing for? It's Extremely relative, but it's the, the consistency is where the, where the, where it comes out. I, I talked to a mutual friend yesterday and I was, how's the, the, the mastermind going? And he is, oh yeah, two people joined. One of them, has been following me for two years and the other one for three. And I talked about someone who came to Bali a while ago and who hadn't bought a single thing off me but started following me four years ago. Right? Right

. I, I talked to a mutual friend yesterday and I was, how's the, the, the mastermind going? And he is, oh yeah, two people joined. One of them, has been following me for two years and the other one for three. And I talked about someone who came to Bali a while ago and who hadn't bought a single thing off me but started following me four years ago. Right? Right. And it's, what can you be consistent at and how do you, how do you produce? We have to produce something to put out into the world, but how do you produce, I think, then dictates how you show up and what strategies you use rather than trying to be an imitation of somebody else., it'd be crazy to try and do daily email me if you haven't written every day for half your life, right. When people weren't reading it or weren't watching I was writing. And so by choosing and discerning what you are consistent at and what you can do for a long time, I think, I think forms the choices you make in terms of the strategy because then you then at the end of that, that's amplifying. Yeah. Yeah. I'll, I'll piggyback on that 'cause I think that's really connected to one of the biggest lessons that I've, I've, been thinking about and, and feeling. And you said something that's interesting and I want to challenge it, but you probably will agree as well, which you said, our philosophies on front end products are different, but my philosophy is this, if I did what you did, I'd make more money if I combine that with what I was doing. Right?, moving people to workshops, running workshops regularly, making office consistently, all that totally works. So, so, so philosophy wise, alignment. However, I would sooner want to punch myself in the face than write daily emails. Hmm. And so this is the key thing that I keep thinking about is, it is that true aspect of, everything works and we have to find the thing that feels, what's that saying? It's the thing that feels play to you but looks work to others. Yeah. So I feel that around video, right? I feel really, really light around content creation when I, if I'm allowed to create whatever I want to create, and it just so happens I want to create really often. But if I held myself to a standard, if I have a content calendar and today is, today is pain 0.371, why sales calls, suck., I would, I would quit this business because it feels the business would be telling me what to do. That sounds horrible. And I think there's this really deep sense of something more going on with models where we can talk about it on a surface level perspective of what works or what seems effective. And so, we'll take this for example. Everyone here should have a focus of having something that someone can consume before they get to your offer or your pitch or your sales conversation. You'll make more money the more of your stuff that people consume, right? That's, that's my core, belief around that. However, it has, the way you do it has to feel light to you. And I think, and I'll be interested to know what you think and have observed with this, James. I think there's this whole conversation around the nervous system that most of us are not having, which is that most of us choose models that, that we are choosing because it is the most effective way, right? This is the best funnel of 2025. The problem is, is that it leaves us feeling disregulated, misaligned, everything feels heavy. We feel we are constantly stuck in first gear, can't get momentum because that isn't how we're wired. That isn't what we are here to do

. The problem is, is that it leaves us feeling disregulated, misaligned, everything feels heavy. We feel we are constantly stuck in first gear, can't get momentum because that isn't how we're wired. That isn't what we are here to do. If you are a more creative type, there are so many business models that will absolutely crush you because it'll be, cool, just fill out your numbers 37 times a day and find out what the bottleneck is in the funnel. Where when people ask me what my numbers are, I'm, I have no idea. I get, I get a message from my VA once a week just giving me the summary of something and I barely even look at it. For me, it's much more intuitive. It's more about feeling, it's more about how much I'm enjoying the business. People will ask me, Hey, what you are doing this wait list thing?, is this more effective than this? And I'm, please don't copy me. 'cause I don't care how many clients I get, I'm just optimizing for fun. Talk to me about what you've observed with this, with your own journey coming into this year and the start of this year around this whole idea of, I'm putting words in your mouth, but nervous system, the thing below the thing where it's not this strategy works or this strategy works tuning into what feels best for you. Yeah. I, I make the most money when I'm have the most constraints and said another way I make the most money when I work the least, right? Because the, the non negotiables of I'm gonna turn up on calls three times a week are in, and everything else is, is is vibe in terms of optional. And so that, that the white space enhances the creativity. The creativity. If it's natural and innate and it's emerging, then it's fun. And the more fun it is, the more it's consumed and the more it's consumed, the more people are attracted to it. And the more people are attracted to it, the more people buy stuff. Yeah. Right. There's a question there. What if it feels light? But Maybe I saw that. I was, we gotta go after this Question. it's, i semantics matter a lot and discernment is, def is defining things for yourself and effective is not what James says or what Dan says. It's what is effective for you and what does the, the, the business should serve you. Right? And if it serves you, then it's effective. If it serves you, it probably serves others. And the internet allows us to find who the others are. And this is the, the inversion of the idea of that I, I think the assumption is effective means it makes money, Right? Whereas making money is a byproduct of value creation. And value creation as a byproduct of values and values are a byproduct of alignment of you being aligned with the thing that you're making and then the then this, then it comes at the end. Mm-hmm. Whereas the inversion that most people have is, I'm doing this because it makes money. And so the tightness is the only effective measure is money. Why do I hate it? Well, the the question answers itself because the only effective measure is money, but no value is being created because you don't value it. I'm just closing my window because the boys are just hopping on the trampoline., I think this is a huge lesson because I believe that the worst version of yourself that you can give anyone else is the one of you that's living under obligation. So I want you to really think about this from a pragmatic standpoint for everyone on this call. You follow James and you go, I'm gonna write a daily email because that's what he tells me to do

. I'm just closing my window because the boys are just hopping on the trampoline., I think this is a huge lesson because I believe that the worst version of yourself that you can give anyone else is the one of you that's living under obligation. So I want you to really think about this from a pragmatic standpoint for everyone on this call. You follow James and you go, I'm gonna write a daily email because that's what he tells me to do. And so, four days outta the week, you feel you've got some juice and some flow, and three days outta the week, you feel you're dragging yourself to your computer going, I need to keep this cadence going, or I'm gonna be poor. Right? Or you follow me and you go, I need to create a video sales or whatever else. The worst version of you that anyone's gonna get, clients, potential clients, your friends, your family, is one in that's, is living under the heavy weight of obligation. And so what you have to really understand is, is if you constantly serve the, the goal and the north star of, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to increase revenue, you have become money's b***h. Do you feel, Do you Feel, do you feel responsible I do for creating this though? What do you mean? 'cause we talk, we talk about, okay, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna project, I talk about making this much money per year, per month, per week and per day. And I am getting people to focus on how much money you can make in very short time periods. Right? Yeah. why? Because in marketing it f*****g works. Yeah. Because that's, that's, most people survive Me. I want that. Yeah. And the problem is it works. The problem is people respond to it. And so therefore they go, I, I want that. And then we go, okay, you can have that. And this is what you measure it on. Not how it feels. He's gone. I called him out so badly about being a marketer that he just left. No, I think the, the short term metrics, I I, I've oppressed myself under the weight of those for years and years., I wanna, I I I tell stories about, when I joined, Sam Ovens program and Andrew argued made the first a hundred K month, and I was, f*****g al imagine making a hundred thousand dollars a month. And so these metrics get very, these metrics get very short term where we start to think and look at the only thing that matters is how ma what happens on that particular day or week or month. So I, I'm back by the way, I have no idea what the hell just happened to my computer, but zoom just disappeared., I was the, I I said to everybody, it was 'cause I called you out about being a marketer and you just left in a half. I Didn't pay my wifi bill is the truth. It's too expensive over Here. You're broke. The truth is coming up. Sorry, I did miss the last part of the conversation. I heard you say you're not projecting and then we obviously talk about money a lot. IIII think we talk about, I think we talk about short term metrics a lot to the detriment of how someone's, how someone's feeling and existing in that, in that short, in the short term. Yeah. How does your business and how does, how do you are interacting with your clients and how does making this content feel today? Not what does the Stripe balance say? Correct. 'cause the perversity is, the more you optimize for that, the more the strike balance goes up. Yep. And the more you, the less you look at it, the more it goes up. Correct

. Yeah. How does your business and how does, how do you are interacting with your clients and how does making this content feel today? Not what does the Stripe balance say? Correct. 'cause the perversity is, the more you optimize for that, the more the strike balance goes up. Yep. And the more you, the less you look at it, the more it goes up. Correct. I have no idea how much money I've made the last few months. All I know is that I've made money. I don't track any of it. I also don't have stripe, which if I had stripe, I'd probably know. But I have some really ghetto, for people for, for, for bro scalers who got banned by Stripe., how I think about it, I don't know if this is the right way. I might become more enlightened in my older years and went, man, I was so off track with this. How I think about it personally is I I, my value around this is the Trojan horse, right? I talk about money 'cause that it seems to be where most people struggle. And I've developed a bit of a knack of how to make it. And if I can help people make it and get them out of survival, it allows me to talk about the things that are more important. Nothing's more fulfilling to me than helping someone make a lot of money for them to realize that money was never the thing that we're trying to look for anyway. So that's how I think about it, is that if I was to share what I really believe, and that's not to say that I'm being inauthentic, but if I was to really go out and be, guys, money's just not that important. Firstly, most people wouldn't listen. They'd be, cool, easy for you to say onto the next, you rich guy, person. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. But the second thing is, is that, I wanna meet people where they're at. And so there's this really big tension that I, I'm not saying I've nailed by any means, but how I think about it, if you think if, if you were to interview any one of my clients, I imagine it's similar in your world. People come in., the more I talk about this stuff publicly around not just money, intuition, the energetic, attractive piece of who you are. If people come into my world, there's obviously an emphasis on, let's fix your broken funnel. Let's, let's make your offer better. Let's help you make some money. But it much faster becomes around, what life do you wanna live? Who do you want to be? Let's let's move you closer to a calendar. You have romantic feelings towards because of our beautiful looks, and much much further away from just the money piece. So I think it's an interesting nuance and I definitely don't have the answer to it, but one of the things I will say is that I hope that both of us model a world in which we are happy to leave money on the table. And that money for neither of us is our true north star. That while neither of us wanna go back to being, broke minded and broke ba broke, broke bank accounts, I would absolutely take a much lower paying version of this business if I was able to still be the person I am now still feel the way that I feel, still have the level of freedom that I have in terms of my time., so there's nuances there, but I hope that we are at least doing our best to try and model. And I think for everyone here on this call, modeling is infinitely more important than, than what you say through content. The life you live is going to outspeak any words that ever leave your mouth

., so there's nuances there, but I hope that we are at least doing our best to try and model. And I think for everyone here on this call, modeling is infinitely more important than, than what you say through content. The life you live is going to outspeak any words that ever leave your mouth. And I think that awareness around leadership and market, why you and I are able to attract the people that we attract, I think it has so much more to do with who we are than what we say. Anyway, I'm, I could get off track on this, but I think, I think, I think that's a hundred percent true. And I think, there's a good question there because it's the, it is the, the the, the problem of the ages., how do you get out of the money scarcity mindset? And honestly the answer is, the answer is nuance. But it's, just figure out what it is you need to live on. the, I feel you can either have philosophical questions with someone who can't pay rent next week, or you can just figure out the fastest way to pay rent and then change the conversation. And now how do I do this in a lighter funnel way? I, Yeah. For me, for me, the answer's twofold For me. The, the, the pursuit of money was I had to mind the fear about what I was trying to run away from. And the pursuit of the, my pursuit of money was, was a was, and still is occasionally was through the, running away from the fear of abandonment because I felt that if I had money and I was, and I had a metric that showed I was useful to people, I was less likely to be abandoned. Right. And so the, the root, the root driver that caused me to do the work that I did and do the work to, to enable the skills to build the resources I've got now was me trying to run away from the potential of abandonment. Right. That I would be alone, that I would be unloved, that I would be, not good enough. Yeah. And so the, the money I saw as a shield mm hmm. And so I think most people have a pursuit of money to try to get away from something else. Yeah. And if what the something else is, then you can simultaneously rationally build wealth and money. Mm-hmm. Because it's quite useful and quite important and our society, but also deal with the underlying fear because fear is, is, our number one governor and the, the other, the other piece of that is vision, right? Money, human humans hate uncertainty. And so people who have a very vivid vision for the future, for the world that we are going to inhabit, that I'm gonna inhabit, that you are gonna inhabit people who have a vivid, clear vision of what the future looks, have attention and subsequently wealth flow to them when people buy into that vision. Yeah. And so the actions to the act, the, the simple actions to take today, not easy ones, mind the fear of what you, you what, what are you chasing and what are you, what are you running away from? Yeah. And that fear, what is the, what is your vision of the future that you are gonna step into and potentially invite other people along? 'cause that's what I see. I do. I just form a, an idea of a future that someone that I wanna live and, and, and, and trust that other people are gonna wanna live that too. Yeah. And then, and then, what, what, what financial needs do I have that I need to meet in terms of obligations and rationally take actions that meet those. you say, if you've gotta pay rent, go and get some f*****g money to pay the rent

and I've had people going to have pay me multiple six figures y so it's I I believe two Dimensions we're selling two dimensions of time yeah what gets done in terms of what did you say the goal yeah the the dream and the goal the Dream and the goal so sell the goal and then the dream yep and then two dimensions of this is everything that you get there's plenty there but if you want to go if you want to go faster go on the fast lane then then you can you can be here so so with so everyone listening to this has probably a binary belief they're either trying to Hash it out one offer to 1 million yeah we know that works right that can totally work right then there are other people who have value ladders and offer stacks and they go from a $7 thing to a $97 a month thing to blah blah blah blah again totally subjective there's no right way but how would you think about it when you're thinking about we've got this core offer that we're helping people build out right 90 days 16 weeks weekly pricing dream outcome it's goal not dream I love how I'm confusing people with the language it's dream but goal but it's the the short-term time commitment with a believable podcast yeah yeah when should people consider just totally opinion on integrating a second offer the second offer might be completely different so if we think about on practical ends it's a different Community different curriculum yeah and or just bolting on something to their original offer when I say that maybe it's a community offer and then you've got one to one connected to that I believe so this is this is this is a comes back to it depends on how fast you want to go I believe someone should develop a 12mon road map out of the gate even if they don't stick to that for the client with a definitive way of where you're going to take them in the first 12 to 16 weeks so I believe that people should develop a 12-month Roat for the client just to give themselves some certainty and have something to sell into and you know and if you already have a front end offer where you're just serving someone for 8 to 16 weeks one of the easiest offers to make after that is do you want to stick around and keep getting support yeah well why the road map is The Road Map important because because the biggest objection I hear from clients that can't figure out how to keep clients is they we've done everything you're then create more things to do and more problems to solve each problem you solve creates another problem to solve so what you're saying is identify more problems and solutions than just what you intend to solve in the first 16 weeks so that reselling becomes easy that's the first piece then what's the second piece to that that it's Dynamic mhm that it it's not I think people think that they have to have a 12 month road map that is fixed and at the the the early you are in the beginning the more variables that you have to introduce you go they can do that three-month period and three weeks right but this threat but based on experience the the three weeks I gave them to do that thing that's takes them three months cuz it's complicated right so the road maps a dynamic and and you need to set you need to have a Dynamic approach to to where the clients are going but it's again it's a hypothesis this is the best guess about what clients needs to do in the next 12 months to to achieve the dream and and then sticking to that and then being Dynamic within it to to change the order and sequence if you need to yeah we're always responsive to clients right yeah we talk about what you're making for your guys and I'm making for my guys all the time it's I feel in my Waters that they need a bit more jumping on a community call being so I saw James km say this and I'm mother no kidding but it's is so funny with

next 12 months to to achieve the dream and and then sticking to that and then being Dynamic within it to to change the order and sequence if you need to yeah we're always responsive to clients right yeah we talk about what you're making for your guys and I'm making for my guys all the time it's I feel in my Waters that they need a bit more jumping on a community call being so I saw James km say this and I'm mother no kidding but it's is so funny with business models and stuff that so so how I did it this year so this year was a reset for both of us we could do 10 podcasts about the hilarious journey of our our stories and you were selling software 5 minutes ago and not even doing consulting what I did is I did one: one first yeah and then I capped out a one to one and I'm a huge fan of telling people to at least start with something CU it is easy to sell yeah much easier when you say I'm giving you my time I'm holding your hand we're in the trenches together much EAS easier to sell than saying here's a course login all the best right it's it's easier to sell now especially when people have gone through courses and programs where they didn't get results for yes and the straight out we came out of the gate saying a similar thing which is you've done the courses you've done the programs and all you want is someone to help you assemble the good stuff yes so so what I did is it was one to one and then I filled that up and The Hybrid Offer then I was I can either just get more Ono one clients which was not appealing I could either just charge more which was appealing in the sense that I didn't want to move those 30 clients through a price increase and all that stuff and so all I did was create a community version of that and the community visual that if we just get it visual here okay so how you and I teach this right I think you call it the hybrid offer I don't have a name for it but there's one to one and the one to one that I sold was there's no curriculum so you're just getting my time there was no I think we had a slack Channel and then I built out the community and the community was half the price no one to one with me one call a week and a now a school group right so let's just say it's 1500 a month for community and 3,000 a month for one: one what's really beautiful about this particular stack is the one: one does not have a CPR group it does not have C curriculum it doesn't have separate group calls they have all the same group calls so we've got content coaching and community and this and then all that's happening is some people pay more for time with us crazy and this is what I is again it's so subjective so many ways to make money so many ways to get to 100K a month but I would say is the best way yeah yeah but but I would say what I would do is you fill your cup with onetoone clients you get insanely good at what you do controversial right I know you get you really good at what you do you charge a premium for it because you're selling a time and then you can bolt on a community you can do it either or but what I would say is if you start with a community you're not getting the rips in when it comes to Fig the the feedback loop is too long if if you got someone 10 people in a community it's harder to know how many people are winning and what they're struggling with if the only checkpoints you have is this person comes to a community call every 3 weeks right there's no oneto one chicken so I really starting one to one and going to group but here's what I would say that's where I would cap out to go to 100K a month is that you don't then

Fig the the feedback loop is too long if if you got someone 10 people in a community it's harder to know how many people are winning and what they're struggling with if the only checkpoints you have is this person comes to a community call every 3 weeks right there's no oneto one chicken so I really starting one to one and going to group but here's what I would say that's where I would cap out to go to 100K a month is that you don't then need this and then this and then another thing I think to get to 100K a month it's you could do it with one offer I think the sexiest way that I is it's one offer it's one content one Community it's just that some people get one to one and some people do not and the price reflects that this is the simplest model that I've seen to get to 100K a month i' I'd love to know what do you think of that model cuz I know we have very similar models and then there's one one other we need a third person in the room to argue against this there there isn't a lot of contrari and stuff I'm G to come up with here but but I would really love to know where do things oneoff things come in right so so let's just say people are bought in on this they're going to have one to one and they're going to have Community but I know in your world you have paid days people pay for days there are events that you run there are paid workshops so obviously youve got these core things how do you think about these auxiliary things these periphery things where they're not the main offers you've not spending all of your time promoting this one thing cuz we're going to talk about funnels and getting clients shortly and how to fill these but but how do you think about those things because I think one of the things that people really struggle with is holding the attention of I had a client today that just made me lose my mind where he was oh yeah I've decided I'm running a retreat in January so I'm just going to pause all promotion for my offer until then just to fill the event I'm so you are anyway so that's a tension that people find themselves in is they it's juggling balls and spinning plates and because these ones aren't going very well then I launch another one and the these ones are suffering and this one so how do you think about those things I try and make these distinctions as best I can without having an iPad and sketching them out so I I see there's two classes of people that that I transact with in my business there's customers and a customer will buy a training and a workshop with a defined a defined input and those are customer products and I sell those for between 100 and 500 bucks right so they're customers they have transacted with me they get a training they'll get a workshop it's to find them what they get then I have clients clients I dedicate energy I dedicate thought care Etc to and clients are there and they're making a commitment to come into my world and I'm making a commitment to them clients can enter my world in a community for as low as 300 bucks and then they can buy you there's another level of do you want to go faster do you want more access that's the next level up but I also sell ad hoc hours that you can buy in bunches of four and 10 mhm and then you can buy days with me or I I run a retreat every 3 to four months at the moment y so what I found is that in that client stack that it allows people to choose their own adventure because they're already pre-planning their time in their year I've got tons of people coming in January both in terms of to one off days with one: one but also a retreat at the end of January too and they're I'm getting there I'm coming over

mhm and then you can buy days with me or I I run a retreat every 3 to four months at the moment y so what I found is that in that client stack that it allows people to choose their own adventure because they're already pre-planning their time in their year I've got tons of people coming in January both in terms of to one off days with one: one but also a retreat at the end of January too and they're I'm getting there I'm coming over I'm going to plan the year Etc I'm using The Syndicate which is my community to keep going along and that's the Baseline so I've I've found that having multiple levels just allows people to choose their own adventure but it also maximizes LTV because sometimes people want a couple of hours with me to do a particular job and do that thing but they don't want to commit to one to one ongoing yeah and and I find it's it's offers the highest level of flexibility for me and the highest level of flexibility for them but the other distinction I want to make is a difference between offers and products because when I look at the client stack :00 I've Got The Syndicate and The Syndicate plus one one and then The Syndicate Plus :05 hours and The Syndicate plus Retreats or or VIP days then those are :11 individual products but I can also I have an offer that encompasses all and all I R all I really want to do is get :18 people into my world and then they can choose their own adventure as they go along yeah and that means that I have :23 onethird of people who join The Syndicate get something else within the first six weeks they either get hours or :29 they commit to a retreat or anything that yeah so there's a variable at play here that we need to talk about :34 it's the elephant in the room stress everything you just described :40 sounds hell or it's easy and it's amazing depending on this variable of :45 stress for someone yeah sure and so our business model is really unique :51 and we we'll talk about getting clients and team and things that short but I can't speak for you I have 0% :58 business stress my stress my stress exists with kids bro my 5 my :05 seven-year-old is waking up at in the morning I'm bro I'm losing my mind right so when I have I'm :11 running an event in LA in 6 weeks I have four guest spots the rest of clients :17 I've sold one of those guest spots already I'm confident those three will fill I also don't care I don't have :24 any stress associated with that so if I sent an email and I was I'm going to try and sell some hours I have no :30 attachment to whether or not those hours sell we have very high-profit businesses I have no stress I'm just having fun for :37 most people the challenge is when you have your core office I don't even know what I was using :42 before and they're not working very well and then you add :48 in all of these different things definitely now you've just spread your energy thin and you've increased your :54 stress and so I think that's a really important variable to think about is that until you are at a point where :59 energy is abundant where stress is minimized you should be doing the fewest things humanly possible 100% agree you :06 should be trying to get those things the phrase you used is when it's not working well yeah and the Instinct that people :12 have is when something is not working well is not to make it work well it's to add something else that doesn't work :18 well yeah now you've got two things that don't work well you don't have the you :23 don't understand why the other thing isn't working well so you add

[ __ ] I said said a line the other day I was :28 man I put this up on Twitter it wasn't that good but people were quoting it and I was we would rather :34 throw intensity at new things than throw consistency at old things yeah and I think this is just such an important thing to think about because :40 this is where the Nuance is right there is no right way and no amount of offers :46 that you can or can't have to make a lot of money but it's all predicated on you :51 as the business owner your passions the people you serve your capacity earlier this year the idea of even been :57 having this conversation and entertaining entertaining Live Events and things that would have been so far from my version of reality because I :05 was going through this phase of firing my team and trying to get profits back on track now when I'm sitting down :12 and I've got a community and I've got people who buy one to one and then last week I got my first $112,000 a month :17 client that variable with then there's no structure with that so that's what's even more interesting is there's no set :23 calls I'm just there to help launch a book right that would have been crushing because i' been in the midst of the :29 broken bus I've added in this whole other thing I need to think about and I've got someone texting me so now I've got slack and I've got messenger and :35 I've got someone texting me but now it's great I've got capacity and this is the big thing when people think about business model and offers is that :42 there's no one thing or right thing but there are principles that should guide us sure and stress I think is one of the :47 biggest variables that people need to be aware of you likely won't solve stress by selling more things yeah or hiring :54 this is controversial but the idea that you can just hire your way out of stress can sometimes work but if :00 things are already really bad unless the only stressful thing on your calendar is :06 the thing that that person is going to solve bringing more people into the chaos of your business will likely not make it feel bitter it will make it feel :12 worse yeah I that I that in terms of the selling things will it doesn't take the stress away it it :19 largely adds them yeah I the I go back to sequence and the sequence that you describe :25 before is I think people need to pick up on the fact that you and I aren't the right to :32 go through that sequence really quickly mhm in a pretty similar different timelines but not too dissimilar in :39 terms of what we've done and what we're doing in the amount of time we spending with each other is clearly something's rubbing we share we :45 share a fence guys we share a fence no that's that's that now the cat's out of the bag with that one the news is out we :50 started a cult but the the sequence of oneto one adding a community then you :57 adding higher ticket Mentor it's it's that's mentorship :02 that you're doing now in in the TR in the truest sense because it's unstructured it's how how would you think about that :10 Engagement some people are going to that sequence some people are going to take years to do that because they haven't :16 done all the Reps that you've done y but you can follow the sequence there cuz I followed a similar sequence I got 161 :23 to1 clients at 12 bucks a week yeah and I did that for 4 months and that's all I did and I was in safety because I was :31 making enough money and I was fine and I had Consulting revenue from other things on the side and I was :36 offloading some other things that were still making money but I was offloading those to reduce

that you've done y but you can follow the sequence there cuz I followed a similar sequence I got 161 :23 to1 clients at 12 bucks a week yeah and I did that for 4 months and that's all I did and I was in safety because I was :31 making enough money and I was fine and I had Consulting revenue from other things on the side and I was :36 offloading some other things that were still making money but I was offloading those to reduce the stress :42 because I knew on the other side of the 16 that then I'd add a community and then I made a slight tweak to the one to :48 one which I went from the the same model that you're running which is this is how many calls you get to to variable :54 calls on Demand right which is and that dropped the call volume by 40% which created more capacity but I still didn't :01 raise the number of one to one clients because I'm cool I can get capacity back time and energy to scale but all :07 along the way the hidden thing for me was I only do calls on Tuesday and Thursday so I don't feel stressed :14 whatsoever but because I put put constraints on what I was prepared to do :20 and unprepared to do in terms of feeding those things in so that also I think that helps in not getting caught up with :26 the the nonsense that people have of this is one to one is it scalable is it could questioning the :32 modality when really if you just do calls on Tuesday and Thursday I had an unusually heavy day yesterday did seven :38 calls right and it was that's okay what have I done today yeah come here :44 and talk to you and I went went to breath work and but it's the the sequence I think the thing that :51 people don't miss is that time Dimension that you can go through that sequence really quickly whereas someone listening :56 to this might need to do do that over 3 to four years Y and last note on this before we talk about funnel is sometimes :03 it's not even about logic it's about emotion in the positive sense right can we both double our business by doing :11 nothing else and just growing the things we have yes yes do we want to do other things because it sounds fun yes and so :18 did I need to add an in-person events for my community sell I don't think I did but it sounds fun I'm :24 in La next month running an event I'm in Japan in March running an event that sounds fun and so this is where it's :30 also not about need oh but do we need it's you can get to a point if you have high recurring Revenue High :36 profit low stress you don't have to be super strategic and everything have to be logical you can simply do stuff just :42 cuz you want to do it yeah I'll share this because it's been amusing for me I :49 I have not taken any PID PID and Fs this year really and I controversial I I I do :57 with partner offers CU 20K up front and it's a it's a chunk of work cuz I'm co-writing co-creating an offer with :03 someone but there is no pay plan because we just get straight into it and that's a particular type of type of partnership :09 but for my scalable coaching Consulting I've not taken a :16 painful every month I've increased Revenue by at least 14 to 20% my :23 recurring Revenue proportion is over 80% of monthly Revenue so I'm by all :28 and I'm and I made six figures profit this month M didn't quite make six figures last month but I will this month :34 and by every conceivable metric is going up but it's boring yeah isn't that isn't :41 that weird to say that I felt a couple of times of that grind up of just watching the everything just go up

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 11

I don't know what I'm talking about so I've got an idea and I know how these principles apply and I I work from principles but how does how does that layer over so yeah I always feel behind and I always feel feel a certain level of dissatisfied but then I check in with myself on the daily on a on a daily basis about what I'm doing who I'm doing it with and and why I'm doing it to ensure that I'm in the driver's seat of my life rather than than living someone else's life because I've convinced myself there are there are there are better things out there because there's lots of good ideas out there and there's lots of very very convincing people telling you that their idea is the best right and they've got we have all got very good at this myself included I have convinced if you many people that are a one person Consulting business is the panace and definitely the future and for for for many people that's correct and and and for some it's not yeah yeah I think your motto when I started with it I was this fixes every problem it's amazing and then you get a few months into it and you're okay there's some drawbacks yeah okay what's this but I I was just talking to my wife so can I ask can I Dials to tweak ask you a question about that yeah do what dials to tweak within within it now you've got it going well for me it's been a little weird because without trying the affiliate income has gone to a point where I never dreamed it would be yeah and it's just faster easier less effort the most leverage thing I could do and it's recurring and so I'm what does the I enjoy the oneon-one but also there's part of it that's just a grind for me and so I I'm also in Cruise mode where I'm can I just back up and but I'm what I took from you and I'm still taking is there's your Consulting model or your your agency model whatever it is is completely up to you so your thing about stop de or stop demonizing selling your time if you're selling your time for a th an hour that's a great effective rate just sell a 100 hours a year $100,000 if you have some saved you can have a a really amazing life with very few work hours and why would anyone do humanized that so that for me is I do enjoy oneon-one but I I was getting I think caught up in too much too many beginner conversations where I wasn't enjoying the monotony of it yeah and so I'm I'm recalibrating and figuring out how how much of the beginner conversations I want to be having versus the the higher level hey let's let's take this from 50k to 100K instead of let's take this from Zer to five sure yeah yeah one of the one of the ways I look at that and this may be useful to you is is is can I do I want to stop having these conversations or do I want to change the Forum that I have them in right so for me beginner conversations are much more useful in group environments where I can teach teach by demonstration through an example because the distribution of that idea is far more leverag because if there's 40 people on the call and they all take something away from me working with one person then the amplification of that is both more valuable to that individual but also the people who are there so therefore the amplification of that and the satisfaction that I get is much higher I'll have begning conversations all all day long but one of my clients who has 52 million a year I ain't dropping them in a group and saying what are your current problems and how are your 44 team members operating today and what are the numbers and are the kpis we do that via WhatsApp and and jump on a call when we need to because he needs me when he needs me and the availability of that is as is proof of

.1 million and you're that's cool solving problems at scale that didn't happen in a group call and a and a and a school group it happened on a on a phone call then a follow-up a follow-up Zoom where we're pushing things around and writing words so for me I'm always looking to change the the the modality and understand why I'm in that place where I'm I'm not enjoying something because the energy is not there yeah exactly and I think that's it's it's seeing the result for me that makes it worth it yeah and so that's oneoff calls I had a ton of those when I first started out was just oneoff call and then I never hear from the person again I was that was not worth the money that I got paid for that because I I need to know the outcome even if it's bad or whatever this person they just never report back and obviously you can you can reach out to them and usually get a report and I love those ones I I ran into somebody last week just at a local Meetup he's dude we did a Consulting call four years ago I was oh really was it any good and he was yeah I'm doing 30k a month now or whatever and I'm oh that's awesome I wish I I knew more of those stories and so for me I'm I'm I don't I don't want to be on all the time and have to be forced into calls at a specific time or responding within a a certain time frame so I'm trying to figure out is it just a season of the year where I do that because it's fine for a while or is it more taking equity in a few businesses and really being on the front row seat of what the Consulting that I'm doing is is changing for them but I'm luckily in a in a position where the i' again The Accidental affiliate income has has gotten to a point where I've it's opening up my abundance and mindset so much that I can take that time that you were talking about and just take the sabatical figure out what's next type of thing yeah yeah we we we learn through contrast right and what what your journey is helping is the value and the affiliate income which helps you define it and put it in a place where you define it and how much work and effort you want to do to grow it or maintain it or or whatever your decisions are yeah and then to to put yourself in places of contrast to say okay I'm coaching these two people oneon-one one-on-one is the consistent thing the the same modality the variable as the people this person enjoying working with this person I'm not they've both got the same thing but they're different people and I I was I was defining this on on a I have a Syndicate group who get calls with me twice a week around that these businesses are offer driven but human powerered I I can show someone how to make the best offer in the world from her it's easy to sell B but the the the L the the effect of that offer in terms of the delivery of it the stress the energy whatever it is and and subsequently the how long it's going to last selling easily and being fun to run Etc depends on the humans you put in it and in the knowledge economy that's pretty much defines almost everything if we make good offers people will buy them if we work with quote unquote bad people which is just a people who aren't optimal for us then those offers won't last and sustain and they won't give you the results you want and so many people will blame the offer rather than their their decisions in their commitments and their participation around it it's easy to get people to buy stuff but even if I called a 100 people today and offered them a thousand bucks on the phone you wouldn't have 100% close rate that's true and it reminds me and maybe this is just me realizing this in 2024 but I feel 2024 is the

won't last and sustain and they won't give you the results you want and so many people will blame the offer rather than their their decisions in their commitments and their participation around it it's easy to get people to buy stuff but even if I called a 100 people today and offered them a thousand bucks on the phone you wouldn't have 100% close rate that's true and it reminds me and maybe this is just me realizing this in 2024 but I feel 2024 is the lead of or the the year of the quality lead look I don't care about how many come through I care about how many have the money I don't have to arm wrestle into a sale I'm just I'm too old for this type of thing is what I'm hearing for most people even if they're not old and that that plays out on the other side obviously with how difficult they are to manage or how much ener they energy they drain Etc who who do you have to become to be the person or how do you attract the the Attracting Quality Leads quality leads and the quality customers even if you're a beginner there's two levels to this the first the first level of solving old problems new ways right and so the first the first level is old problems new ways just means there's certain things that aren't going away people will always want to look better naked businesses will always want more leads more sales More Money More Revenue more profit better team members Etc so all a lot of people are trying to solve new problems in new ways and no one understands what the heck they're talking about right right so look at old problems what problems that can be solved and what desires are in a Marketplace that you a category that you have permission to play in as in markets are built inside out I came from an e-commerce world and so my first clients were e-commerce because I could talk the talk walk the walk I could I could build inside out because I had market knowledge I knew participants I could speak the lingo and I knew what I was talking about so which which old problem can you solve in a new way in a category that you got permission to play in right and permission to play in might just be going into that category and and busting in the door and getting your first person to solve a problem for an end deploy Skill New Way means I've got a unique mechanism that sits over the top of the Sol problem and I'm solving it and that's how I'm going to get your interest right and so owning and branding your unique mechanism is really critical because it differentiates you in a in a commoditized market because lots of people are trying to solve those problems but when you combine those two things together you get a m a multiplication effect a Compound Effect that's much bigger than one plus one if you help people lose weight but you've got a new mechanism to do it combining the the the the old the old problem with the new way will get you far more attention a far more buying a far more application of those people because humans need humans have based desires but they also need stimulation and they need newness and they need certain levels of dopamine or something new in terms of doing it so they need new ways to to try and solve those problems the second level is is the way to get clients is by not needing clients the way to get money is by not needing it because you you're you're fulfilling your own needs first and you're in a place where you don't need anything from anybody and the closer you can get to that state the more that that will flow in because you've got capacity for it and in the world of Commerce the the the pushiest most aggressive sales people tend to make the most to tend to make the least sales because they project the mo the most need and need doesn't flow to where it's deserved it flows to where there's capacity for it so if someone feels that the only reason you're doing something is because you need the money they're unlikely

from anybody and the closer you can get to that state the more that that will flow in because you've got capacity for it and in the world of Commerce the the the pushiest most aggressive sales people tend to make the most to tend to make the least sales because they project the mo the most need and need doesn't flow to where it's deserved it flows to where there's capacity for it so if someone feels that the only reason you're doing something is because you need the money they're unlikely to give you that money but if someone feels you're doing this because you love it and you care about them and you and and that the result is the only thing that matters then the money is just the the transfer of that of that same energy and if you if you remove the need in yourself for validation through money through clients through being seen as the the the smartest bastard in the room then you'll find that that that power is accumulated indirectly by giving it away and allowing other people to have theirs and your power is is is the fact that you don't need any of it you don't need you don't need any particular person to make you feel whole and complete on that particular day yeah it's so true I was talking to a friend earlier today about how I I don't even see what I do as a business anymore there's no there's no ego wrapped up in it I'm not I'm an entrepreneur that chip on your shoulder you talked about I'm I just found some money glitch on the internet and it happens to be working out for me and that feels infinitely more powerful than having to parade around I know what I'm doing there's a beautiful gratitude wrapped up on that right that I was that that that idea that I was given this opportunity and that the that everything's working in my favor and here I am and it's meant to be and there's there's a beautiful gratitude in that which just says I'm the luckiest bugger on Earth because I get to I get to do this and this is happening for me yeah yeah it's so true so along those lines I feel a lot of beginners who we may have lost already at this point in the conversation but even a lot of advanced people all they talk about is revenue revenue revenue hey I can help you make more money yeah and going to that the quality lead Offer Creation conversation something I've learned from you is the the right people have specific problems that the wrong people don't have and specific desires that the the the wrong people don't have for example I was working with a client in the orthodontic space and he was saying how his orthodontist that he loved the most that was the most qualified and just closed the most people and had grown 2x since they started working together on his Facebook ads was he had gotten more efficient over his 30 years of being an orthodontist and therefore he was able to take on more patience and I was that's the perfect hook for an ad are you an experienced orthodontist with that has gotten more efficient over the years and you want to fill fill the spot so that you're getting as much leverage as possible for the days you're spending in the clinic let's lead into that but on your end I feel I I feel you've given me permission and others permission to be yeah I don't have to be thinking about business doing business having my ego wrapped up into my business 247 in fact it's better if I don't and arguably a more powerful desire for that right person the the orthodontist with 30 years of experience for example is here's how to spend more time with your family not here's how to make more money it reminds me of another hook I heard years ago that was don't sell the dentist Facebook ads ask the dentist you got to talk to the dentist about why the hell they became a dentist and talk to them about how to get out of that because they're probably miserable even though you may not be selling bizops to

desire for that right person the the orthodontist with 30 years of experience for example is here's how to spend more time with your family not here's how to make more money it reminds me of another hook I heard years ago that was don't sell the dentist Facebook ads ask the dentist you got to talk to the dentist about why the hell they became a dentist and talk to them about how to get out of that because they're probably miserable even though you may not be selling bizops to dentists you need there there's a lot of people that need a different approach or or need to be pitched in a different way does that make sense yeah so the thing I talk about is currencies right and so there's there's predominantly in an offer creation three pretty simple currencies one of them is the is almost infinite and two of them are measurable so there's just money in bizop and business coaching and even an agency World it's you are selling money right you give me $2,000 a month to run your Facebook ads and build your funnel and I'm going to give you $20,000 a month worth of business bag right it's just money Arbitrage you give me small amount I give you big amount is the is the is the promise then there's a Time factor which Le also leads the energy factor is that at a certain time people have a feeling of enough in terms of the money category and they feel they can move to a Time category that they want time back but what they're really doing is wanting energy back so my and I don't any of the language that we all use around low and high level and good and bad clients and people because I don't my my findings is none of those things really exist they're just perspective at a certain place at a certain time with with a particular individual but they're useful in the designation of this but high high level people want energy back more than anything right because we have a finite life and we understand we have a a certain amount of energy life force energy and we have a certain amount of time time to use it and we want to use it to the best of the abil of our abilities and then we have meaning around the things that we use our energy for ourselves our family and and these pieces so the selling of energy is you know to that to that orthodontist we just need to give them ways to measure it right ways to measure energy is you've been you've been in business for 20 years and it used to take you it used to take you five days to to serve 40 patent 40 patients in the chair and now you can do that in two and then it gives them and say and then you can spend the other three days playing golf with your family and and planning your retirement out and I'll help you plan your retirement out and an exit for your orthodontic business and and how to have enough cash flow for the for the rest of your life and so you can have intergenerational wealth that you pass down to your children and your grandchildren right and then they can start then they're starting to build a picture of okay I'm going to use my effort and that I've put in over the last 20 and that competence that I've built by being able to serve 40 patients in half the time into the things that matter to me and you paint a picture of that and that's what copy that's what copywriting does right it just allows us to paint a picture of the future that doesn't exist yet for someone and then allowing them to be Rel make it relevant to themselves so the the the low level the the surface level is is selling money the secondary level is is is selling time to some degree and the infinite game is is is is being in in the market to sell energy and then using the modalities that we have to to do that and in terms of service and delivery there's there's only really four and you just mix those modalities based on your Skool set

that doesn't exist yet for someone and then allowing them to be Rel make it relevant to themselves so the the the low level the the surface level is is selling money the secondary level is is is selling time to some degree and the infinite game is is is is being in in the market to sell energy and then using the modalities that we have to to do that and in terms of service and delivery there's there's only really four and you just mix those modalities based on your Skool set four modalities to sell energy you mean four modal to serve so we've got coaching Consulting mentorship and Service delivery right and Service delivery is just I'll do this thing for you and it it is nothing else I I'll do this thing for you I will spend $110,000 a month on Facebook ads for you to this funnel and this will happen you will have leads in your calendar and you call them on the telephone right yeah and it and it ends there we wrap a lot of stuff around it but service delivery is just doing something for somebody mentorship mentorship is this is how I would do it so my high level mentorship is people asking me how I think about things and how I've done things in the past that have got success that they want to replicate and I say this is how I do it this is how I think about it Consulting is telling people how to do something and then in the modern pance of consult Consulting is it's doing it with them so your traces of knowledge are left after you stop Consulting your system your ideas your philosophy is left there because you've done it with them and it's been embedded in the in the business got it and coaching has helped someone see that they've already got the things inside them to do the required action help someone see and give them Insight enough to get them to do the thing that they need to do that they're telling you that that we ultimately move them forward and we switch between those modalities naturally a lot of agencies do a ton of Consulting but they don't get paid for it and that's a gigantic opportunity for almost every agency to have a Consulting level in their business that just does Consulting and monetizes it because it's very high margin and high value work and business and so people are unconsciously do change between those modalities when they they're being a coach or even being an agency owner or being a consultant but those modalities when you understand the the what they are and how to deploy them that it opens up a world of opportunity about how you can use them either as individual products sell them as individual products but also serve people better in that time you've been on my on my group calls with folks and I and I ask permission to consult to them if I've got time and space I'll coach someone because that will leave the longest lasting Legacy because they they'll be able to do it themselves if we don't have time and they and they're floundering around as can I just consult you and tell you the answer and you going and do it and 99 times out of 100 they say yes right because they're looking to they're looking for the the life raft out of it but when you use these modalities you can serve people a lot better but in the process of that you serve yourself a lot better you serve yourself a lot better is that what you said yeah because Serving yourself you're because why why are you serving yourself better with those modalities because you're setting the correct expectations and life and a and a and a human world is about expectations and if you don't if you if you coach someone to do something but you're telling them what they want and what to do and you think you're coaching them but you're Consulting to them you're setting an expectation that this thing is going to be right for them rather than allowing to discover it themselves and that will Downstream have an effect on their application of that piece their their their results from it and ultimately their desire to continue it

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 15

it right and you don't need belief and Clarity to do it but you need some consequence to make you move otherwise you ain't doing it isn't that fascinating thing about the amount of convincing you need to start a business versus the amount of convincing you need to launch a new offer right people can convince themselves in a heartbeat to go I need to launch a new tripwire a new funnel whatever but to get over that hump of belief around I have something to to give of value is this huge insurmountable thing do you feel that's a skill set is is that a belief in and of itself what is that that enables you and us the further we get along to take faster action to to stop living in the place of overthinking yeah and in action what is that I think I think it's giving gratitude to the the changes you've made and not judging them I think something I do with clients quite a bit who have that belief that their stuff isn't good enough or they're going to not put an offer out there is go back and let them mind the past really look at the work they've done and the magic that you've created through an accumulated lived life you don't even need to be that old to have done stuff most of the people I work with tend to be older with kids and those things this is more accumulated experience but I think if you go back and mine what you've done and then you link the human story to the impact of that I I had a client a while ago who was it was property finding he's I just find people houses yeah but who lives in those houses what families are made what decisions are made and those things it's it's not in and if you link the outcomes of what you've done in the past to the human impact of things it makes it much more real than just a transaction of money because those things are fictional they're made up we made all the stuff up just to ease the wheels yeah well it is right yeah yeah but we but if we link the benefits and to the impact that we've had on other people we can start to display empathy and have a motion to say well I did something that was worth it I did something that was valuable right because everyone's got a legacy and if we learn to appreciate the Legacy we can turn a lot of those things into motivation to do things now to say well no if this only helps one person it's good enough I I write that yeah I speak to one person people go oh you're a good writer and it's because I'm writing to one person at a time and if it if it helps one person great if it helps a hundred even better and that's what one of the things I think that's really fascinating is the further I get along on this journey the simpler Everything feels in my brain yeah when you are running a Facebook ad you feel you were trying to you I I didn't understand the mechanics of what I was trying to do I was there is an algorithm and there is an ad and there are all of these masses of people that I'm trying to get on their screen and get them a click rather than going I'm trying to Target John who's probably sitting on the loop who's a human right yeah who has this distinct current situation this desired situation I'm just trying to motivate him a click I don't think I was thinking ever that personal it felt so complex and then now over time it's this is easy this is simple marketing is so simple right yeah but but it's something that you have to work through right you said earlier Simplicity comes through complexity yeah right oftentimes it we have to go through the complex and the hard to get to the simple and the easy yeah so when you launched right circling back you were coaching on e-commerce you're working with slick Sam ovens you're going through his course you said you did a million and 13 months you obviously didn't stay in that Niche although that business model without going through the

but but it's something that you have to work through right you said earlier Simplicity comes through complexity yeah right oftentimes it we have to go through the complex and the hard to get to the simple and the easy yeah so when you launched right circling back you were coaching on e-commerce you're working with slick Sam ovens you're going through his course you said you did a million and 13 months you obviously didn't stay in that Niche although that business model without going through the linear journey of every six months how did it change and what it looked you've evolved tons there has been so many different twists and turns you've you've had the good and the bad I have I'll never forget being a manly and the business that you had then was so radically different and so not a fit for you at that time compared to the business that why hiki James was crushing and cranking 18 months earlier and so when you think about going from e-commerce to the next Market to the next offer obviously there are metrics I don't so much want to focus on the an offer gets tired a funnel gets tired and so we launch something new but what is that Journey looked and felt for you in it was it a reflection of your personal growth was it that you were growing as a human being and all of a sudden the old business model didn't feel it fit what did that what did the evolution of the business models in the last six to eight years look and feel for you autistic no seriously I say it with a smile on my face but I'm a highly sensitive person and so my journey was mimicking the things I was paying attention to or the mentors of the people persons of esteem or authority that I was looking at at the time yeah and then I was just becoming derivatives of them right I'm a successful mimic which is again a challenging place because I was really good at mimicking because I could make it effective by just tweaking it enough to make it my own and then the feedback loop will be successful you can make a million dollars a year great but I topped out at two because I couldn't mimic my way through the next curve because I didn't want to because I was mimicking someone else's life and business model and even probably personality sometimes that wasn't mine right so I capped out because I I was playing a role that I needed to play and then the internet in terms of the the thing that I thought people saw of me of a brand then trapped me in it well I have to keep pretending I really want to do this because I've got people paying me money to play this character on the internet so hindsight it was just mimicry just really successful mimicry and there's a huge benefit to modeling but memory will always run you into the wall because mimicry gets you so close to the person's personality beliefs and those things that it's always going to challenge what you believe and who you really are it's such a subtle but important difference the idea of modeling versus mimicking yeah I was talking to Dylan who runs all of our content and I was dude the things that we're trying to do right now have already been done we don't have to get Innovative and creative and go we're pioneering something it's dude let's look at garyvee let's look at the people that have been way ahead of where we are and let's at least start modeling what they're doing what I'm not saying is let's take their top 10 thumbnails and go these are owls now right I'm just going how do they shoot what angles what does it look how what is that documenting versus creating process look but mimicking is interesting because I I would say I I have have had both past and prison massive dad issues right yeah so I think a lot of coaching for me was Finding guys that held some mentorship place in my life that I could then hook my horse to their carriage and go I'm gonna follow this person I'm going to become more this person

these are owls now right I'm just going how do they shoot what angles what does it look how what is that documenting versus creating process look but mimicking is interesting because I I would say I I have have had both past and prison massive dad issues right yeah so I think a lot of coaching for me was Finding guys that held some mentorship place in my life that I could then hook my horse to their carriage and go I'm gonna follow this person I'm going to become more this person and that served me really well in some instances where I'm I don't think I ever got the blue blazer in the in the New York apartment Sam but but there was that sense of I would listen to how Sam thought or talked and I would go oh I'm too expressive I need to be more thoughtful I need to be more structured he was he was churning out 13 hour days and then planning tomorrow today and doing all these different things and I would try them and it would be wearing someone else's clothes yeah and and yet there's so much value and modeling and so how do you think about it now having gone through the The Good the Bad and the Ugly because you and I still work with coaches and we learn from people I think these days I need to pay people less to get clean from them there are people I've never paid that I listen to their staff or there's a guy called Zane Lowe love is interviews he's in the music space he's mentoring me and away from afar but how do you think about that idea of modeling and mentorship now as opposed to the mimicking you were doing how what's a healthy version of that look for you now this comes back to the reality of my life and the consequences piece which is I'm a full-time dad and I don't have any time so I have to have constraints I have to design from constraints and when you are when you're mimicking you design From Desire or want to be that person or have the things that you perceive them to have I can no longer do that because I have to have constraints of it so I have to design from a place of I need to design my model based on the reality of what I see around me which is my kids and and the other things that are immediately important so it's been a force change that I have to do those things because time is scarce energy is scarce so I have to choose a model which works for me and there is no compromise on that because there's too many consequences of compromising and I think when you mimic there's much less social there's more social because people always find you out right yeah they always go you're just so and so you're just well the market the market doesn't reward you after a time because you're are you them or you this so you just it's it's not good business sense because you end up being everybody else in competition kills the prophets so I think about models now much more from a way of I have to do this and this way to preserve these things because the consequence consequence of me not doing attitude and I think one of the things I've learned is if you take advice the what or the how from someone with a different why you can end up building a business that becomes more a prison and less and less the how often do we see that oh dude this is what's fascinating is that most of the most popular entrepreneurial figures in our space who give the best the seemingly best business advice have completely different goals from the 99 watching them so when you're watching someone who is trying to get into the upper echelon of any human financially in all of history and you're trying to make 10 000 a month they might have great advice but it's coming from a different place and some of that advice is not for you because you have different goals yeah if you're already a millionaire versus a billionaire I don't think people understand the the complete different Stratosphere that lives in I think the stat is well

the 99 watching them so when you're watching someone who is trying to get into the upper echelon of any human financially in all of history and you're trying to make 10 000 a month they might have great advice but it's coming from a different place and some of that advice is not for you because you have different goals yeah if you're already a millionaire versus a billionaire I don't think people understand the the complete different Stratosphere that lives in I think the stat is well not the stat but the number is a million seconds is 11 days ago a billion seconds is 32 years ago right so when people are taking advice from someone who's trying to have a thousand million dollars it's such a different why it's such a different drive when we mimic someone that we might experience some level of progress and and even your business might grow but then you have a business that you want to run away from more than you're excited to run because it doesn't align with your values and I think one of the things that's been really helpful for me and I feel I've been picking mentors and and models so much better in this last season is because I've been connecting with people with whys much more yeah yeah so does this person share my values do they share my Outlook and Life to their share my worldview I'm not looking for 100 agreement I'm looking for alignment yeah right I'm looking for a sense of if you give me advice I know it's coming from a place that you understand I'm a parent or you understand I'm married or you understand I want to stay married or all of those things and so how have you gone about picking people to learn from because I think that's a challenge whether you've got a credit card in hand and you're going to sign up to a program or whether you are choosing to dedicate an hour of your your day listening to people how do you think about the who do I learn from who do I give time to who do I model from it's it's all about the relative constraints again there are I know a lot lots of really smart mainly young dudes right you're one of them I don't know lots of them you're a little bit different to the 25 year old Twitter Bros who are really smart yeah really smart and they're doing the right things and the fundamentals are there but their life is different to mine it's different to yours right so it's do these people understand the map's fine but the terrain is very different right so do people understand the terrain you're sitting on in your on your real life because everything works every business model that you and I come into contact with can be made to work in some cases they shouldn't you shouldn't want them to work but everything works but the the the map and the terrain are different things so for me it's where is this person coming from and it is it does come back to those core principles now and principles values and and increasingly these days track record Because the Internet is distorted so much of what we see is true and false it's okay and we've linked also to financial success and performance with some level of higher morality right oh yeah well I'm going to listen to them because they're rich right it's that's very binary and a way to do it so I think I think to answer the the question it's about nuances saying what's the circumstance of those people where's it coming from what's the overall goal and vision of that and how do you how do you do that how do you do that in a way that's applicable to me and and then living there I ran a workshop the other day and it was I started with all the principles I started with how I think about things and where I come from and some very complicated thanks it wasn't hyper tactical and I'm Unapologetic about that they're I want to teach you the principles so you don't need me right I don't want trauma bonds and codependency with clients right

how do you do that how do you do that in a way that's applicable to me and and then living there I ran a workshop the other day and it was I started with all the principles I started with how I think about things and where I come from and some very complicated thanks it wasn't hyper tactical and I'm Unapologetic about that they're I want to teach you the principles so you don't need me right I don't want trauma bonds and codependency with clients right if you want to be I got enough of my own I don't need any more of them so so I come from a place of I I don't want you to need me and that I think in terms of paying attention to people who are doing it that way and then paying attention to how I'm doing it and if those things sync up then I'm generally on the right track what and I think it's the reason why we haven't recorded these conversations I think the primary reason is we know that it would slightly distort and dilute some of the things we say and some of the angles we have yeah because there's a performative element in all human nature yeah I'm trying to I'm struggling to get comfortable in this chair I'm I'm normally raising you directly we tumble ideas around and we we know each other's lives very very well in terms of the bigger picture I you won't even hear when I arrived I'm sitting in there chatting to live in the and the boys and those things and checking out the chickens yeah those relationships are they're Priceless and valuable to me because it's I know you yeah I know the I know the business Dan I your posts on Facebook and watch your videos sometimes yeah on double speed yeah there we go but who's the person yeah what are they doing what's their values what do they believe and we're going to change along the way because stuff happens that you never you never see coming well I think this is the interesting piece around this the space that we play in right online coaching Consulting marketing this Creator economy whatever we want to call it we've seen it drastically evolve right you could have a funnel yeah and that was it maybe you would have a few posts on your Facebook page so someone clicked on your ad you didn't look a ghost but we were taught a model that worked really well which was you run an ad to a stranger they click on a landing page the landing page is a big promise you you enter your details you come through the video there's a rags to riches story there's a problem there's a solution there's an invite to a call one in 20 people book the call and then one in five people close yeah right and that can still work to a degree but one of the things that I'm seeing is the era of the personal brand is is upon us it is we're we're content is now a filtering mechanism to go is this my person because in 2016 if you're a consultant struggling with your clients you were desperate for Solutions and there were very few around right Sam Evans pops up in your feeding goes how to get 42 clients in 69 days or whatever it might be I can't remember his hook and it was it was new it was fresh I didn't do how we're going to get clients automated now there are so many people who say the exact same things as us and we think if we just outspend them in ads if we just out funnel them out follow up then we're going to win but the reality is is that people are looking for depth with us I think now because they realize it's it wasn't business to business business to Consumer it's human to human and now that there is ample competition and there's red ocean right it's about now that that saying I heard Kevin Kelly say recently it's don't be the best be the only the model if you always just be the best right it was just how do you make the biggest claim how do you run the best

going to win but the reality is is that people are looking for depth with us I think now because they realize it's it wasn't business to business business to Consumer it's human to human and now that there is ample competition and there's red ocean right it's about now that that saying I heard Kevin Kelly say recently it's don't be the best be the only the model if you always just be the best right it was just how do you make the biggest claim how do you run the best ads and now it's how do you create a connection that no one else can replicate because it's you connecting with someone else yeah and I was talking to a client yesterday and he he sits up really quiet he said the best decision I've made in the last year of my business was hiring you but I hired you different to every other coach you've ever worked with every other coach I worked with was I had a problem and they had a solution I asked myself before I hired you do I want to become more Dan and because I answered yes I've worked with you and it's been amazing because you're taking more more in the direction of the person I want to become not just the I'm a square Pig and that's a square hole and and so I think that's a really fascinating Nuance to this whole conversation because I think there are a lot of creators and consultants and coaches stuck in the old model that if I can just out Market if I can do a launch or a five-day challenge without creating real deep intimacy with the audience they get stuck they can't outspend the fact that the people just don't trust them the way they used to what do you think people should be thinking about whether it's doing a podcast whether it's writing posts on Facebook how do you think about cultivating that sense of a personal brand now as opposed to you you're one funnel away yeah I think something that I've got clients do recently doing is writing intention documents for themselves to to a piece of self-discovery that gets down to what they really want and what is enough and not being shamed around that an industry where everything's seven figures this and seven figures that people coming back with six-figure goals that they internally shame themselves for that despite that being profoundly impactful on them and and have constraints around it right yeah and then in many cases they've shared those intention documents With Their audience people want to know who you're becoming right they want to know where you're going because the true north only now is the person behind it and we've understood that this filter of the Internet is just as as can apply a filter that people can say and and do anything at the time but unless they're unless you're very clear about who you're becoming and who you're following then that same mimic and sensitivity that that I fell victim to in a successful Financial way is going to come to fruition because they they've followed they've already got experience following people that they didn't want to become doing things that they didn't want to do and they were attracted by The Glitz and now they want to know who are you where do you think you're going and I'm okay with you reserving the right to change your mind as long as these basic principles and these these values are are still consistent yeah because that's all people want they just want consistency with those things yeah they don't want the rug pulled from under them say oh it was all a scam and it was all morally ambiguous and they don't really have those values that's why we that's why we look at when people get caught doing things that are underhanded who have a a high moral standing in society we have that look yeah because if you undermine certain values then you can never be trusted again it's funny because again it comes back to that idea of we give people credibility where they haven't earned it based on status yeah this is funny in crypto right it's people were surprised that crypto rug pulls happen yeah and it's you trusted this person because
