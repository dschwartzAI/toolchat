# New Transcripts James - Part 3

. Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: I think people don't know what at well means. You can turn on when you need. James Kemp: It's a hymn right Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: And then that would be the description of that Jarred Brown: The mechanism. James Kemp: That would be the description of the what the alteration Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah, which is, step 4 in the offer, Doc, for the summit. Chronic thing James Kemp: Yeah, some good suggestions in the chat they're, activate or or step into, or too long Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: And then we lay out the phases Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: That Jarred Brown: Yep. Jarred Brown: Yeah, that's fine. James Kemp: That with people really go far enough. Right? James Kemp: I'd I've used. I've used this analogy before. What people want in transformation is that scene from the matrix when they plug the spike through the back of Neo's head and upload his black belt, Karate. James Kemp: and as Judo, and as gunfighting, and all that, whatever. I can't the movies so long ago. But that's what people want to be reprogrammed. They don't want to do the work. James Kemp: Even people who doing the work, don't want to do the work. They just want it to be plugged in Jarred Brown: Yeah, sweet. I can tie all this up just the investment part. James Kemp: Yeah. Jarred Brown: So maybe just have a bit of a a hand with with that James Kemp: So it's 3 k. For the year Jarred Brown: Yeah, I've gone up to., I've gone. I went up to 3,300 James Kemp: Okay, what's the pay plan? Jarred Brown: Pay plans 9 on a week if they do weekly, which is, ends up being 5, 1, or something that. 5, 2 James Kemp: Okay, so. Jarred Brown: So that's 4, 99. Now, something that. 3, 99. Now James Kemp: Yeah. Could you do 500 now? Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: Then 500. James Kemp: When your alter ego is installed. James Kemp: I'll let you finance the initial, or 500 James Kemp: over 4 weeks at 1 50 a week Jarred Brown: Yeah, and then James Kemp: They're just approximate, right? And then Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: They want to stay. James Kemp: You credit the you credit. You can credit the whole thing Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: Against that, but you could also raise raise the price. So you still capture the same amount Jarred Brown: Yeah, so they didn't. They didn't. A $1,000 off the the summit for the year or credited a thousand dollars. What's the conversation? What's the conversation ? Jarred Brown: Are you in the back of your mind, knowing when the offer install? People are coming to an end and, what are you? Jarred Brown: What's your framing and positioning when they're coming to the end of these things, particularly to 4 weeks, is a pretty condensed period of time, what's your what's your positioning that you're taking with them as they come into the end of the 4 weeks James Kemp: I'm not. I'm I'm probably not the best example, because I'm not proactive on those things. I just let it James Kemp: unfold. James Kemp: Do you want to stay cool. What are you doing Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: Right cause it

. I'm I'm probably not the best example, because I'm not proactive on those things. I just let it James Kemp: unfold. James Kemp: Do you want to stay cool. What are you doing Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: Right cause it. And in the levels that I sell this into, it's not coaching. James Kemp: It's it's focused on getting the result. And if they want to stay, they stay, and if they don't, they don't James Kemp: bye Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: This is a coached offer. So the the when you are having the conversation is when they James Kemp: get the 1st breakthrough. James Kemp: Oh, they come back after a week, and they're that conversation we had last week changed everything after, and the weekend was completely different. James Kemp: Right? James Kemp: They get the 1st breakthrough, and you can Jarred Brown: Cheers. James Kemp: Then apply it, then Jarred Brown: Yup! James Kemp: Or they're coming to the end. And you're just asking them how the experience has been, and you'd love them to stay because they. They know now they know what the summary James Kemp: truth, because they're in it. Jarred Brown: True. James Kemp: And then it's Jarred Brown: It's easier because there's more context James Kemp: It's this. Jarred Brown: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Great. Awesome. Jarred Brown: Cool up with that. Are you just able to? Oh, there we go. Done it for me. Jarred Brown: Oh, that's what I was gonna ask, could you link this on? how you were saying the other day around your new office cycle? How you're doing shorter timeframes, even just offering something over the top of the day. Jarred Brown: Is this a really good one where it's you might I might open the summit for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Close it, and then go and then boom straight into. I'm opening one spot up Jarred Brown: to this, is this, are those . Jarred Brown: yeah, what's your thinking around the whole rhythm cycle? Now, in in conjunction with Jarred Brown: your sovereign circle centered here, and then these offering stalls James Kemp: That was the answer to the question, is baked into the the delivery piece. James Kemp: It's all about what capacity I have. Right. James Kemp: So people. People are coming to Valley next week, so I'll wipe out Tuesdays for calls. So that means I've only got Thursdays. What capacity do I have? So what offer am I opening Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: But from a market perspective, you're not necessarily Jarred Brown: Fatiguing the market. Did how you were saying the contrast between a Jarred Brown:, you might do a customer offer? And then the following week you have A, and you're contrasting between price. Could you easily could you easily promote this the day after James Kemp: I'm going on way higher cadence than I'm going on a way higher cadence than that now. James Kemp: because fundamentally, I'm I'm making 2 to 4 distinct offers. A week Jarred Brown: Cool. James Kemp: But I'm also making those offers in different places. So James Kemp: 50% of the time I've opened the offer installed this year, it wasn't even to the list in public. It wasn't even to the community. It was people who had missed out on the 1st few ones. Right? James Kemp: So I'm running multiple multiple tracks of demand

. A week Jarred Brown: Cool. James Kemp: But I'm also making those offers in different places. So James Kemp: 50% of the time I've opened the offer installed this year, it wasn't even to the list in public. It wasn't even to the community. It was people who had missed out on the 1st few ones. Right? James Kemp: So I'm running multiple multiple tracks of demand. James Kemp: So I'm I'm making one offer James Kemp: publicly, if you, to the list and social, I'm making another offer James Kemp: in the community our hours, or an upgrade to the syndicate, or something that. And then I'm making yet another offer to a group of people who responded to the last offers, but missed out. James Kemp: So the cadence that I'm moving out I'm of James Kemp: 2 active offers at any time, and then publicly, I'm moving through James Kemp: 2 or 3 offers a week. James Kemp: cause there's always something coming up right Jarred Brown: Sounds rhythm. 2 point O is on the horizon. James Kemp: But it's it's kind. James Kemp: It's a lot my thinking around content. And the idea of a calendar, right. James Kemp: that you're going to make a particular offer James Kemp: in the future. And it's going to do this thing James Kemp: doesn't necessarily reflect what is happening in that future. James Kemp: because if I've got a full calendar of calls. And then I'm going, hey? I'm gonna fill up my calendar even more with calls. James Kemp: because I said I was going to, and I planned to do it, that as counterproductive. James Kemp: it's not productive. It's counterproductive, right? Because James Kemp: there is only so much capacity James Kemp: at the upper, at the upper levels of our access and attention. James Kemp: And so the rhythm for me, it's not based on James Kemp: what I said I'm going to do James Kemp: is what capacity I have coming up Jarred Brown: Yeah, makes sense. Jarred Brown: And the cool thing about these little offering stores, or from my case is 4 weeks is Jarred Brown: you might have a really great client result and Boom feel really inspired to talk about it and then make it straight in office, look at your calendar. It's empty for next week and make an office straight away on on one of these little offering stalls James Kemp: Yeah, the I made a video yesterday about how to go fast, how to go slow. James Kemp: And I've seen I see this a lot. James Kemp: I often give people something that's worked for the 1st time ever James Kemp: I give them an offer that's they've never had something that got a response rate the . The offer that we do together. James Kemp: So what they do is they make it, and then they thrash the shit out of it. James Kemp: For a few weeks James Kemp: they extract all the demand from their audience, and then they do it one last time, the 3rd or the 4th time, and nothing happens. James Kemp: and they've pulled all the demand out of their available audience. James Kemp: and then they demoralize themselves and they go. James Kemp: Oh, but that people aren't buying. Yeah, but you've just signed 18 people Jarred Brown: And James Kemp: Calendar is absolutely groaning with stuff. And James Kemp: and they're, yeah. But people aren't responding. I'm James Kemp: managing the ebbs and flows of these things is what keeps people in the game, and what do they do? They stop and they go

. James Kemp: Oh, but that people aren't buying. Yeah, but you've just signed 18 people Jarred Brown: And James Kemp: Calendar is absolutely groaning with stuff. And James Kemp: and they're, yeah. But people aren't responding. I'm James Kemp: managing the ebbs and flows of these things is what keeps people in the game, and what do they do? They stop and they go. It's the offer. James Kemp: No, it's it's the relative demand that was available to you at the time. With this offer. James Kemp: Right? James Kemp: And then they go. Hey! This install offer or this 8 weeks offer, and then they do another 8 week offer, and then they fill up the capacity again the rinse, all that demand out of it. James Kemp: And then, 2 months later, they've grown. James Kemp: but they don't know what to do next. James Kemp: because they they've got poor retention off the back of it, because most of the people left, etc. Because they. James Kemp: if you if you prioritize short term response rates on everything. James Kemp: you will just live in this 48 to 72 h anxiety cycle about what's going to happen, and how many people are buying in that time? James Kemp: Right? James Kemp: But if you forecast James Kemp: how much capacity you want to have, and how much you want to supply, and how many people you want to work with and who they are. James Kemp: Then what you find is that you can just deploy the different offers. You've got James Kemp: to just keep that filled up to the brim at about 80 or 90% Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Jarred Brown: Yep, James Kemp: And if you don't give a fuck about James Kemp: how you feel about any of it, and you want to make the most amount of money. You just James Kemp: expand the calendar, work more hours, fill it up even more, etc, etc. And then James Kemp: just just wait for the burnout. James Kemp: It will just come later because you're a bit tougher than other people. Jarred Brown: Yeah, no, that's cool. It's it is. It does come back to your principles, your workflow, your calendar, and how many people you went on board, and Jarred Brown: this is really cool, because it does show me the skill in unbundling, bundling offer creation packaging whilst keeping the model the same . Jarred Brown: It is very, very yeah, it's very cool. So thanks for sharing, because Jarred Brown: you're now integrating the models not changing, but the way in which your packaging offers come into the model. So it's giving me more creative ways to see how to bundle and unbundle and package things up James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: The the aim for me is to give you the toolkit, but you have to use a sermon about how you deploy it. James Kemp: I've been in this. I've been doing this for a decade, and I can continue to do this for another decade, because I have the capacity to do 19 calls in a week to an extremely high level, but I also also have the capacity to do absolutely nothing in a week, when I don't want to James Kemp: right, and my ability to do both of those extremes keeps me in the game. James Kemp: because I'm perfectly okay with doing absolutely nothing for long periods of time, and just sitting on my ass and waiting for the waiting for it to strike again

. James Kemp: because I'm perfectly okay with doing absolutely nothing for long periods of time, and just sitting on my ass and waiting for the waiting for it to strike again. James Kemp: Right? James Kemp: But I'm also perfectly okay with pushing a motherfucker and working harder and at a at a higher level than most people. James Kemp: So I can manage both extremes, because for a lot of people nothing happening is more torturous than James Kemp: everything happening all at once. James Kemp: And so my ability to sit in both places James Kemp: allows me to keep in the game, and the long term outcome is balanced right? It's just balanced through exchange. James Kemp: And so Jarred Brown: Love it James Kemp: Understanding what capacity we have at any one time James Kemp: is the discernment we need to go. Where's the toolkit going to go Jarred Brown: Yeah, how? What am I gonna use in it? Jarred Brown: I'll I'll tidy up some words and make an offer on it today before. So that's cool James Kemp: See you later. James Kemp: Hey, Caroline? Caroline Carpenter: Hey? There! Caroline Carpenter: So so I oh, I'm sorry. What James Kemp: No zoom just did a zoom thing Caroline Carpenter: Did a weird thing. Sorry. I took my hand down, and then it switched me. So Caroline Carpenter: I want to check my thinking on this offer install. Caroline Carpenter: It might not be well, I know it's gonna be simpler than my brain is making it. Caroline Carpenter: and I've got my launch coming up. Caroline Carpenter: and I'm going to put this in front of a few women first, st and I'm wondering if my timing is way off as far as the weeks that I've delegated out. If if speed is the thing. Caroline Carpenter: the goal is Caroline Carpenter: so I'm in the position of I want to help women get to 10 K. Monthly recurring revenue in 10 h per week, 25 clients or less. That's my goal I'm assuming there's well, that's several other women's goals, too. If I'm going to paint the vision for them. So I've had months higher than that. But it was not monthly recurring. Caroline Carpenter: so I'm going to avoid having imposter syndrome right now. But this offer is installation of the soulful CEO blueprint. Caroline Carpenter: Where most women go wrong is, they keep applying all of their focus and energy in all the wrong places. Caroline Carpenter: and it just goes to crap. Caroline Carpenter: So I've got 3 phases. It's more of a how do I frame up the bigger container while making it look a quick, moving offer that will get a result because I don't. I cannot ethically promise money in the beginning, because it Caroline Carpenter: the women I end up working with it doesn't? Well, one did it in 4 weeks, but that was high intensity, one on one, and I'm removing myself from that. I've already made someone mad with that. But anyway, my capacity. So Caroline Carpenter: I'm unsure how to properly position this ethically James Kemp: Need to position the the whole thing Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: No James Kemp: the direction . I don't position the syndicate at all in any of this, that I just put them in it, and then they James Kemp: they make up their own mind Caroline Carpenter: So I don't even need to say, here's phase 2 and 3. Do I even throw money in there, or say, this is the goal, because it's not a promise immediately. I think I'm James Kemp: What what is, what is available

. I don't position the syndicate at all in any of this, that I just put them in it, and then they James Kemp: they make up their own mind Caroline Carpenter: So I don't even need to say, here's phase 2 and 3. Do I even throw money in there, or say, this is the goal, because it's not a promise immediately. I think I'm James Kemp: What what is, what is available. James Kemp: And so it's audience that you're speaking to to me. James Kemp: Awesome. James Kemp: Excuse me for me. James Kemp: A solution. Awareness of an offer James Kemp: is the only is the only thing I need to work with right. James Kemp: I also have people in the audience a solution awareness of I need a James Kemp: I need a funnel which gives me 10 leads a day, or whatever, all of those could be install offers for me. So what what is present in the audience on a on a solution basis Caroline Carpenter: Women with a skill set that are making money the way they've been told they've been making it and doing everything they don't want to, and it's a simple restructuring of their offers Caroline Carpenter: right now, from our perspective James Kemp: Okay, so what what puts them in motion? Caroline Carpenter: You mean as in prior James Kemp: If they could wave a magic wand James Kemp: to make next week better than this week what would show up Caroline Carpenter: Oh. Caroline Carpenter: this would be where the one move comes in to stop doing the things they don't want to do James Kemp: Which are what. Caroline Carpenter: Overworking, being scattered, going not need to nothing, getting nowhere, going to burnout James Kemp: How James Kemp: ? Where are they spending their time? On? What things are they gonna stop doing, and what things are they? What one thing Caroline Carpenter: That's wrong. James Kemp: Jumping from thing to thing to thing, overthinking how they're gonna get to, where they're going Caroline Carpenter: Sticking to one thing is very hard for them. James Kemp: Yeah, why? Caroline Carpenter: Oh, they're doing everything they've been told to do versus what they want to do. Caroline Carpenter: So running business is the way they've been told to do that. It's completely out of alignment with how they operate Caroline Carpenter: connected to themselves. Caroline Carpenter: Yeah. James Kemp: So what do they want to show up Caroline Carpenter: Where do they want to show up James Kemp: What do they want to? What do they want to see happen for them? To James Kemp: have the feeling that this is going in the right direction Caroline Carpenter: Oh. Caroline Carpenter: well, this is where the sense of relief comes in. I'm not sure I'm clear enough on that yet. I'm still working James Kemp: Wow! Caroline Carpenter: Hmm! Caroline Carpenter: Clients that they would to spend the day off with James Kemp: How many. Caroline Carpenter: That's a great question. Caroline Carpenter: Depends on if they're close proximity or far proximity, and James Kemp: It always depends Caroline Carpenter: Right right? Caroline Carpenter: Probably a few, a few close proximity 3, I would say, and 10 ish Caroline Carpenter: with distance between them. James Kemp: So for for most people. James Kemp: The one is enough. Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Caroline Carpenter: One. Okay, so, your next. James Kemp: They've never. They've never experienced Caroline Carpenter: Yeah, I, James Kemp: They've never experienced a. They've experienced a high quality client, but they came and went right Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Yes. Caroline Carpenter: Yes

# New Transcripts James - Part 4

. James Kemp: So for for most people. James Kemp: The one is enough. Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Caroline Carpenter: One. Okay, so, your next. James Kemp: They've never. They've never experienced Caroline Carpenter: Yeah, I, James Kemp: They've never experienced a. They've experienced a high quality client, but they came and went right Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Yes. Caroline Carpenter: Yes. James Kemp: They've experienced a James Kemp: someone that they want to work with forever. But they can't. They came and went. They don't know how to talk to them again. They don't know. They don't know what they said last time to get that person to work with them, and they don't know James Kemp: how to do it again. They don't know how to replicate a result Caroline Carpenter: Hmm, James Kemp: And so when you, when you talk to certainty. James Kemp: that transference of certainty gives some James Kemp: relief immediately, which is the comfort of the future. Caroline Carpenter: I do have one example that May. Caroline Carpenter: it's going to make crystal clear what you just said. Caroline Carpenter: One of my close proximity clients. Caroline Carpenter: After I had heard this one mechanism, said for the 1st time, I had a referral Caroline Carpenter: that asked me if I had capacity to do what she was asking. Caroline Carpenter: and she was paying me well, and that was huge for her James Kemp: Yeah. Caroline Carpenter: So I don't know how that would translate in something to point at or tangibles. Caroline Carpenter: But the client that James Kemp: It's not, it's not their next client. It's their next soulmate, client. James Kemp: It's been that's cool. James Kemp: IP, client. Caroline Carpenter: So I'm wondering if my verb is just completely off. Then, with a soulful CEO blueprint James Kemp: No! Why would it be off Caroline Carpenter: Well, that would need to be installed first, st I'm wondering where to position. I love that next soulmate client. Caroline Carpenter: How quickly would I position that, or is this where I Caroline Carpenter: just talk about it? Don't put it in the offer. James Kemp: So the the install offer can be James Kemp: Your next soulmate, client, just one, right Caroline Carpenter: And then you have the James Kemp: Tools and the offer, and the positioning and the messaging to attract as many of those as you want. Right James Kemp: So I the frame of building someone an asset. What they do with that asset is up to them. James Kemp: They probably want my help, cultivating that asset, building more assets, etc. But if they don't. James Kemp: that's fine. James Kemp: Going to deliver Caroline Carpenter: So would would that be a customization? Caroline Carpenter: Somewhere in the middle of my 15 week offer Caroline Carpenter: that is going to stay open for the people who stay James Kemp: So if we isolate what we're talking about here in terms of an install offer. The James Kemp: the offer isn't to become a soulful, CEO, etc. James Kemp: It's 1 thing Caroline Carpenter: Okay. It's James Kemp: You, giving them only the tools they need to attract their next soulmate client Caroline Carpenter: Gotcha James Kemp: And then description of that. What is that right? James Kemp: But it's also the description of what they're currently experiencing Caroline Carpenter: Got it James Kemp: Is, you've got clients all over the map James Kemp: doing different things for different people. Some you love. James Kemp: Some

. It's James Kemp: You, giving them only the tools they need to attract their next soulmate client Caroline Carpenter: Gotcha James Kemp: And then description of that. What is that right? James Kemp: But it's also the description of what they're currently experiencing Caroline Carpenter: Got it James Kemp: Is, you've got clients all over the map James Kemp: doing different things for different people. Some you love. James Kemp: Some. You James Kemp: have a a pit in the bottom of your stomach every time your email pings or they message you Caroline Carpenter: awesome. Caroline Carpenter: Okay, I can probably dig more into that to see Caroline Carpenter: so these are short term right. Caroline Carpenter: these are short term install offers that you keep going on in another container that's already been built. Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: You put them into the where the soulful Ceos are, and then they're, oh, there's more work to do. There's more things to do. There's more. James Kemp: there's more path I'm not at. James Kemp:, 10 KA month for 25 clients with 25 clients. I'm not there Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: So there's more opportunity not. There's more work to do, there is. But there's more opportunity Caroline Carpenter: And I don't know what something that would be priced at, but that Caroline Carpenter: might be determined on. What alls Caroline Carpenter: would that be more a I don't want to say a $1,000 offer. That's probably too small. Caroline Carpenter: Guess it would depend on where I'd want to put it James Kemp: Over time. James Kemp: What's it worth to the person Caroline Carpenter: Good point. James Kemp: I can. I can charge. I found charging 10 K. To help someone make 10 K. Very congruent Caroline Carpenter: Rights. Caroline Carpenter: Okay? James Kemp: Especially especially when you're asset building. James Kemp: charging 10 k. To that with an asset that gets an an immediate yield is a ridiculous deal right? James Kemp: Because they get to keep all the upside. After that James Kemp: got it. That initial 10 K. Could turn into a hundred or a million, or whatever, if they do something with it. James Kemp: I. James Kemp: This is where the value equation comes in that that's . James Kemp: if you frame things as building assets, which is what I do James Kemp: Then people have a sense of, okay, this is this is the yield. James Kemp: And anyone who doesn't understand the value in that doesn't fundamentally understand James Kemp: assets return Roi or anything, and they're unlikely to get the result, because if someone thinks that James Kemp: paying 10 K to get 10 k. Back within James Kemp: at 10 K. And the asset back within a few weeks is A is too expensive. James Kemp: They're not going to make it James Kemp:, because they have a very poor understanding of value. Creation yield assets, etc. James Kemp: And, unlike candidly, most people do. Most people have no understanding because they can't understand things over time. James Kemp: and so they just get fixated on what they have now, and they always have that right Caroline Carpenter: This is probably a terrible question. Have you ever had someone Caroline Carpenter: not? Hey? The cause? The way you frame it? It's 5 k. Now. 5 k. Later, and I know you walked through your very specifics. Caroline Carpenter: I don't know Caroline Carpenter: you ever had someone just dupe out on the rest. Or is that more of a I see who you are

. Have you ever had someone Caroline Carpenter: not? Hey? The cause? The way you frame it? It's 5 k. Now. 5 k. Later, and I know you walked through your very specifics. Caroline Carpenter: I don't know Caroline Carpenter: you ever had someone just dupe out on the rest. Or is that more of a I see who you are. You ? Buy a good James Kemp: Definitely Caroline Carpenter: Got that? Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: If if you high converting offers aren't aren't difficult to come, come up with James Kemp: right? They're not. They're not difficult to sell either. James Kemp: And so when you have volume, you're always going to James Kemp: at at scale, you're always gonna have James Kemp: unequal outcomes. You're gonna have people who James Kemp: absolutely crush it. And you're gonna have people who make a couple of payments and then disappear. Or you're gonna have people who are, yeah, this wasn't what you told it was gonna me. It was gonna be because I thought it was going to be much easier. And you're gonna have all of the above James Kemp: right. James Kemp: I've also had people not want to continue and insist on paying me the the second payment. James Kemp: Hey? This was Ama. This was amazing. I don't want to continue in the community. I don't want access to you on the calls, etc, but I'm sending. Tell me where to send the money James Kemp: right? So they honor the agreement. James Kemp: even though they, I'm giving the opportunity to get even more value from it. They decide that they got what they needed, and they're going off and doing it. James Kemp: and and their way or another way. James Kemp: I always come back. But this happens Caroline Carpenter: Oops. Caroline Carpenter: Okay, cool. Caroline Carpenter: Thank you. James Kemp: Shrink it down. James Kemp: Shrink it down to what you can deliver to someone over a period of time Caroline Carpenter: Hmm. James Kemp: Because all all other outcomes will just happen. James Kemp: And the I was speaking to a client privately this week as well as . James Kemp: why do people? Why do so many people stick around for so long in my world? James Kemp: And I because I don't do a lot of the things that you're told to do about retention right? James Kemp: And James Kemp: the only answer I can really come up with is, because I don't need them to, and they they feel that. So it's all about James Kemp: desire and wanting to. James Kemp: It's all about them finding different elements of value from it that aren't just, how much money did you make today. James Kemp: So I'd I James Kemp: don't force people to get value in the way that I want them to see value, which is largely all when things are designed to ascend or retain people as, how much more money are you going to make over a short period of time? James Kemp: I allow people to get different types of value from me and in my world have another coffee. James Kemp: And so the the retention outcome of that is that while I James Kemp: am focused on helping people make money. James Kemp: I'm also James Kemp: very open to how they enjoy that and how they experience it, and what value they get from it, and what value they get to the proximity to me about who I am and the people in that world, and those things James Kemp: which is all to say that James Kemp: that an installer and acquisition offer is focused on a specific result

. James Kemp: I'm also James Kemp: very open to how they enjoy that and how they experience it, and what value they get from it, and what value they get to the proximity to me about who I am and the people in that world, and those things James Kemp: which is all to say that James Kemp: that an installer and acquisition offer is focused on a specific result. James Kemp: but it can have it can be bundled with a lot of benefits that are incidental that are only discovered when we get into motion. James Kemp: What value James Kemp: to come to the calls Jonathan signed up to the install offer a few weeks ago. He's been on my every single syndicate call. He didn't go. I'm joining that because I've I can join the syndicate and those things James Kemp: he's received the benefits from that, and he's experiencing them, etc. And he's making up his own mind about what it's to be in here. Right? James Kemp: So then, if we just focus on being really specific on the install offer. James Kemp: and we include the other pieces as an experience, then it will just it will unfold. James Kemp: Does that make sense Caroline Carpenter: It does so focus on the result. Let them enjoy what they're gonna enjoy and James Kemp: If you get very attached to, I'm going to sell them on this, and then I'm going to keep them forever. And oh, my God, I'm gonna make so much money it will do neither Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: It will, but it James Kemp: it won't deliver the the full spectrum of benefits to both parties, that is, that is available Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Caroline Carpenter: okay. Now, I'm having the conflict of, is it cool that I put my stake in the ground on? Here's what I'm gonna do, and some women are coming with me. But I think that's okay, because I'm not twisting anyone's arm or James Kemp: It's fine. It's I. I enjoy being focused. I enjoy. When someone's James Kemp: I give someone a Google Doc James Kemp: and they go out and they go fucking. James Kemp: Someone bought this is a mind bending experience that I didn't talk to this person. James Kemp: and they sent me a hundred $50, or or those things James Kemp: And when you give someone the experience that's transformation James Kemp: because you don't shift beliefs, the experience does everything you need to then go. James Kemp: Maybe I can do it this way. Maybe it's possible James Kemp: it it introduces some level of faith. James Kemp: Hey, Lana. Lana North: Hello! How are you going James Kemp: Good. Lana North: Good been bubbling away since we spoke about this the other day, and I really think that I've been working on the the change communication recovery accelerator for people. So what I do for context for people is help. Professional leaders who are running change programs to master their communication team engagement so they can deliver the benefits. What? I am Lana North: wondering the the pain point that I'm agitating around is so for a program director who has to go and report to their steering committee, and things are starting to stall or slow down or turn from green to red. That's the pain point that I think is very real for them. What I'm more wondering about is on the Lana North: any recommendations that you have around the Lana North: sales or marketing process before that Lana North: to get people to put up their hand? Because I'm just starting out. I don't have, I have my Linkedin audience, which is 1,100 people. But I don't have a my email list or things that

. That's the pain point that I think is very real for them. What I'm more wondering about is on the Lana North: any recommendations that you have around the Lana North: sales or marketing process before that Lana North: to get people to put up their hand? Because I'm just starting out. I don't have, I have my Linkedin audience, which is 1,100 people. But I don't have a my email list or things that. What would you recommend to get people to put up their hand so that then I can start to have the conversation James Kemp: Yeah. So the the language you just used there was. James Kemp: They're going to the steering committee, and and the project's about to turn from green to red. James Kemp: So there's lots of different ways to message that you could tell a story of projects you've been involved in, that., we're going from green to red, and what happened. James Kemp: and no one likes being chewed out in the in the meeting and etc, etc. And this is the 3rd project that's gone this way. That's, over time and over budget and and all the rest. So there's stories. But the the old pointing finger never fails, which is when you can point to James Kemp: an uncomfortable experience that someone's just had or is about to have. Then you'll have their attention Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: Because they will be attempting not to repeat that, or they will be attempting to avoid that in the future. Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: So all the content that you create is, if your project's about to turn from green to red. James Kemp: we can have a conversation. I can show you how to how to get that back on track in 4 weeks. Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: Because that's an objective measure that is James Kemp: the the most objective measure that you probably have, that there may be others. James Kemp: But that's an objective measure of the experience Lana North: Yeah, I thought in terms of, when we talk about our goal is this is going from orange, orange, or red back to green or staying staying green when it when you're on the cusp of tipping over James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah. And then, over time, you could say, my clients only have green projects. James Kemp:, in terms of communication. And those things that James Kemp: the no more Reds crew is is us. But James Kemp: it's the objective experience that come that that someone has. And we talked about, on the call Lana North: Hmm. James Kemp: The optics inside corporate matter, more than anything. James Kemp: How is the project perceived? To be going is the most important thing. It's much more important than how it's going. But how? What? What picture can you paint for the people that matter which is the people above? You? James Kemp: thing Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: So the the more you can paint a picture of positivity. James Kemp: the in terms of the objective measure, which is, a green project versus a red one. James Kemp: The more engaged they'll be with that Lana North: Yeah, yeah, okay, that'll that'll make sense. So Lana North: in in terms of moving to a bit more of a tactical point of view, it's still doing the same posting outreach to network, and all of that thing. So anything anything else that works really well that Lana North: I should be considering to open the doors or shine the light on James Kemp: With an install offer. The outreach can be pre assumed, which is. James Kemp: hey? I've got. I've got I've got space to get one project back on track. Thanks, Rennie. I've got pro

. So anything anything else that works really well that Lana North: I should be considering to open the doors or shine the light on James Kemp: With an install offer. The outreach can be pre assumed, which is. James Kemp: hey? I've got. I've got I've got space to get one project back on track. Thanks, Rennie. I've got pro. I've got space to get one project back on track in the next 4 weeks. James Kemp: Is your project at red or green at the moment Lana North: Yeah, yeah, cool. James Kemp: Because you can be hyper specific. Lana North: Yep. James Kemp: again. Michael and I talked about this on on Tuesday Syndicate call Going for no. James Kemp: Yes, and the the immediate disqualifier allows us to move on right. James Kemp: And 1 1 of your frustrations over the last 6 months is that long sales cycle that open Lana North: Maybe James Kemp: We'll find budget. We'll do this. I'll get decision maker right Lana North: Yeah, the more you have, the more maybes you have in the system, the more clogged the system is because you have hope. Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: You're they they'll they might. They'll come in Lana North: I'd rather say I'd rather say No, if it's no, and then I'll move James Kemp: Yeah. So you can move on right? James Kemp: So anything that gets a no James Kemp: is just as valuable as getting a yes, because a decision is made Lana North: Yes. Yeah. James Kemp: So binary offers, which the only potential outcome is a yes or a no Lana North: Hmm. James Kemp: There is a not now Lana North: Which is still a no. James Kemp: If, if we own, if we control supply. James Kemp: binary offers will allow a business to to be in flow and in control James Kemp: far more than than offers the initiator. Maybe Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: Because we're we're just switching it on and off and going. I've got 3 spots. James Kemp: but I'm talking to 10 people Lana North: Yep, yeah. Got it cool. That's helpful. Thank you. James Kemp: The toughest the toughest part of that is is that you are setting up to cultivate rejection James Kemp: in the form of nose right. James Kemp: and the common characteristic for people me and and others who trace it back is that James Kemp: I did door to door for 2 years in my own business right. James Kemp: I got a metric shit ton of nose, and I got decondition to them. James Kemp: and that helps me a lot because I can make binary offers and knows they don't. James Kemp: They don't move any emotional needle in me. James Kemp: because I don't. I don't take it as personal rejection Lana North: Yeah, correct attaching my personal meaning to it. James Kemp: That is one of the trade-offs of these type of businesses. James Kemp: right? And, candidly, a lot of people build James Kemp: armor around them in the form of salespeople, and and these and these things to inoculate themselves from rejection. James Kemp: A lot of people build businesses James Kemp: and build the system around them to inoculate themselves from that rejection because they they take it so personally. James Kemp: Every time something happens they're just on this James Kemp: fucking emotional our client left. Oh, my God, I'm useless. James Kemp: What my mom said when I was 5 was right. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Oh, my God! And then, Shut down for 2 days James Kemp: there is

# New Transcripts James - Part 6

. Steve Roberts: He's not quite there yet, but yet he's still with me. So Steve Roberts: when you said you're helping them find the route to their freedom, I think that was really Steve Roberts: quite well, well, put as far as my experience working with that particular client is, it's Steve Roberts: peeling back the layers Shrek. keep it James Kemp: Yeah. And it's not judging it as well that James Kemp: that an adult male, it would be easy to judge that that an adult male is scared of taking a shirt off in public James Kemp: he's not scared of nuclear war, or his family dying in a car accident, or anything he's scared of taking his shirt off. James Kemp: and it would be really easy to judge that right. But the significance of that to that individual is huge. James Kemp: It's really huge Steve Roberts: Yeah. Yeah. Steve Roberts: And and just to add on that, for someone who hasn't had a fear of that before, it is difficult Steve Roberts: to try and position that as a problem for others. Steve Roberts: because you don't have the problem yourself. So that was one thing I was gonna . Steve Roberts:, if you don't have a problem with something, how do you raise the problem of something James Kemp: That's called empathy Steve Roberts: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: Bye, I have lots of money. James Kemp: and I'm not embarrassed to say that I'm quite rich, right. James Kemp: but it's really easy for me to help to wake up every day and go. James Kemp: How does everyone make more money? People want to make more money. Do you want money it's? It's a good resource to have right James Kemp: my needs. James Kemp: I fulfill my own needs, and I am highly empathetic and effective at what I do. James Kemp: because I don't judge what other people's needs are Steve Roberts: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: I have literal millionaires crying with me about how they feel broke James Kemp: because they're friends with billionaires and stuff that. James Kemp: And sometimes and I laugh with them usually right, but I don't judge it at all. James Kemp: It's it's comedy. James Kemp: I'm you don't feel safe. They don't feel safe. James Kemp: They're a human being, and the the reason that most people are James Kemp: a broke is because they judge other people's needs. I don't want that. Well, no one gives a fuck what you want. Really. James Kemp: you're there to fulfill your own needs. James Kemp: So empathy is, is putting yourself in someone's shoes and saying. James Kemp: taking your shirt off at the beach, or making another 10 million dollars, or whatever a valid goals. James Kemp: at least, for now Steve Roberts: Hmm. James Kemp: But along the way maybe we reframe it. James Kemp: because I bet if you worked with that guy long enough you probably he could probably not lose another kilo. James Kemp: and if he was coached on on a dimension of self-esteem he'd be taking his shirt off because he realizes it didn't matter. James Kemp: Just the guys chasing the next 1 million. And the next 10 million realizes it didn't really matter. James Kemp: It was just an irrational fear Steve Roberts: Yeah, that's correct. Steve Roberts: That's empathy. James Kemp: Empathy is understanding, that the that the individual human experience James Kemp: is exactly that it's individual, it's reality. This thing we call reality is consensus reality. The individual's reality is the individual

. James Kemp: Just the guys chasing the next 1 million. And the next 10 million realizes it didn't really matter. James Kemp: It was just an irrational fear Steve Roberts: Yeah, that's correct. Steve Roberts: That's empathy. James Kemp: Empathy is understanding, that the that the individual human experience James Kemp: is exactly that it's individual, it's reality. This thing we call reality is consensus reality. The individual's reality is the individual. James Kemp: What they're scared of, what you're scared of, what I'm scared of and James Kemp: utterly different things. And it's our job not to judge it Steve Roberts: Yeah. Steve Roberts: And I could probably lead with John there. Sometimes you feel you're posting too much, not getting much back, and it's, oh, shit if I stay quiet, post the odd thing and someone reacts. Oh, then that was a good strategy, whereas you never know who this could be, for it could be the the rich guy who's still afraid to take you the beach, and he could be in the very high percentage of people who take action or problem solvers, but haven't solved this one problem themselves. Steve Roberts: So your marketing piece might be Steve Roberts: talking to all level of action takers Steve Roberts: who still might have a problem with that. Steve Roberts: So just because you swing it doesn't mean you're gonna hit. Steve Roberts: The action takers who are still Steve Roberts: not comfortable with their shit off at the beach. James Kemp: Yeah, there's lots of variables in terms of audience and state they're in and how they consume stuff and what they buy Steve Roberts: Right. James Kemp: But the the most effective marketing talks to unspoken needs Steve Roberts: Talks, to James Kemp: Unspoken needs. Steve Roberts: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's great. I'm just to close the loop on that on the social posting of that. You're not gonna send invitation. It's Steve Roberts: something different. But, I'm looking for people who, in this high level program Steve Roberts: your social post is around that subject. Steve Roberts: Let me know if you want the If James Kemp: Well, I'd I'd be talking in content in this scenario. James Kemp: A lot more to the not, hey? He lost 15 kilos Steve Roberts: Hmm. James Kemp: It's hey? He can now take a shirt off at the beach. After not doing that for 18 years. Steve Roberts: Yeah. Yeah. Steve Roberts: Great. James Kemp: why, James Kemp: lots of people want a business so they can tell their mom and dad that they made it Steve Roberts: Very subtle, James, isn't it? Steve Roberts: It's just a it's a subtle tweak of the. James Kemp: It's it's the. James Kemp: It's the base human needs, right? James Kemp: And all the things that we do. And there, we say, are just just just constructed on top of those base human needs James Kemp: for safety, for social acceptance, for reproduction. Steve Roberts: . James Kemp: Accumulation of power is just a vectoring away from threat. James Kemp: having a social group and having friends or being attractive to the opposite sex is just a vector, away from James Kemp: from threat. James Kemp: Right? So it's safety Steve Roberts: I knew I took the Dao of teaching for another reason today, James. Thank you. James Kemp: If you, if you, if you talk to the underlying pieces. James Kemp: you can still be in the market of selling weight loss, selling money Steve Roberts: Hmm

. James Kemp: having a social group and having friends or being attractive to the opposite sex is just a vector, away from James Kemp: from threat. James Kemp: Right? So it's safety Steve Roberts: I knew I took the Dao of teaching for another reason today, James. Thank you. James Kemp: If you, if you, if you talk to the underlying pieces. James Kemp: you can still be in the market of selling weight loss, selling money Steve Roberts: Hmm. James Kemp: But if you talk to the underlying pieces of the of the actual needs of the individual James Kemp: and and their desires, you will capture far more James Kemp: intent based attention than anyone else. James Kemp: Right? People don't James Kemp: lose weight for the sake of losing weight. They don't make money for the sake of making money, of accumulating and sitting in massive piles. They they do it for James Kemp: for safety, for status, which is again James Kemp: are moving away from unsafe. Steve Roberts: Yeah, type. James Kemp: So if we talk to just those things below the surface. James Kemp: we get the people who are you're talking to me. James Kemp: And, at a very simplistic level. This is why people are told to be authentic on social media. James Kemp: but that's turned into performative authenticity of . James Kemp: Hey, I broke my foot. Come to my webinar, and you're what the fuck's that got to do with anything James Kemp: right. And this is why vulnerability James Kemp: will always get large points of attention. But again, it's then manipulated into types of attention to. James Kemp: I broke out with my girlfriend, give me $97. You're, what, what are these things got to do with each other? Right Steve Roberts: It's James Kemp: But if if we talk to the if we talk to the underlying human motivations, then we are. James Kemp: are hacking into someone's subconscious. James Kemp: which is, we are talking to things that maybe they wouldn't even talk about within James Kemp: partner or the people closest to them insecurities. James Kemp: And again, the more outward someone is, often the more inward they are with those insecurities Steve Roberts: In the white. You would elude that Steve Roberts: problem that you help them overcome Steve Roberts: in your social posts. We go, hey? It's chatting. One of the guys in my group the other day, and Steve Roberts: we've we've moved a long way. We've come a long way. You don't talk about the specifics I guess of. He's lost 15 kgs, and he's lifting James Kemp: You do, because objective measures are meaningful too. Steve Roberts: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: But you talk to the thing that it's done. Steve Roberts: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: I James Kemp: Jk shared a couple of weeks ago how he's at 100 KA month because he stated that, 17 months ago. He's going to get to 100 KA month. James Kemp: It's way cooler him talking about getting married this month James Kemp: and going on honeymoon for 2 months, and then. James Kemp: there's something else happening as well. But it's way cooler for that. James Kemp: Then it's what it breeds in his life. James Kemp: Yeah, he came to me for to make more money. James Kemp: but he did it so he could do these other things safely. Steve Roberts: You just use your initials. Are you talking about an example of a person James Kemp: Yeah. Jk molina. Steve Roberts: Oh, sorry, Ron. I thought you were talking about yourself

. But it's way cooler for that. James Kemp: Then it's what it breeds in his life. James Kemp: Yeah, he came to me for to make more money. James Kemp: but he did it so he could do these other things safely. Steve Roberts: You just use your initials. Are you talking about an example of a person James Kemp: Yeah. Jk molina. Steve Roberts: Oh, sorry, Ron. I thought you were talking about yourself. Steve Roberts: Thought it might be more than that James Kemp: He calls himself young Jk. And oh! Steve Roberts: Legend. James Kemp: Tapping, tapping human desire is how James Kemp: we speak to the experience of the people that we help. James Kemp: We layer over the the objective measures of specificity. James Kemp: But in our content and context, where James Kemp: to the best of our ability, talking about what? That, what that gets them James Kemp:. Losing weight isn't a James Kemp: isn't a path to being later on escape James Kemp: as a path to potentially being feeling better about oneself James Kemp: individually, but also feeling better about what oneself, so they so they can James Kemp: date for the 1st time before . Be on tinder for the 1st time in 5 years, or whatever it is James Kemp: making money is not James Kemp: just a greedy capitalist accumulation of it. So you feel you're a success in the eyes of your mom. For the, 1st time in 22 years. James Kemp: There's there's there's layers upon layers of these things, as I said to., Lana, a lot of James Kemp: in the corporate world. It's politics, right it is. James Kemp: impressing those above you enough to be one of those above you one day. Right? That's the that's the imperative of the of the of many corporate minds. James Kemp: And so what it looks matters a lot. James Kemp: So let's make sure that we make them look good in the course of helping people and corporate in those environments, because James Kemp: what it looks offer matters more than what it is right. And so we we have to understand James Kemp: the motivations and the environment that the people we work in., what are they? James Kemp: And the more we judge them, the more it blocks us from those things we can say whatever we about James Kemp: taking your shirt off at the beach, and sexual dynamics and corporate dynamics and making money and all these things. But if we sit there in judgment, then it James Kemp: it takes away a lot of our ability to to communicate with people who want James Kemp: more than just the thing on the surface. It's just the thing on the surface is the thing we point to. James Kemp: and then our ability to communicate it as the as the thing that they ultimately get out of it. James Kemp: Okay, Peeps. James Kemp: I'll put up the replay resources and template James Kemp: in the community in a couple hours, and then. James Kemp: if you're a guest, we'll put it on that James Kemp: on the page that you've we sent out last night, and this morning. James Kemp: Thanks, Peeps. James Kemp: I'll see the syndicate folks this afternoon. James Kemp: Bye bye. Quarterly Updates Call: What's up, Ru? I love how there's people I know and people, I dunno, just combining the communities baby. If you're from James' community and James isn't here yet, he is nominated me as your new leader. Unfortunately, you guys are stuck with me., no, I see he is here. what's funny is that it was, I texted him two days ago

. James Kemp: Bye bye. Quarterly Updates Call: What's up, Ru? I love how there's people I know and people, I dunno, just combining the communities baby. If you're from James' community and James isn't here yet, he is nominated me as your new leader. Unfortunately, you guys are stuck with me., no, I see he is here. what's funny is that it was, I texted him two days ago. I was, Hey, are you good for Thursday? And he is, yep. If the baby doesn't come yet, if for those of you who don't know, his, his, fiance is pregnant. And so if he jumps out during this call, we all extend forgiveness of good vibes as he, goes through the rite of passage of becoming a dad Once again. What's up James? The mop. The mop and the bucket are there to clean up the waters, when they're broke. Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh dude, I'm pumped for this call. 'cause we haven't touched base a little bit. The last time, time we touched base I was in America and you're, I have five minutes before clients get here for an event. And so Yeah. Where's the timing, right? Yeah., well we've got two communities here and, but there's probably no lack of people who are winning in some capacity. When you just take a moment to celebrate yourself and just drop in the chat. Where have you won recently? Big, small personal business. I'd really love to invite you to, as we, as we step into this call and we focus on things to do and opportunities, just take a moment and celebrate, whether people in this chat or you do not, this call I should say., we're all here to celebrate with you., any particular ones you wanna highlight? James? Yeah. Tack on any, tack on any ways your clients are winning because Oh, yeah. I love that. I'm, I'm reminded a lot that we win through people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The more we help other people win, the more we win, and it's a big happy circle. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not great at celebrating clients', clients winning. Yeah, of course. And I probably should ask that question a lot more. No, I think that's really, really good., while we're waiting for people to drop stuff in the chat, is there any, anyone in particular that you wanna highlight that might, may or may not be on the call? We always have amazing, wins in our community there. Anything that comes to mind for you? I just, to honor Janine Ghana because Janine's a Janine came to see me in Bali. Well, I say a few weeks ago. Everything feels a few weeks ago at the moment, but it's a couple of months ago now. And I, I remember what it was trying to battle those two worlds of being in the corporate world and having these sweet, sweet, big checks, raining out of the sky and we want you to speak and we want you to do this. And then trying to build something with a little bit more leverage, a little bit more freedom on the side and straddling that. And Janine's had an amazing quarter, put some great numbers on the scoreboard, but she's also straddle those two worlds beautifully as well, and said no to stuff and said yes to stuff as well. So I know how challenging it is. So I wanna honor that Guys. Shout out Janine, that's amazing., I want to shout out this guy who just joined an inner circle, a couple weeks ago. His name is Teo. He's on this call., by the way, if you guys can't do video, totally get it

. So I know how challenging it is. So I wanna honor that Guys. Shout out Janine, that's amazing., I want to shout out this guy who just joined an inner circle, a couple weeks ago. His name is Teo. He's on this call., by the way, if you guys can't do video, totally get it. If you're driving, please don't crash. But if you're just being antisocial, I invite you to turn your cameras on., as I promise you, it will be a more electric call if we, if James and I don't feel we're just talking to ourselves., so Teo, came to the Mexico intensive. So every intensive I run, it's free for clients. And, we have guests come in and Teo messaged me. He signed up. We had a very, very short back and forth, and I really couldn't catch his vibe at all. And little did I know he was, natively Spanish speaker, English, second language. And I was, trying to figure out, who is this guy? And so anyway, he comes to the event and he tells me that he bought a hundred dollars product that I have called Inbox Income. The next month he made $40,000 replicating that, that system in the Spanish market. And then he signed up for Inner Circle. And I was, firstly, this is the most nonlinear way to become a client., normally you don't get results that from a hundred dollars thing, and then you don't come to an event first. But I was just blown away because Teo is 18 years old and his business partner is at the ripe old age of 19. And it was just so crazy to see these two amazing humans in Mexico doing work. Not just learning funnel stuff that's accessible for anyone now, but doing really meaningful work around leadership in, in a game, at 18 and 19., I was barely, I'd barely stopped playing with Lego at 18. And so to see where they are now was unbelievable., so shout out Teo and shout out Janine., there's a bunch of wins in here., Ian landed two figure, two, seven figure earners, not two figure earners. I guess that would be they made a dollar or $10, from cold traffic. YouTube. That's amazing. Justin sold six memberships in his group., two workshop tickets. Client made her first dollar ever online. That's epic. The first dollar man, dude, I'm telling you, the first dollar is harder than the, than the first 10,000., that's epic. Jared got 80 downloads of his book in last week after five rounds of testing landing page clients winning team worked with last year. And built foundations are undefeated. Kyla got six new clients in the last two weeks with a new offer. That's epic. My man Ray, just had a client able to contribute to their retirement for the first time since starting their business. That's, that's meaningful, dude. That's amazing., Elizabeth Benny, clients are freaking transforming. Big tears are transformational all around making money, marriages, repairing clients, setting up for themselves. That's very, very cool., there's a whole bunch more here, but that is, Caroline got seven returning clients to a new program. Absolutely Epic., Zach Sson, I do not know you, but I see your face all over my feed. So great to see you on this. Great to see you on this call., well, James, let's get into this kind of raw messy format that we, we've obviously perfected after one previous call, this, but, I think we'll be, We're gonna run a workshop on, on messy Catchups. Totally. This is, you guys have all been auto deducted another a hundred dollars. We've auto, we've auto deducted your credit cards

James Kemp: I say, I want to start. James Kemp: Everyone can see my screen. Good. Everyone can hear me fine James Kemp: and members, and to get people. Let's go straight into the classroom this afternoon, after. I guess we will give it as James Kemp: a single replay our first, and then I'll edit it over the next couple of weeks, and you'll have access to that, too. James Kemp: along with all the resources. So anything I show you today you get access to. James Kemp: So the 3 K code white people buy. So today is all about, I'm going to give you context. But today is all about assembling, crafting, and delivering a high, converting hybrid offer James Kemp: and I want the theme of all of this. We need the theme of all of this to make it simple. James Kemp: because everybody James Kemp: fucks it up when they get complicated when they think they are an exception, or you're looking for reasons why. And most of those are James Kemp: emotional and getting in the way. James Kemp: Because the 3. The 3 code is meant to be a prescription. James Kemp: So when we assemble that as a formula. so I do give variables. James Kemp: and, in the Q. And A. Afterwards we will talk about your specific variables, and I teach you how to think along the journey. But results will flow from following the prescription. So my job's to give you the prescription. James Kemp: And this formula is designed to be tight and minimal. I do not spend a lot of time or much really, or paying lip service to mindset or blockers, or particular reasons why it won't work or or will work. James Kemp: It fails if you try and look for complexity or more. Okay. James Kemp: because your job is assemble tests learn in a record. and all results James Kemp: in business happen in the marketplace. It doesn't happen in the consumption of ideas. And we all love ideas. We all love insight. We all love learning new things and gaining new insights because we get that little hit, and it feels exciting. But most people get in their own way James Kemp: to prevent themselves getting in the game. All the mine stuff of why, it won't work for me, or I'm an exceptional these pieces, but I can give you the formula. James Kemp: but you must mix the potion and apply it. James Kemp: The most difficult thing about working with me is I break it down into the simple bits that people don't, because then it becomes unavoidable that you have to do something with it. James Kemp: So this is a a prescription and a formula. but it's up to you to apply it. So James Kemp: the system we use. And there's some essential stages of evolution as we go into a marketplace

. James Kemp: but you must mix the potion and apply it. James Kemp: The most difficult thing about working with me is I break it down into the simple bits that people don't, because then it becomes unavoidable that you have to do something with it. James Kemp: So this is a a prescription and a formula. but it's up to you to apply it. So James Kemp: the system we use. And there's some essential stages of evolution as we go into a marketplace. So to generate a client, we can simply break it into phases. We can have a lead. So someone within the right to communicate with a customer someone who's transacted with us or a client, someone who we commit time resources to. James Kemp: And these distinctions are very useful and important, because they allow us to design for those particular stages. James Kemp: and then we can break it down, because, to obtain a client efficiently. Most demonstrate confidence in each stage. So people can skip any of these stages. Someone can become a lead and quickly become a client. But this is an exception rather than the rule. James Kemp: Daniel, yesterday who was we were talking about? The send to get back and forth is . James Kemp: Hey, I this. You can try before you buy, and that is exactly the frame of a customer versus a client. This is an interaction. Does he it? What what's it gonna do? What does it work? Let's have a look under the hood to see how it feels, etc., etc. James Kemp: So for a client to ascend and identify themselves. We must understand intent and desire. And the fastest way to understand intent is desire and initiate a transaction, get someone to give you money James Kemp: right? Because behind that is some intent and a single signal of desire. So for someone to give you money, you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something to desire. James Kemp: So the system we are building James Kemp: is just this blueprint. James Kemp: We have James Kemp: 2 levels of client offer. We have at most a couple of customer offers. James Kemp: And then we have a big idea, and that sequence is very important. James Kemp: And it's very distinct in terms of how we're going to work through. James Kemp: So for clients, we have a community offer and one upgrade option James Kemp: for customers. We have one-time products to generate, customers in cash flow. And ultimately this model is offer-driven. James Kemp: So we get leads. We turn them into customers, and we turn those customers into clients James Kemp: it's nothing more difficult than that. But simple and easier different things. James Kemp: And this is the model I use because I aim to do as little selling and marketing as possible. James Kemp: I just want to demonstrate and make offers. James Kemp: This is the thing that works for me is how it could work for you. Do you want some help doing it. James Kemp: and that is available to everybody. So, working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long-term relationships and to find those I create clients and help them generate value. James Kemp: to find clients. I generate customers to understand their intent, and to find customers, and demonstrate my ideas, to earn attention and trust. If we approach everything as an offer, whether it's free or paid, it helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible. James Kemp: So if I can leave you with one thing is teaching you how to think about making offers. You'll have a highly efficient, highly lucrative, highly fun business. James Kemp: because it will. People will find their natural place James Kemp: because clients are not created equal and power laws apply. the majority of the market are James Kemp: in pain and have a problem and are relatively opportunity unaware

. James Kemp: So if I can leave you with one thing is teaching you how to think about making offers. You'll have a highly efficient, highly lucrative, highly fun business. James Kemp: because it will. People will find their natural place James Kemp: because clients are not created equal and power laws apply. the majority of the market are James Kemp: in pain and have a problem and are relatively opportunity unaware. James Kemp: The the majority of the market will be down there where they'll spend, up to, a few $100 with you at the most, and never go from there. James Kemp: There's a portion of the market that are problem aware, but solution unaware. James Kemp: They know they don't have enough leads. They know they don't have enough dates. They know they are overweight, but they don't know which path to choose to solve. Those get out of that pain and solve those problems right? There are lots of solutions in front of them. James Kemp:, and our and our goal is to educate them about our solution. So they have the opportunity to James Kemp: evolve James Kemp: and ascend. James Kemp: And then there's the core. There's solution aware and desire results. Those are the people that we have as clients. James Kemp: So they spend much larger amounts. They stay for a lot longer because they are James Kemp: very problem, aware of what they need to solve. James Kemp: And you help them become problem aware. and the very solution, aware that they're aligned with your particular solution. James Kemp: And then there's a transformation. . I've had clients and partners and relationships that that span a decade or more right. They are very, very few people in the marketplace to do that. These are the people that my world a license I mentor, I partner with them. I have Equity or Jvs or these people. James Kemp: But when you understand power laws in the marketplace, it removes a lot of fear and a lot of scarcity, and just understanding that not everybody is going to move to the next stage. Not everybody James Kemp: should move to the next stage and come into your inner circle. And the piece about the the primary thing about running the highly efficient offer driven business James Kemp: is that it's not for everybody, and people are always at the right stage. James Kemp: What I can say is, there are people in your audience and leads and customers that will happily pay you 50 times what others will. You just need the right offer to enable them to do so? James Kemp: So in a power and a power law offer driven environment. We're making offers. And we when people settle where they settle. James Kemp: So James Kemp: that's fine in terms of the, the philosophy and the theory. But how do we do it? So James Kemp: we're going to plot a straight line to a million dollars. And we're going to work James Kemp: along 2 dimensions. The first one is the order of work that we have to do, and the second one is the order of application that people must go through to get there. James Kemp: So pricing is both an art and a science. James Kemp: To get to a million in one year, you need to average $83,333 in revenue every month. You have 2 tiers and your client offer. James Kemp: and I'm throwing a lot of lingo at you. Don't forget you get this document, and you can decipher these, that as you go along, a lot of you send it to folks will be familiar, I guess less so. James Kemp: but that you have 2 tiers in your client offer. You have a tier one. You have a community offer. and on tier 2 you have consulting

. You have 2 tiers and your client offer. James Kemp: and I'm throwing a lot of lingo at you. Don't forget you get this document, and you can decipher these, that as you go along, a lot of you send it to folks will be familiar, I guess less so. James Kemp: but that you have 2 tiers in your client offer. You have a tier one. You have a community offer. and on tier 2 you have consulting. James Kemp: If you have 15 tier, 2 clients, an average 600 bucks a week that generates just over 38 grand a month. James Kemp: If you have 50 tier, one clients on average, a hundred $50 a week James Kemp: that generates 32,000 in revenue. James Kemp: So your total monthly revenue. at 70,000 from clients just requires signing 1.2 5 clients per week. So when you break it down, it's not that scary. If you sell 30 customer offers at a hundred dollars a week. James Kemp: and Gen. You generate another almost 13 grand. James Kemp: and you're over that number only 4%. Of your customers need to convert to clients to hit your numbers James Kemp: in my world. That's between 11 or 15. So 11 and 15% of people who buy my customer office end up becoming clients to some degree. James Kemp: So we choose pricing that maximizes conversions and economics. James Kemp: And James Kemp: I debated this, shall I give you ranges? Shall I, then? And I'm just gonna give you James Kemp: the numbers if that's okay with you. Because I got 5 years of data behind this, and I'm just going to give you the shortcut. James Kemp: So a community offer James Kemp: at one to $200 a week and a 3 K. Paid in full for the year. We'll work with the widest range of markets. James Kemp: I've seen that work over and over and over again in multiple markets and multiple vertical calls and multiple categories, multiple affordability. B, 2 BB to C, James Kemp: and consulting offers at 3 to 600. Sell to the right people in the right ratios. James Kemp: . So those people who want more help from you personally James Kemp: that sells in the right ratios again, in multiple markets. James Kemp: multiple modalities and multiple verticals. James Kemp: So James Kemp: if your $100 customer offer converts 5 5 to 15 cent of bias into clients. James Kemp: This is the path of least resistance. James Kemp: So if it's okay with you, we got some pricing. James Kemp: You can charge higher prices. James Kemp: You can use sevens and nines and angel numbers, and it's more likely to divert you from the path and keep you on it. James Kemp: because the creativity is better better deployed into products into your clients. James Kemp: So James Kemp: let's stick to the prescription, and then you can experiment after you follow the simple path. James Kemp: So to hit a million. It is critical. We attack in the right order. So this is what we are doing together over the next 3 days. James Kemp: So the common approach is to work forwards from marketing to sales, to offer people go I. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it

. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it. Then you need to decipher all those variables, and most people fail James Kemp: because they're being sold to by marketers whose default choice is marketing. James Kemp: and the best way to head a goal is not to work towards it is to work backwards from it James Kemp: because working fords is chaotic because there's so many potential variables, there's hundreds of ways to market and lot of them work. There's hundreds of ways to sell and a lot of them work. James Kemp: But working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage. James Kemp: because over a long enough time period and everybody's tried that we all have both approaches, get you to the goal, but working backwards, gets you there faster and with more certainty. James Kemp: So we're going to do 3 things James Kemp: we're going to create and validate a threek offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc. And that's what we're going to focus on today. James Kemp: We're going to create and sell a customer offer that converts 5% of its buyers into clients for you James Kemp: in that offer that we've just defined. James Kemp: Then we're going to automate the lead flow and the customer offer and Nsn. Customers into clients every week. James Kemp: So we go from making 3 K. And validating that to 3 KA week to 3 KA day. James Kemp: So we use 3 systems to do this. The hybrid offer James Kemp: which I'll talk about today, customers to clients and the daily client machine. James Kemp: The sequence is very, very, very, very important. because each of these systems solve for a specific stage. and we've got a master one before moving to the next one. James Kemp: and that's the right pace. James Kemp: Right? You may be at different stages, and everybody here is at different stages of the current offer of the marketing of the flow. James Kemp: But skipping steps is not speed. I constantly go back and reevaluate my offer based on feedback. James Kemp: One of the reasons that we use Google Docs is because it's dynamic, right? You can put it on the sales page. And those things later. Once you have something that converts at 30 to 40, James Kemp: but it's dynamic. I'm tweaking words. I'm tweaking, positioning all the time. James Kemp: so skipping steps is not speed. It sometimes feels it. I can just jump straight to marketing. I need more leads, so I can just jump jump to that. But it's just skipping steps. James Kemp: So mastery and the sequence compounds. The better your hybrid offer. The more clients you convert. the better your customers to client system, the more customers and clients you generate. and the better your daily client machine, the more leads turn into customers who turn into clients and and it compounds in action. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate

. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate. If you, if you're writing, marketing and messaging organically, or if you move to ads and then add start working, it doesn't add to just amplification of good content. But good content is created from good messaging, which is, which is created from good office. James Kemp: So I need you to understand the sequence, because the sequence is what delays most people because they work front to back, whereas we were back to front. James Kemp: So let's get into the hybrid offer. James Kemp: So traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for durations. James Kemp: It's simple, but it's just easier than simple. That's why the majority use it right? So the hybrid addresses this by selling a rock across a range of prices and times with a single offer. James Kemp: Simplicity is having one offer. and you only need one offer. James Kemp: and there is a useful distinction between offers and products is really made. You need a lot of ways to make the offer. James Kemp: But you don't need many products, and you don't need many actual offers. So hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it. So we sign them up for an ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes and timelines along the duration. James Kemp: Before we get to that James Kemp: we've got to define. Why, people buy. And again, the more variables that you insert here, the longer it takes to get results. James Kemp: But there are 4 core reasons. People buy help James Kemp: to make more money to save money, to stay legal or live a better life. James Kemp:, and the majority of people that sit in the make more money all have a better life. buckets James Kemp: stay legal as compliance, and some of those and some of those are real blue oceans because people really need them., and save money is a different market altogether. But saving money can be a, a core benefit of people who often save people. Time James Kemp: you only solve for one core James Kemp: and all the other benefits that are are exactly that they are benefits. James Kemp: So there's a huge difference between these 2 businesses. You help business owners build systems free up time so they can make more money. You help business owners build systems to make more money, so they can have more time. James Kemp: Both businesses do the same thing. James Kemp: The functional things they do but are the same. Yet both companies will attract a very different type of customer. James Kemp: because one is seeking a better life. and it's in a different stage usually, and one is seeking more money. James Kemp: And if you offer both James Kemp: as your core benefit. Both you and your client will be confused. James Kemp: and we see this all the time. That direct, that getting away from the core and talking about all the benefits. James Kemp: confuses you and confuses the market. Right? So personally, I solve for making money. James Kemp: and the stem of that is from one of my core beliefs that true freedom is downstream from from financial freedom. James Kemp: So the core piece about me and my orientation towards the market is making money

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 12

life and a and a and a human world is about expectations and if you don't if you if you coach someone to do something but you're telling them what they want and what to do and you think you're coaching them but you're Consulting to them you're setting an expectation that this thing is going to be right for them rather than allowing to discover it themselves and that will Downstream have an effect on their application of that piece their their their results from it and ultimately their desire to continue it a lot of people have told a lot of people to do things in the in the hope that it was in their best interests that turned out to be damaging and if you correct if you set their correct expectations with people and yourself then everybody is clean and clear going forward and there's no overhang into areas that that can then then blow back to blow back in either party's lives got it it's I think a big theme of you in general is self-confrontation and self- honesty you lie to yourself you'll lie to your clients you'll lie to everyone around you and there's you're always going to be living with that cognitive dissonance until you have to face the music one day and realize that it's been you the bowling ball crashing down everything in its way yeah that that's that's the benefit that I have of being old right I'm a I'm an old man in a young man's game in sense of that that I can I can see what's coming because I've been there and and those pieces and I and I provide a huge amount of value to people in my world because of that because I I can see Over the Horizon because I've already I've already stepped over there and there will be monsters and I can tell you not to go for that one but maybe we can guide you towards this one which might be preferable so how does somebody get to the point of being able to solve the the energy problems the what I have in my mind is the agency owner that's saying make give me little money I give you big money but there's a big asteris there which is you have to work 10 more hours a week to get this next level of money and once the client realizes that they quickly cancel because they don't want to sift through all the the bad leads etc etc yeah they didn't realize all this stuff came with it can you speak to that how do I how do I become the person that can consult the orthodontist on the retirement strategy and that whole thing which feels playing in Disneyland compared to 10 of these Facebook leads never answered the phone and I'm canceling right now which does not feel anything Disneyland to most agency owners and and part of the reason that they're getting burned out yeah yeah so I I'm going to I'm going to default to the Strategic answer for this but one of the major things that I help and nudge and encourage and occasionally force people to do is sell a sell a future ID entity it's very difficult for people to do things if they can't see what they lead to right yeah and it's it's very difficult to for to ask people to change in terms of behaviorally unless they can have a some sense of who they change into who they ultimately become and in the agency world there's a lot of talk about what you can do for people but there's very little talk about what that adds and what that brings to them in terms of at that that life level and that's just about abstracting and understanding that if you're an orthodontist who you know in this initial period if you're work an extra 10 hours a week in the future you'll get 20 hours a week back :04 to play golf that's a different conversation right it's putting the truth on the table and saying as you'll :10 agree Mr business owner this requires investment we we require investment of time we require investment of money but :17 you'll get this back in multiples down the track because we

and understanding that if you're an orthodontist who you know in this initial period if you're work an extra 10 hours a week in the future you'll get 20 hours a week back :04 to play golf that's a different conversation right it's putting the truth on the table and saying as you'll :10 agree Mr business owner this requires investment we we require investment of time we require investment of money but :17 you'll get this back in multiples down the track because we Elevate you from operator to chairman in the business and :24 he's going ah I'm an operator right now I'd love to be a chairman but I need to invest something in the way so it is :31 getting the truth on the table and saying these are the things that you want these are the this is the price we :37 have to pay to some degree in the short term but this is the payoff because when you become the the the the orthodontist :45 chairman then then they start to go yeah I'm just chairman of the board and I'm playing golf and you :52 know I'm not I'm not there in there day today pushing the buttons and chasing the payments and and those pieces so the :58 identity layer in in marketing if you and in terms of positioning is :05 one that's often neglected because we focus on the functional things that :10 people do in the short term but when you start introducing that future identity piece about selling people on and you :16 know indicating who they become not only do you convert more people in the front end because you're taking away the risk :23 of change but you also get better buying in the application of that delivery because everybody's agreed that there's :29 a bigger payoff at the end because everybody's up leveled in the process of doing it got it so it's about figuring :36 out what that vision is so that you can paint it for your client it's not figuring out is giving it to them :43 because the brutal truth is most people LA Vision for themselves and for their lives but if you can paint a picture :48 that's desirable to them at least put lead them toward the promised land and and and they understand it and :55 what the alod dontist might find that he starts playing golf but he's better off that he loved :00 volunteering at the dog shelter but you gave him the space and the time to do that but via a mutual :06 investment and you both and you both committed to play the game so so giving them a future identity is about :12 spelling that out about what they become and who they become and then allowing that allowing that to unfold and :18 allowing them to discover it I have a concept called The Sovereign consultant I have that's a I'm :24 selling people on being a sovereign consultant who makes a million dollars profit a year in two days a week with :31 65 clients or less right what when you get there how you do it what you want to enjoy in the teams if you :37 want to work three days a week go for it but at least we got to it at least we agreed on the on the on the endpoint and :45 and we both understand that the map is in the terrain and the system I give people is is a coloring book :51 that you buy I give you guidelines and boundaries and don't color outside that line but the Stop Needing, Start Attracting :59 colors you put in in in between are completely up to you yeah and final sorry with with help :08 of course and guidance yeah yeah of course final question there how do you put :14 in your Outreach or your content I'm thinking of someone :20 who messaged me last week hey Katen if I if I could add $50,000 a month to what :28 you're doing if it's $50,000 a month in your business and in the next 60 :35 days my my immediate thought and I

between are completely up to you yeah and final sorry with with help :08 of course and guidance yeah yeah of course final question there how do you put :14 in your Outreach or your content I'm thinking of someone :20 who messaged me last week hey Katen if I if I could add $50,000 a month to what :28 you're doing if it's $50,000 a month in your business and in the next 60 :35 days my my immediate thought and I would consider myself maybe someone who's dealing with higher level issues :42 at this point my immediate thought is that sounds exhausting whatever it is you're pitching I don't really want :47 it because I don't need it and I think it goes back to what you're saying the more the more you :54 don't need the money the more money will come to you but that's the same the :01 the clients that people really want are the people that don't that aren't desperate for the extra 10K or the extra 50k :08 they're desperate for some need inside them how do :14 you what's your advice to someone just a an easy way to start implementing :21 that in their Outreach or their content or their ads Outreach is a is an interesting inter one because most :26 people their goal is to drive a conversation to do some convincing and some :32 showing so if I was to do cold Outreach and if you ever catch me doing cold :37 Outreach come over here and do something terrible to me but if you ever if I ever did cold Outreach I would :46 be sending it to someone who I believed would be the ideal person that I could :52 deliver a result for that I'd already delivered so if I was demonstrating to :57 you that I could give you $50,000 extra a month and get you 15 hours a week back :04 I would send you a demonstration of that I would send you a demonstration of this is :09 Bob he's an orthodontist and we got him an extra $50,000 a month while cutting his :16 working hours of this and I would demonstrate Bob on a camera that was :21 chilled and having a natural conversation about telling his experience and doing it rather than :27 saying I can do this for you and the the framers that a lot of people try to be :33 is the hero of someone's Journey but if you're if you make them :39 if you make your clients the hero and you the guide It's funny how your your the quality of what you do and who you :45 work with goes up dramatically because you've allowed people their own power :50 and you've allowed them to tell their story and then you're just inviting more people to obtain that power and :57 tell that story so so much of the Outreach I get is just terrible because :02 someone wants to tell me something that they don't know if I don't if I know it or not already I get all ones all the :10 time would you to make would you get to 20K a month and I'm I would have had to screw up a lot of stuff :15 right now to get to 20K a month I'd be going really far backwards but :21 that's what cold Outreach has become but a lot more I think a lot more demonstrating a lot more :28 showing and a lot less telling and a lot more force would get people a heck of a :34 lot further with greater people that are going to propel them ah heck of a lot further than they think they're even :40 capable of now yeah the word demonstration is what was coming to mind as you were Don't Sell, "Demonstrate" :47 discussing all of that demonstrating your content demonstrate in your ads demonstrate in your Outreach and you :52 don't have to sell it's just not I I'm not the first person to say this :58 but changing your your content from how

:34 lot further with greater people that are going to propel them ah heck of a lot further than they think they're even :40 capable of now yeah the word demonstration is what was coming to mind as you were Don't Sell, "Demonstrate" :47 discussing all of that demonstrating your content demonstrate in your ads demonstrate in your Outreach and you :52 don't have to sell it's just not I I'm not the first person to say this :58 but changing your your content from how how to to how I yeah or how Bob or how :06 Keaton or how Rob did this yeah will have a unbelievably profound effect for :13 a small change and the response that you get to that :18 communication yeah and those stories are it goes back to Sam ens :24 interviews back in the day those those were more valuable than the salonin course because I just got I was :31 oh they did this tiny thing at this moment and that I'm in that exact moment right now and the course was :37 helpful too but the the Epiphany Bridge even though it's not an epiphany Bridge :42 the epiphanies that come from the conversations and the the case studies are infinitely more powerful than just :50 the principles sometimes yeah yeah the :56 I would humbly say that people learn more from modeling me than what I teach :02 them yeah yeah you and anybody who's a parent will understand this :09 very either directly or instinctually that you are what you do and what you :16 are in front of your children much more than what you say to them get off that phone as you spend six hours on your :23 iPhone doesn't work yeah get off your phone when you're not on your phone and they can they can :31 observe that is is is the way to get that behavior in and it's the same with :38 clients treat them children is that the message okay sure let's go with :44 that it makes yeah it makes me think of multiple times in your community this year I'm I'm just excited to see :50 where he takes this I'm going to learn I'm going to learn by the start stuff he starts implementing the stuff :55 he stops implementing how he switches this around I can get on the calls I can go through the course and the workshops :01 but yeah the demonstration is oh that's cool I didn't think of that and :07 it sticks too it sticks more than the conversations we've had yeah :12 yeah I I just ran an experiment over the last three weeks in terms of an offer and next week I'll be :17 breaking that down about what really happened and what it what it looks and then there's still the :24 unknown piece about what that in an offer driven model what you want is for that offer to lead organically :31 and naturally to the next offer and so far that offer from the first offer to the second offer converts a 50% :38 and that's a big breakthrough right getting people to give you $300 and :44 50% of them giving you 3,000 within three weeks after that is a significant breakthrough but on the :50 surface people can copy the $300 and plenty of people have but the next level :56 is or how did that work and what happened behind behind the scenes and and what is the what are the :01 subjective things in that what people came through it and what are they doing and what are the problems and and what what they're learning so yeah the :08 model the modeling has multiple layers as well in terms of because a lot of people delude themselves that they have :14 perfect information they see that person doing that and they're going to funnel hack them and do that but they don't The 0-$100k Way :20 understand the outcomes Downstream and so modeling modeling is multi-stage and also has a lot of depth :25 to it as well okay I know you need to

problems and and what what they're learning so yeah the :08 model the modeling has multiple layers as well in terms of because a lot of people delude themselves that they have :14 perfect information they see that person doing that and they're going to funnel hack them and do that but they don't The 0-$100k Way :20 understand the outcomes Downstream and so modeling modeling is multi-stage and also has a lot of depth :25 to it as well okay I know you need to take the puppy to the beach so I'll I'll close with this question it's a big day :33 yeah big day expectations you alluded to this earlier that's it's the downfall of this :42 space because it's not about it's not about that the :47 results weren't good it's just that somebody was expecting something different most times because you told :53 that to them or you implied it through a maybe a testimonial or some other kind :59 of marketing that you're talking about however you still have this big Vision :05 you give your clients and that's the ideal that everyone's striving towards how is that different from go go from 0 :14 to 100K in X time frame and why do you do it that way the purple book got a :22 lot of people to escalate offers h to make big promises :28 and repeatedly over and over and over a decade of doing this thing :35 I found small promises with big vision would out sell and out deliver :43 and overd deliver on expectations much more than anything and so the the if you work hard on the big :51 Vision about what happens and what they become and you paint a Viv picture of the future then you're only saying that the small :57 promise that you're going to make is the first step on that Journey right and then together you'll work out :03 the terrain so for a lot of people for most people this is much more effective :10 than big promises because big promises are are just by definition harder to keep and there's more variables in them :16 but small promises are easier to deliver on easier to start and and and I found :23 easier to sell as well because if you use an example if you go :29 to since we're talking about orthodontist why not if you go to an orthodontic clinic that's getting you :36 know two leads a month and you say that I can get you 40 booked qualified appointments every single month :42 on autopilot without touching a single thing that experience doesn't feel close :49 to what they're doing now it feels it comes with a lot of baggage and a lot of stretch and lot more work and a lot :56 more stress right M but if you say you're at two Unbound leads two Unbound :02 leads a month and I'm going to get you to four that feels a positive First Step yeah and then ultimately :09 we're we're moving towards a state where you're doing you're getting this many inbound leads but you're only working :14 this time and then we can start to introduce different currencies so it's about understanding that a small promise :19 is easy to keep and easy to sell at the beginning and easy to deliver but it it's a small promise on a step into it L :25 of vision and what's your small promise I'll get you an offer that you can sell :30 with your thumbs on on a Google doc and if we if we do it to one person we can we can do it with a 100 got it and :37 then the big vision is the two hours or two days a week million dollars a year what does that mean to you where do you :43 want to go with it Etc let's let's get some results together first let's let's put an offer together that :49 you can sell in ways that that are effortless to you compared to maybe what you've and how you've done it :54

do it to one person we can we can do it with a 100 got it and :37 then the big vision is the two hours or two days a week million dollars a year what does that mean to you where do you :43 want to go with it Etc let's let's get some results together first let's let's put an offer together that :49 you can sell in ways that that are effortless to you compared to maybe what you've and how you've done it :54 before if we get one if we get one is their belief that we can get two 10 and :00 and 100 yeah it's your your weekly pricing thing which is just lower the :06 now number instead of a th a month it's 250 a week so people can get in but it's the same with believability lower :13 than now believability do you think we could have an offer that you're ready to sell next week yeah that's believable :20 it's what I want versus Pie in the Sky guarantee 100K a month in two :27 months and nobody hits it because they didn't do the 12 things every single day on the :35 guarantee the title is old as time do you yeah do you get people asking :41 because I struggled with this when I I defined the big Vision which for me was it was 200k a year :48 you're working 20 hours a week on your agency and you're taking home 200k :53 a year and I would get a lot of people being well who how many people have :59 done that and is that something how do you do it what's :04 the model they're they're so they get fixated on this Vision as if :09 it's the gospel truth when really it's just look if it's 150 for you not :15 200 that's fine do you get that thing and and if so what do you say to it I I don't I don't get it at all but I :22 have a I have a distinct advantage that I am my own case :29 study so if I put my own mask on First and do fun things with fun people and :34 make lots of money I just say to people do you want something this or your :40 version of it and they go okay and if you don't have that Advantage which is :46 extremely meta do what you teach and teach what you do then you only need one example I've I've seen :55 plenty of cases where someone's just got one ideal case study that they leverage :00 to get a hundred more of those people as the ideal case study so the magical number in these in the in the course of :06 demonstration is usually one right because one leads to two yeah and if you :11 can demonstrate that you can that you can do it once and you can demonstrate :17 you understand the principle success in that and the Strategic level of mechanisms and the vision level of of :25 identity that you that you paint a picture of then you will have more results and more case studies than you :31 can shake a stick out but it it all started with one and I've :37 got rich by getting other people Rich right yeah it's it's it's and the more I :44 I work to that ideal and and then layer enjoyment over the top of it then the :50 better it all works for everybody very cool okay okay so you have a book More of James's Secret :56 tell everybody where they can find the book and then we'll end this thing The Sovereign consultant

 This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings. ## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles **Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened? Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them. Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week. Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed. Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days. It's sexy to the right person. Helping people get their first 500 or next 500. Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event. If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter. Small promises are easy to keep. Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this? A community connects them. You're building a network. What's in it for them? The first sale is to yourself. Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes. Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase? If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific. Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution? The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community. Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle. What happens? We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan. You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing. What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance. Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers. Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: 
> "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."

Guy: My offer is for project managers: 6-figure role, reduced stress. Is that enough to differentiate? Most people would take a little bit more stress for more money. Focus on the 6-figure PM job. Reduced stress is the next problem to solve. Every solution creates another problem. Ahmed: My community offer value drops after 4-5 months. Should I switch to a one-time payment and smaller weekly fee? Pricing is a proxy for value. Why don't you deliver more value? We have weekly trainings. I could teach more, but I'm running out of things to teach. Most businesses have the fundamentals. Bad businesses look for the new piece. Repackage the fundamentals. Give them old value in new ways. Maximize value, maintain/increase price. Khan: I'm launching a community offer in English: $50/week for calls and community, $150/week for implementation, $250/week for WhatsApp, $750/week for one-on-one. Too complicated? Launch the middle two tiers in a hybrid: $100 and $250. The $100 is an easy start point, the $250 allows for higher-level access. More creates confusion. Treat free members as leads. This is the founding offer. Stefan: I'm working on an offer for customer experience optimization. How do I get specific on the goal when outcomes are different? You choose the playground. The sovereign community offer ($3k to $3k/week) isn't relevant for a $13M/year client. Who's your first customer? A medical supplies business with high turnover, low staff, no digital expert. Currency can be time and energy. Installing one system saves 10 hours/week. What do they want? Demand and money are unlimited. What's the intersection? Sell to the demand that's already there. Adam: How many benefits can be added? All of them, but lead with the core. What if tier one is live a better life, tier two is making money? Too confusing. Tier two is faster, more access. How to get paid in full? Both ways work. For large discounts, don't mention it in the doc. For bonuses, pre-sell it. The $100/week is a strong enough lead. Put offer hypotheses in the community for feedback. Specificity is key. Train yourself to be specific, and it carries over to all communication. Things people can point at are footholds on your content. ## Workshops as a Client Acquisition Strategy **Summary:** This segment focuses on using workshops as a powerful tool for acquiring clients. James emphasizes creating workshops that deliver real value, focusing on client needs, and strategically making offers within the workshop context. Video Source:* 100Dollar Offers.txt **Content:** So when I am starting to think about a workshop, I'm always looking at what clients want. The reason I'm holding a workshop about workshops is that the market is in a low-trust place, and workshops are effective for building trust. The market has become cynical, and workshops are an antidote because they allow you to demonstrate value. Once we've got a concept of what clients need, we turn it into an offer. I make the distinction between products and offers. Products are something we do, an offer is something people engage with. So I package it up in a way that is attractive. $100 is a nice price point. Workshops are challenging if you're doing something brand new. They're not necessarily a place to test concepts, but they are a place to reframe, reiterate, reteach, and remind clients. We have fatigue, life gets in the way, people get off track. The best workshops reiterate, reteach, and remind, giving them a new frame. You need people to do shit. The people who do stuff for you are sick to death of being fat

. Workshops are challenging if you're doing something brand new. They're not necessarily a place to test concepts, but they are a place to reframe, reiterate, reteach, and remind clients. We have fatigue, life gets in the way, people get off track. The best workshops reiterate, reteach, and remind, giving them a new frame. You need people to do shit. The people who do stuff for you are sick to death of being fat. No more convincing will get them to that point apart from being utterly fed up. People buy stuff to make feelings go away. Show them what works in the workshop, give them the blueprint. Package it into a solution, the 7-day fasting solution. After 7 days, if they want to become a client, credit their workshop investment. Focus on people who are ready. People don't wake up ready because of an email. They wake up sick of feeling a certain way. Nurturing and educating doesn't move the needle. I try and say the same thing 10 different ways. The workshop frame is self-contained. They give everyone a result. The worst mistake is holding a workshop just to get customers. The more you try and manipulate, the worse it does. It's tempting to leave out pieces, but that's a huge mistake. You're under-delivering. I sold over a thousand $100 tickets and over 500 at other price points last year. 100% refund guarantee, and we did 5. A workshop is self-contained, has everything needed inside it. The approach is trust. The best clients understand the value of proximity and insight. They get the information and decide they want to be closer. Most people are fine with information. The majority will do nothing. Some will try. Some will see it work and come back. Some will think it's harder than it looked and need help. If you measure workshops only on conversion rate, you are back to marketing, and most people suck at marketing. A workshop is self-contained, gives everyone a result, and trust happens after. Are you ready? If you are, show up. I've got the safest way. Don't use the word "proven." The longer I go at this, the less prepared I am to convince. Here's an offer. Here's another. You stop where you want. People make themselves ready. Marketers have indoctrinated people to believe they can change minds, but that's mixing cause and effect. It's offers for people who are ready. Take your marketing hat off, you're not there to sell. Focus on giving them the result. One of the greatest gifts is a lack of anxiety. Aggressively marketing comes across as anxious. I come across I don't give a fuck. You're gonna do you, I'm gonna do me. The duality of good workshops is the more you create for clients, the more sales you make to customers best for clients. I want to work with people that understand the value of proximity. Results come from osmosis. Information is everywhere. The less sales I try to make, the more sales I make. I focus on client delivery. Flipping the script: a workshop sells tickets, delivers to clients, and generates clients. Two frames: part of client delivery ("This is a workshop for our members") and a small part of something larger. Show how it fits in the big picture. The people I had to do the most salesmanship with were the worst clients. All the desire exists. Just make offers. Don't spend time on a 42-step email sequence. They came to the conclusion themselves. If you give them too much, they'll go somewhere simpler. If you mismatch the energy, they'll think you just want their money. Don't be a marketer. Alexandra: I'm a marketer trying to get out of marketing. I run webinars for professional services businesses

Identify the time, who will use it, and give them the process. They have to do some labor. Otherwise, they buy courses. They don't buy group programs because they're not time efficient. They buy things one step away from done-for-you, but more economically viable. Alex is good at setting up Zoom and pixels. The sovereign blueprint is built on principles: 2 days a week, dinner with kids, nothing scheduled Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays. Coaching is helping people discover the answer inside them. Consulting is giving someone the answer. Mentorship is showing someone how I would do it. A creator conjures original ideas, a curator assembles the best ideas. If I do these things, this is how they come into fruition: share content, grow leads, create workshops, sell tickets, make it easy to get started, maximize client experience and LTV, build a client base, find those who value coaching. Hierarchy: maximum 24 people in the circle at $750/week, maximum 100 in the syndicate at $250/week, no maximum for membership. Many people intend to work with you. The key is making offers that get people to commit. Maybes kill progress. Offer-driven businesses don't get maybes. The strongest intent is purchasing. Understand their intent. When someone buys a $9 ticket, did they do it to get what was in the workshop, to run workshops, or because they're fed up? Most won't buy your coaching. The most efficient business has a range of offers. The sovereign blueprint: 2 days a week, $1M net/year, run on my own. Because workshops are one component of the sovereign blueprint. The judgment of a workshop is understood by looking at the marketplace. Most people won't buy. Most won't become clients. Most marketing filters through a thousand to find one unicorn client. The realities of market dynamics: not everyone will buy your stuff. Leverage is identifying who is likely to buy, who will buy regularly, and who would find further access useful. Customers are one-off transactions, clients are allocated time, energy, and resources. What people say and what people do are different. The key to an efficient business is making offers that get people to commit. Maybes kill progress. Offer-driven businesses don't get maybes. Purchasing demonstrates intent. Understand their intent. Most of the market won't buy your coaching. I operate within the power laws. Only so many will pay over $3k/month, and I can only coach so many effectively. I can mentor more, and information is infinitely scalable. I work backwards from what clients need. I sell workshop tickets by defining what my circle needs. I create for clients, give them proximity and access, insight and some access, and information. I turn creations into products, create customers, and invite them to become clients. I've got a call as an option. Create workshops for clients, sell tickets to customers. Pricing isn't irrelevant, but relatively unimportant. Any purchase is a trust signal. Purchasing has friction. Four types of offers: money offers and live a better life offers. $100 workshops work for money offers, $25-$50 for live a better life offers. Pricing is a dial for volume. The best thing about a workshop is it's a singular component. I produce a Google Doc and go live. To dial up clients, add a bonus call. Solve a single problem, deliver a single result. Sell them what they want, give them what they need. I trick my clients into coming by making it sound more fun. I'm a big proponent of selling the next thing, making it sound great, but delivering what they need. Magic pills sell. Frame it magically while staying ethical. If you're experienced, you can take more risks testing new ideas. I believe people's time is precious

. Solve a single problem, deliver a single result. Sell them what they want, give them what they need. I trick my clients into coming by making it sound more fun. I'm a big proponent of selling the next thing, making it sound great, but delivering what they need. Magic pills sell. Frame it magically while staying ethical. If you're experienced, you can take more risks testing new ideas. I believe people's time is precious. Repurposing something you're confident about and giving it a new frame is the best way to deliver. I've delivered workshops about workshops 3 times. I find new things, so I reteach. Remember they're a small sum of the larger part. I can't help you build a sovereign business in this workshop. There's a bigger piece. Three types of workshops: demonstration (show what's working, give them the things that work), model (show the overall model, give them a plan), and mechanism (help them use the mechanism to get a result). Demonstration: show what's working, why it works, give them the things that work, and let them replicate. I want people to copy me. Model: show the overall model, give them a plan, help them envisage theirs. Mechanism: help them use the mechanism to get a result. Traffic to your sales page is warm. You don't need long sales pages. Short, punchy, bullet-pointed pages work best. The more you give to sell, the more objections. Put logistical details on the sales page. Content pre-sells the sales page. 3-7 day promotion periods work well. Most people run out of things to say before 7 days. Content builds context. By the time they get to the sales page, they're sold on the context. Your workshop depends on your delivery method. Some do slides, workbooks, docs, straight to camera. I docs because they help me think. Delivery has two parts: the vehicle (document, slides) and the conversation (Q&A). Insight can happen during or after. The replay goes into the community. If they don't join, they get it on an ungated page. Ungated means it's pirated, but it works in your favor long-term. How do you get clients? The key metric is the number of offers you make. Insert the offer briefly but carefully. Client offers convert better when offered to customers. Workshops convert better than webinars. It's easier to sell to someone who's bought before. Five touch points: 24 hours and 60 minutes before, beginning, end, and replay. If you offer a call, that's a fifth touch point. The more offers you make, the more clients you get. Three common mistakes: building a workshop a webinar, building a workshop to sell (leaving pieces out), and creating workshops when desperate for clients. Even if you don't have clients, run a workshop for an imaginary client. Focus on delivery. Results are created long-term. Good results come from giving good insights, teaching, and experiences. If you focus on delivery, then have a system to distribute it, you'll get the best results. Your marketing becomes demonstration and distribution. Most people spend 80% of their time marketing, 20% delivering. I spend 80% creating for clients, 20% productizing and monetizing. I work backwards from what clients need. There's a paradox with workshops: some of the best for clients are the worst for customers. Think about turning workshops into long-term assets the same way you think about ads. Run 10 workshops to find the one that works long-term. Judge them on three dimensions: product, delivery, and client generation. What are you focusing on? Client acquisition? Run spicy workshops that give immediate results. When upselling, send reminders 24 hours and 60 minutes before

Run spicy workshops that give immediate results. When upselling, send reminders 24 hours and 60 minutes before. Deadlines are the most ethical scarcity. If you're doing things live, you have natural scarcity. Scarcity is interesting. If you impose it, it's not real. If you constrain yourself, it works. People choose round numbers 10. What about 3? Set yourself up to win. Winning is not losing. I put constraints on things that allow me to win by default. If you're in the season of wanting to push people, you might want short, intense volume. But as soon as you try and create scarcity, you're back to manipulation. Weekly workshops run out quick unless there's an anchor workshop repeated every second week. If going weekly, repeat something 50% of the time. If you open all workshops to clients, respect their time. With ads, you need instant gratification. Show-up rates plummet the further out you book. Run the previous workshop as a product, then have the live workshop periodically. Every quarter, I have a customers-only workshop. Selling multiple workshops together? What are you trying to do? Increase client quality? Churn reduction and retention is difficult to sell because it's invisible. Craft products that show where they start and where they go. How to double your $5k/month coaching business in 30 days. Growth is getting more clients, keeping clients longer, getting clients to pay more. Workshops are an antidote to expensive lead generation and long conversion cycles. Frame the workshop as exactly what clients need. Once you help people see power laws in their client base, they can double or triple their revenue from a single source. Making a workshop tangible in the personal development space? The root of every thought is a feeling. All feelings lead to thoughts lead to actions. Make it physically present, point out where and when it happens. People don't buy abstract things. They want to wake up without dread. Bring tangibility by making them physically present. Everything has a place. Tangibility of feelings has a place. Future pacing is pointing at things that will happen in the future. The more immediate, the more tangible. Personal development should focus on mechanisms. Get them out of their head. Get them to do something tangible. Even if it's brilliant, most won't do anything with it. Be a little less depressed every day. Change sells transformation. Bring them down to something to point at right now. How to generate content for email sequences? I look at things and go, "That's interesting!" I draw a vague line between the content and the offer. Boston challenge workshop or web class? What's the distinction? The web class shows them how, the workshop teaches. What do you want? Clients. $27 for the workshop, then invite them to become a client. Don't run a web class. What would it do that the workshop doesn't? This is marketing, more information. Focus on people who are ready. I've got the healthiest way for those who are ready. Don't use the word "proven." I'm less prepared to convince. Here's an offer. People make themselves ready. Marketers think they can change minds, but it's offers for people who are ready. Take your marketing hat off. Focus on the result. Give them a lack of anxiety. Aggressively marketing is anxious. I come across I don't give a fuck. You're going to do you, I'm going to do me. The more you create for clients, the more sales you make

# New Transcripts James - Part 1

James Kemp: so the install offer the offer install. James Kemp: Here's the doc. James Kemp: If this is your 1st time with us, and you're a guest. Welcome if this is your 1st time with us as a member. Welcome! James Kemp: How these work is! I show you something James Kemp: and talk about why it works and talk about how it works. And then we've got some time to get it to work for you. So there's always a supporting document with these, usually a template. James Kemp: So the supporting dockers and the in the chat. James Kemp: and there's also a template that we'll get to soon. James Kemp: So the install offer this one's pretty cool because it is James Kemp: the highest converting offer I've run for 7 years in terms of how I've deployed it, and also James Kemp: the James Kemp: when I've passed it on to clients. I've seen a very, very fast conversion when this is deployed as well, and it's cool, because it's simple James Kemp: and it goes wrong when it's not simple and it's over complicated. James Kemp: So the the running of an offer driven business James Kemp: is the most efficient route to scale, because James Kemp: when you make offers, and when your prospects receive offers, you create some motion James Kemp: right? And even if the offers aren't working. James Kemp: You still create motion because you create motion for both yourself and your clients, and James Kemp: that puts you in the game. And James Kemp: most of business is not thriving and becoming a billionaire and making this and making that. It's surviving until that opportunity comes along that, creates the outsized returns. If you are not making and delivering on offers frequently, then you are not getting paid or creating results. Frequently James Kemp: it is that simple. If you aren't making offers, you aren't serving people. And in the process of serving people we improve our craft, acquire more skills. We get them results. We create compound effects across the board. James Kemp: If we are not making on deliver and delivering on offers, we are not delivering some level of change in ourselves or other people. We're not delivering some level of transformation in ourselves or other people. We're not really going anywhere. James Kemp: The reason I get paid every day is not because I make offers every day is because I help other people every day, and in the course of that I make offers right? So it's this big, positive circular loop. James Kemp: But what type of offers when how James Kemp: matters to it dictates what results we get, because all offers aren't created equal. All clients aren't created equal. James Kemp: And when I talk about an offer. I'm just making the distinction between a product and offer. James Kemp:, a product is something that we do and deliver on. James Kemp: and that we and and the offer is the wrapper that we put around it, that someone interacts with. James Kemp: that. The offer is the wrapper that we put around something or or a collection of products that someone interacts with interacts with in the sense of, we get their attention for it. And then ultimately, when we have an offer, we promise a result or proximity to a result around it. James Kemp: and we use different offers for different purposes. James Kemp: and discernment and sequencing is required for you relative to where you are right now. James Kemp: So here's 4 types of offer. James Kemp: We have a customer offer that purely creates a buyer James Kemp: that is usually a singular product in that offer it creates a. It creates a buyer, and then we can discern what that buyer needs next, and then turn them into a customer who make the custom of buying

. James Kemp: and discernment and sequencing is required for you relative to where you are right now. James Kemp: So here's 4 types of offer. James Kemp: We have a customer offer that purely creates a buyer James Kemp: that is usually a singular product in that offer it creates a. It creates a buyer, and then we can discern what that buyer needs next, and then turn them into a customer who make the custom of buying. James Kemp: We use that to create cash flow. We create qualified buyers. . I talk a lot about intent. If someone invests in something. Then, no matter the dollar figure, we should be curious about why they invested in that thing at that particular time, for why they're trying to solve. Because then we can ask the magic question, do you want some help with that? James Kemp: So a growth offer is committing to a path James Kemp: of progress over a medium to long term period, and it provides recurring revenue. James Kemp: A transformation offer James Kemp: is that's creating a change that is exceptional relative to the average. So this tends to be coaching, or or a long term coaching engagement. It creates a high margin product, and it creates recurrent revenue. James Kemp: An acquisition offer is a binary offer., people, it's easy for someone to say yes or no to that solves the pressing problem that in the marketplace or solves the pressing problem that you can solve, for James Kemp: that provides clients, and it provides momentum because it's the the faster you can acquire a client, deliver to them and then find the next problem to solve the faster you're in momentum and also require it also creates cash flow. James Kemp: An install offer is an acquisition offer. James Kemp: It is a relatively short duration engagement that solves a specific problem. James Kemp: and that is a very easy offer to say yes or no to for a client. And it's also a very easy offer for you to make in the marketplace, because it's focused and specific. James Kemp: So when we look at the the the matrix of what we have then, ideally. James Kemp: we have an install offer that sits on the front end of our growth offer. James Kemp: So I'll use an example to illustrate that. Better James Kemp: the offer install which is my install offer, which is, there's a lot of tautology, and mixing up the order of words here because I do what I teach and teach what I do. James Kemp: The the offer installers the 1st 13 weeks of the syndicate with a couple of little sprinkle add-ons that what that means is my delivery can be maintained the same. James Kemp: I on board someone. I get on a call with them. I set a direction. They get access to the group calls and a direction on training and feedback. And then that continuum that gives me the opportunity to sell to someone over a short duration period without promising or talking about a 12 month. Transformation allows them to get started, and then also allows us to have a conversation after 13 weeks of whether they want to stay in that engagement. James Kemp: And approximately 80% of people do stay past that 13 weeks. James Kemp: So the install offer and an acquisition offer has a dual purpose. It it allows us to get customer clients quickly, but it also allows us to bring clients into our world and have the opportunity to keep them over the long term when it's part of a when it's part of a pathway and it and it syncs up with the offer behind it. James Kemp: and it's optimal to have a growth offer that a client can continue with at the conclusion. But it's not essential if you just want clients. Now, when you want to get started and and you want to get rolling anything. Making the offer is the most important thing

. James Kemp: and it's optimal to have a growth offer that a client can continue with at the conclusion. But it's not essential if you just want clients. Now, when you want to get started and and you want to get rolling anything. Making the offer is the most important thing. James Kemp: the James Kemp: one mindset that is very useful to inhabit in the world of help. Whether you're a consultant, a mentor, a coach, or a service provider. James Kemp: is that the offer and the promise you're about to make already exist in the marketplace. In some form, right? James Kemp: Desire is everywhere. James Kemp: People want things that they don't have right now all over the shop. James Kemp: Right? Problems are everywhere. James Kemp: People want stuff to go away and be solved for all over the place, and more desire, and more problems are created than solutions. every single day. James Kemp: so opportunity is bottomless, and the central key to speed of conversion James Kemp: is turning existing desire into immediate demand. James Kemp: If you watch the the call that I had with Lana earlier in the week, we talk about what's already present in the marketplace. James Kemp: What's already? What's already happening? What do people want right now and then? We're just looking for something that meets that existing desire, and that demand. James Kemp: and the more pressing the problem. James Kemp: the more acute and immediate. That demand will be James Kemp: right if you turned up. If someone had got their leg chopped off. And you said, Do you want me to stop the bleeding? You don't need to send them a Google Doc and put them on a 45 min call to put them through a sales process to get. Forget them to say yes, please. I'd you to stop the bleeding right and and metaphorically, there are people in your that match. The skill set that you've got out in the marketplace, bleeding or pining for things that they don't currently have. James Kemp: So it sounds so trite and overly simple. James Kemp: We sell things that people want and especially in James Kemp: the coaching and consulting and expert market. James Kemp: Most people have a really difficult time of getting out of the way of the of ideals, and you hear this in language . James Kemp: they need to have this, and they should have this, and they must want this, which are projections out into a marketplace James Kemp: of James Kemp: knowledge that you possess, that the market doesn't yet possess. Oh, you need you. You should have a Crm. And you're dude. I've got 5 clients, I can, name them, and I know their birthdays. But, to a Crm expert you need a Crm, because that's just what happens. That's what you need to organize things. They don't. They need something right now, and offers that offers that work meet that James Kemp: meet that market right there. James Kemp: The 2 central killers of offers that people don't want the thing that you're selling. James Kemp: Coaches are notorious for making things for themselves, and then thinking that everybody else should want it. James Kemp: And it's not clear what outcome they get. James Kemp: So we simply solve for this. And this is a requirement of much as a surrender requirement rather than a force requirement. We solve for this by having a hypothesis developed from real world data or experience. And that is, people are already buying this off someone else. That is a positive market signal they've asked. They've asked you for it before. That is a positive market signal

We solve for this by having a hypothesis developed from real world data or experience. And that is, people are already buying this off someone else. That is a positive market signal they've asked. They've asked you for it before. That is a positive market signal. James Kemp: and more commonly, it's a thing you're already delivering to clients, and it unfolds in the process that that's a particular thing that clients love or or clients want. James Kemp: and we solve for clarity by promising one clear outcome over one time period. James Kemp: The further we get away and the more dimensions we get away from these these simple truths, the lower the chance of velocity and outcomes. James Kemp: And again, I'm going to beat up on pretty much everybody. James Kemp: just because you want something doesn't mean the market wants it. James Kemp: and we must understand what the market wants to to meet the market where they are. James Kemp: I think it was a Dan Kennedyism, but, into the conversation, and that's already happening in their head. Right? And and all desire and problems are already out in the marketplace. And we just need to turn that into demand with an offer. James Kemp: and we do that through a simple equation. James Kemp: So we have a specific outcome James Kemp: over a specific timeframe. And then we convert James Kemp: specific outcome is either very easy to point at, very prescriptive and specific and objective, and a specific timeframe is that. How long will that take, or how long are we going to engage together. James Kemp: When a prospect clearly see what happens in the future, they can make a clear, buying decision. James Kemp: It's important to understand in the world of services. The thing that we're selling doesn't exist right James Kemp: in physical products. When you go and buy a car and you're going into the showroom and someone points at the car. And you're, I want that one. But it's black James Kemp: that has a physicality in existence James Kemp: which is tangible, right? We sell things that don't exist yet, because the future hasn't happened yet. So the clearer the picture that we insert in someone's mind of what is going to happen in the future, the more tangible our offer becomes, and the more tangible our offer is, the more viable because it fundamentally feels real right. James Kemp: So as with any equation James Kemp: the the defined inputs create the defined outputs. The smaller the promise, the more easy it is to keep and the more specificity we have around what gets done, and over what time period, the higher the conversion. James Kemp: the further again, the further we get away from that, the slower it is, and the harder it is to sell and the less quality of the data that we get. James Kemp: So here is my install offer called the offer install. It's not confusing whatsoever. James Kemp: This is the reason these work as well is because they're very, very short and we had this conversation in the syndicate Michael, who's a, one of the best salespeople and and sales trainers in the world, talking about the mindset of offers and a huge, a huge component that we're talking about on Tuesday was. James Kemp: things that are easy to say no to right and specific offers are easy to say no to, because they're not relevant for that particular person. James Kemp: Your offer should be as easy to say No as as it is to say yes to, because the right person says yes, and also the right person says no

. James Kemp: things that are easy to say no to right and specific offers are easy to say no to, because they're not relevant for that particular person. James Kemp: Your offer should be as easy to say No as as it is to say yes to, because the right person says yes, and also the right person says no. James Kemp: So I'll go through line by line about what works. So obviously, we've got the headline. James Kemp: We? We do limited openings. So we want a high velocity offer ecosystem. So we offer less than we can possibly supply. James Kemp: If you can service 10 people right. Now, then, opening it up for 4 means that you offer less supply to the market than you're prepared to fulfill, and you aim to generate more demand than supply. James Kemp: I say it every week, but the way to run a low stress business is having much more demand than supply, and the way to have high demand and low supply is meter. The supply and release it, and stagger, stagger its release, but also generate as much demand as possible. So you'll always you've always got an overflow. That means you're never chasing people. You're never wondering where the next clients come from, because largely people have missed out on your last offer. James Kemp: So I to start with a qualifier. James Kemp: the the common qualifier, and the market for help. The market for coaching or consulting is, people have gone through something, and they have gone into a program. And it wasn't very good, or they didn't get high levels of access, or they didn't get the specific outcome. And they left feeling James Kemp: all I was told to do was watch lots of videos and go on a Facebook group and maybe turn up to some calls once in a while. Right? So I specifically call out the people who already have the solution awareness. James Kemp: what you need is a high, converting offer for your audience. Right? It's baked in about the about the requirements that we have. James Kemp: They believe the solution to their lack of sales is high converting offer, and they have an audience. James Kemp: What they don't want to do is watch hundreds of videos get more generic advice. Put your prices up, etc. They want specific help and targeting right? And then I put the this is what I do. This is what I do. James Kemp: This is what I do every day. I do it for myself, and this is what's going to get done. So this is how we partner together, we combine your delivery and audience with my offer creation skills. James Kemp: This is what it is. This is me, you and some Google Docs and some zoom time. Right? So I've created the specific credit, the specific environment that we got to operate under. And then I'm really clear about what it is. James Kemp: or the central piece that people are buying? Is this everything else around it? All the access they get to trainings, all the access they get to a group. And all those things their benefits. They're not core propositions of the offer. James Kemp: Our goal is at least 10 k. In new revenue. Here's some examples of what happens when people do this. These are not typical. There is no cap with the right offer for your audience, which is true, because I've engaged with someone here, and the offer made over a million dollars twice., so, there is no upper limit. But the promise is very manageable and very measurable for someone who's got, just some basic things that I can work with. James Kemp: you understand? Over 12 weeks we install in cash flow one client offer generating at least 10 K. In sales. James Kemp: Right? It's binary

., so, there is no upper limit. But the promise is very manageable and very measurable for someone who's got, just some basic things that I can work with. James Kemp: you understand? Over 12 weeks we install in cash flow one client offer generating at least 10 K. In sales. James Kemp: Right? It's binary. James Kemp: If you don't want that James Kemp: right fine, it's you don't need that right now. You don't benefit from it. You don't see the benefit from it, etc. James Kemp: It is easy to say no to not either. That's not my priority right now. I need more leads or no., I'm already at 7 figures, and 10 K, is my coffee bill for next month. Right? So it's it's it's it's right in the pocket of relevance of someone who's a good fit for me and the syndicate, who's probably at between 10 and 30 KA month, who's looking to reorganize things and make them more stable and more efficient. James Kemp: And then I go into a little bit of why offers are important, and then we unpack, and we future pace what happens. James Kemp: So get clear on your ideal market and co-create a client, offer to get some results within the minimum of you. James Kemp: We use a hybrid office, or I insert a mechanism into there and then, in phase 2. I explain what cash flowing is. Right. So we cash flow the offer and work to tap on these new clients. I'll leave you with an offering system that you can run every single month James Kemp: with. I'll talk about ascension and pricing, and how we do it in a moment. If someone buys this and they stay with me for 13 weeks and they go off happy. Then I'm happy if someone buys this, and they stay with me for 13 weeks, and they stay in the syndicate and then stay with me forever. I'm happy. The result delivers. James Kemp: no matter what. There is not holding anything back from the future. The offer is the offer, and it's designed to get the result James Kemp: right, and then again reiterate that. So what we do together, I reiterate what gets done, how it works. So I front load the delivery of these. So we get on a 1 to one call. We do the offer. There's probably a small amount of homework for the people to go for the person to go away with, and then I drop them into the infrastructure I've already got. So that person gets access to the syndicate calls, gets access to the trainings, etc. James Kemp: So again, that's a benefit. James Kemp: That's not the core proposition of the offer. But once they're in, as with, people are coming to the syndicate calls and says, Well, I want to stick around. I this group, etc, etc. Then they go James Kemp: the investment I'll talk about. I use pay as you profit in a few different ways. I'll talk about this in more detail in a moment. But. James Kemp: this James Kemp: template covers. I don't use this pricing right now. But this one is 5 K. Now 5 K. When we hit 10 k. Of sales. James Kemp: and I put the pay plan secondary. So I'll let you finance the initial 5 K. Over 12 weeks at 500 per week. James Kemp: Then I have a qualifier. You're probably doing these things. You're probably dissatisfied with this. You have these things right? James Kemp: And we are more defined. James Kemp: What about who we don't work with and who we do
