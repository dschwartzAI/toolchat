# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 4

you can't go straight from broke to meaning you have to make money right you can't be trying to pay the bills and also trying to impact the world it doesn't work you have to so anyway all that it say things happen in sequence so if we're talking about the foundational things and let's talk about someone's first offer yeah because either they're at 10K a month and they only have one offer and it sucks and it's not scalable or it's not attractive or you're at 50k a month and you've been in the game for a while and you've got 17 offers if someone was to come to you and they're going I want to get to 100K a month in a way that's profitable in a way that scales in a way that I but that clients get results all those things what would be that main offer because it might be we can get into the multiple offers you might have an offer stack or a hybrid offer to get to 100K month but what would be that main offer that you would encourage the average person to build out to lay that Foundation to build a seven figure business so the average person everyone needs momentum but the average person needs momentum the most and the thing that gets the most momentum in an offer is around the refining the promise or refining what gets done what's the outcome of going to be that so if you're if you're selling money which is getting someone to 100K a month Etc you need to say that's our goal and that's what we're going to do M if you're selling time then or you're selling better life then you need to be exquisitly clear about how you articulate what the outcome is on the other side because as soon as you can inject the frame of what's going to happen when that person with that person over the next weeks months maybe year then your offer becomes a lot easier to buy because I think we've both said this recently most people have enough leads if you're at if you're at 10K a month you have enough leads to get to 30k a month you just need a refinement around the promise and what you're doing and in many cases it's refining it down to something making small promises that are much easier to keep rather than making bigger and having promise inflation so I always look around what gets done here in the offer what what are they what are they promising you know and metaphorically in terms of sometimes the literal promise I will get you there we can talk about guarantees but I will get you there and this is where we're going and refining that round so it's much more clear so they they see a bump in conversions because most people have enough leads and if you get the promise right then those leads are more likely to convert and it's much more binary well the promise is interesting because I think people often think that the promise is the deliverables right and Promise vs Guarantee they conflate it with a guarantee which is not the same thing of course so my first coaching offer was 1 hour a week for I don't even think I had a minimum I think it was just 1 hour a week and this is the monthly price and it was if anyone interested it was 600 us a month so it was $150 per hour and that was up from the $13 an hour I was getting paid I was I'm rich right but I had no promise I was just we will meet every week for an hour and I will teach you these things and I didn't even have a lovely system it was more oh you're a real estate agent I'll help you get more listings but again the emphasis was on the deliverables and so the best I would argue you did have a promise and my and my lexicon of promises because you you were promising time and attention in a in a predictable amount you were say I will spend an hour a week with you right right so that's a promise yeah of course it's it's not a promise

these things and I didn't even have a lovely system it was more oh you're a real estate agent I'll help you get more listings but again the emphasis was on the deliverables and so the best I would argue you did have a promise and my and my lexicon of promises because you you were promising time and attention in a in a predictable amount you were say I will spend an hour a week with you right right so that's a promise yeah of course it's it's not a promise to say I'll spend an hour hour a week with you and you're going to be a millionaire by next January but the promise is is largely defined on what they get and that's why one-on-one coaching is easier to sell than group coaching because the promise is more easier to Define I will spend time with you yeah so it's more easier to ATT so so help me understand for a second when Dream Outcome you say promise you talking about dream outcome or you talking about the commitment you're making to someone the commitment you're making to someone okay got you I was more thinking coming up from dream outcome that totally makes sense cuz the best metap for I've heard around that is the you don't sound the play trip you sound the destination and as Elementary as that sounds that help helps you sell $1000 programs and $100,000 Consulting deals right and so when you think about that dream outcome aspect how should people be thinking about it whether it's weight loss whether it's anxiety whether it's money whether it's productivity when people are trying to figure out okay whether it's group or oneto one and we'll get to the details in a second yeah what are some of the key things that you think people should be considering when it comes to a dream outcome let's say they're going to sell a 90day 16 weeks not a yearlong not a multi-year thing not a onh hour Consulting deal but a 3 to four month thing what should they be thinking about when it comes to dream outcomes believability because what an underrated or misunderstood thing in the the high ticket space is a lot of people are trying to convey the authority and the confidence in the person who's delivering it whereas in many cases you need to raise the confidence of the buyer much more than you need to raise the confidence of the seller to deliver the result right so smaller smaller promises are easier to keep and that's theistic I always use with clients of many cases I've seen offers triple in conversion by reducing down the the reduce down the number they go from we'll get you 100 qualified calls a month to we'll get you 10 because that the person on the other side of it the 10 is much more relative to where they are now when they're only getting two right so 100 was the thing that didn't convert because it seems it's in Disneyland where it 10 feel something achievable that's a great example because I get cold DM every day and they're we'll get you20 seems to be the new number do you do the numbers on these if you do sh rate close rate we sell a $5,000 you're helping me get to 500,000 a month for $250 a call or some stupid thing but but this is a great point because the first time I ever realized this I had a client called Brian Mark the fitness guy The Promise amazing human in a SE of helping people get to 10K a month that was the promise of all his contemporaries his promise was you're a personal trainer I will help you make $2 to $5,000 a month as an online fitness coach it worked to the tune of a thousand clients for him paying him I think it was $300 $400 month it was a huge lesson for me because 10K it sounds the more obvious thing whatever the bigger numberers if you can confidently say we're going to get you there then surely the bigger numbers I think it's going to help you make more sales but

his promise was you're a personal trainer I will help you make $2 to $5,000 a month as an online fitness coach it worked to the tune of a thousand clients for him paying him I think it was $300 $400 month it was a huge lesson for me because 10K it sounds the more obvious thing whatever the bigger numberers if you can confidently say we're going to get you there then surely the bigger numbers I think it's going to help you make more sales but he was working with people that primarily made $800 to $1,500 a month selling their time burnt out and what he was selling them was the dream of more money in many cases it was doubling or tripling what they were making but they could have the freedom of making the money in their own way on their own time and it crushed and that was where I was this was maybe 3 years ago I was I don't know if I understand this promise thing as as well as I should yeah yeah it's the people think the promise is relative to their skills but it's relative to the market that you're in right it's relative to where the people are similar David and Craig who coached in person personal trainers in the UK again they tested all the all the different types of messaging 10 grand a month for and when when you're at Â£1,000 a month as your take home income 10,000 is it's on another planet you're in their head they need to become fundamentally a different person and that's terrifying yeah four to five I can see how that happens and there's people me in this in this marketing doing that and I believe it so whenever I'm looking at offer I'm how easy is this promise to keep by the the practition of the person delivering it but how how valuable is it to the person relative right now into the immediate priority because that's the key is is it their current priority or is it a future one because getting someone to a million bucks a year who's on 10K a month that's a future priority getting them to 20K is a is a is a much more pressing current one so if you want a if you want a great offer and and you want conversions now which you need traction and momentum for then making a smaller promise that's relative to the market is going to be get you a lot more traction than a than a than a big promise which is constantly under inflation right well I think about it through the lens of the maso's hierarchy of The Hierarchy of Needs needs right it's you you solve the bottom needs and then you move up in the triangle and so everyone that we work with has survival needs they have it's a painkillers vitamins and bucket lists is it and so you can talk about something on someone's bucket list and that they might go 100% I want that right but are they willing to pull out the credit card and solve it now probably not because it's not the most pressing thing yeah and so an easy example I think about is in 10 Years bro I want to say goodbye to commercial flying right but I get served up ads and get emails for private jets all the time and I'm not right now it's not a survival need it's nice to have and so I think what's really important to think about is everyone has everyone's Perfect Fit prospects has that hierarchy painkillers vitamins bucket lists and so it's not this consistent thing where it's this is a good one and this is a bad one this is a survival need and this is a vitamin every person has those unique things even in different seasons so I remember being burnt out of my mind when we got to 100K a month in our agency and I spent weeks reading books on Sops team operations I hired Alex shaen to help me figure out meetings and culture I couldn't have cared less at six figures about that stuff I didn't even know that was a thing I didn't even I didn't even know

this is a bad one this is a survival need and this is a vitamin every person has those unique things even in different seasons so I remember being burnt out of my mind when we got to 100K a month in our agency and I spent weeks reading books on Sops team operations I hired Alex shaen to help me figure out meetings and culture I couldn't have cared less at six figures about that stuff I didn't even know that was a thing I didn't even I didn't even know what sop meant right and so it just goes to show that through each evolution of my business the survival needs changed so I I think having a dream outcome that's based on a survival need and is believable I think is the really important thing and then making sure that you're not overemphasizing the mechanics the plane trip the seat the air conditioning on the plane but really majoring on that Maui yeah yeah yeah I think I I'm a big proponent of a hybrid offer where you're you're selling once and you're you're selling people into multiple tiers but you're selling them over a long period of time but I still subscribe to the fact of there is a there is a painkiller in the first 8 to 16 weeks of of the engagement in that offer even if you're going to work together for 12 months and the dream outcome is is there you you're still talking about in your Lexicon which I is that that pain killer in the next we're going to remove the biggest pains in your life or your business or your body or whatever it is over the next 8 to 16 weeks and these are the steps we're going to take because that's the that's what they're buying into they're buying into that immediate relief they're buying into that what happens now yeah it's great I'm bought into the the big thing yeah but they're buying into the immediate relief that's what they say yes to that's what they commit to that's what they invest against and then you got to keep them on the track to get the the dream AR here's the key i' be intered to know what you The Dream Outcome think on a practical level so someone's trying to figure out the dream outcome this is this is how I do it yeah you can sit there and brainstorm and dream and open up the journal as much as you want and you might come up with some cool things I just go ask people it's crazy yeah yeah right so it's so so what's really important about this is that people can over complicate this and go but what's my what's the dream outcome I your promise it's firstly you're not the target market this is not for you it's for them that's critical that but right and so it's not what are you most excited about it's what are they most excited about and this is where it comes down to obviously we didn't talk about it but you got to find a person you're passionate about helping and build a business around that person rather than having 27 different possible prospects find a dream Prospect but one of the things I do this is when I I'm launching a lead magnet I'm launching a new offer I'm trying to find an angle I'm trying to find a promise is I just ask people so one of the things that I was exploring three years ago is I was I wonder if I create a program that's around making money but it's around becoming a top 1% coach and that idea lasted for 20 minutes when I DM 10 people and I said hey what do you think of the idea of becoming a top 1% coach and they're lame don't it doesn't connect I was perfect right I was messaging clients and Prospects and anyone else and so when I come with the lead magnet I might come up with three possible lead magnets and then I DM people or I run a poll on my Instagram or I post it on my Facebook Facebook and I say which out of these three

for 20 minutes when I DM 10 people and I said hey what do you think of the idea of becoming a top 1% coach and they're lame don't it doesn't connect I was perfect right I was messaging clients and Prospects and anyone else and so when I come with the lead magnet I might come up with three possible lead magnets and then I DM people or I run a poll on my Instagram or I post it on my Facebook Facebook and I say which out of these three resonates with you the most and I think it's so funny how we can over complicate this the the market research process we're oh we've got to go on Amazon and go on R it and go on all these things and and conduct all this research it's or you could just ask 10 15 20 as many people who will listen to you that are in your target market they could be already paying you or not and just give them some options give them some wording give them some verbage see what relates to them the most you got to pre-bake a few of those cookies right to test them out right I was I was talking to someone recently who had eight closes a sales manager two or three setters I can't remember if hell exists that's what it is exactly exactly right and I and I and I said to them would you be interested in me showing you how to sell the same volume that you're selling now without sales skills right right so I pre-baked their cookie because it's I know I can write an offer that replaces eight sales people yeah with that person cuz they've got an offer converting take all the stuff put it into my myth ology it's great yeah

[ __ ] yeah and then you say if you just don't tell the closes that I'm the one that told you to fire them that would be great and if you could not sh my that's extra that's an extra fee if I have to if I have to but but it's the same thing of pre-baking the pre-baking the idea of just ask them yeah can I take this pain away from you yeah right and so you got to have some hypothesis but you can come up with that in your own research but then you've just got to ask people yeah well this this guy Deja Be a Scientist from Twitter the guy I don't know who how he looks but his name is Ruby and I pay him for Voxer coaching and he has this phrase all the time he he be a scientist so he'll post something about online he's you guys should take more magnesium it's really good for you and everyone's but what brand but how much and he's just go be a scientist figure this out and I think a lot of us have lost that we're looking for the blueprint we're looking for a coach to sit with us and hold her hand and say you should promise this and the reality is is that everyone's Market Niche offer is different you're different and so there are variables at play you need to have a hypothesis and test things out get data and we learn this so well with Facebook ads right everything was a hypothesis you'd be I have a webinar I think will go well so I need to create five ad angles and each ad angle is going to have four different pieces of creative and then the ads manager and the algorithm is going to do its thing to test and see what's going to be the winning race horse we're going to bet on but when it comes to offers when it comes to building out a business we're looking for the best way a through Zed rather than being a scientist and testing these things out getting feedback not getting discouraged and just continuing to iterate and optimize yeah fully and I use the word hypothesis a lot and then a couple of weeks ago someone asked me what it meant and I was what's the and I was it's your best guess ah okay yeah cuz that's what it is you're approaching the market you've got some knowledge you've got some idea and you make your best guess and then you get data on it yeah by asking people running out whatever whatever the next tip is but that is a hypothesis isn't something something complicated it's something it's just simply your best guess and that you're willing you're just willing to be wrong about it I love it so 3 to four month program dream Program Dream Outcome outcome that's believable that's based on market research and based on not what you want but a a perfect fit Prospect survival needs the stuff that they're I'm willing to pay for this right now how would you deliver that because obviously you and I came from the course world right it was you have some modules you have a Facebook Community you have a call once a week that's our way that can still work but if you were to tell someone based on your experience now what they should do or what you would do if you were starting over again how would you structure that first few months so the way I used to do it was onboarding people in a linear fashion which is do this do this do this do this week one week two week three week four have it and it and it goes that what I found was the variables with different people at scale who are joining programs or joining group are very very high right and the more variables you have of the people joining your program the more you have to have infrastructure that caters for those variables so a practical example is the more variables you have the more questions you need and the more customer support you need the more questions you get in your group on your calls etc etc so from an efficiency point of view I found that having a onetoone call with somebody and having and Catering

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 2

dogs on the beach I want to spend time with my soon to be new wife and the the the young man's game is the fastest way to make money because you can deploy a lot of energy into it you can get people on the phone you can hustle you can grind you can do all those things and you make a ton of money and you might want to keep doing that or you might want to take it to the next level where you start hiring people you build a sales team to sell that you hire coaches to coach the people you hire Consultants to consult to the people etc etc that is the scalable part and what you will see in that path is that growth starts to slow down because your operations get larger you spend more money on things marketing and advertising there you you lose a little bit of contact with the clients so you not don't have your finger on the post because you're not the one selling and you're not the one Consulting and coaching at the mpce so the business starts to slow down so that time when you're the one on the phone selling that time when you're the only one coaching Etc is the fastest growth period and it's also the hardest because you have to be everything and the reason that I choose to go slowly and don't understand what the situation I'm in I've been doing this for a long time I've made a ton of money I have very strong cash flow I have very strong recurring Revenue so I can afford to go slowly but I also choose to go slowly I choose the old man's game I choose the slower smoother path because it has low stress it allows me to put the energy into places that that that matter and I lost sight for many years that the business was there to feed my life and I had many trade-offs in the course of when the kids were young and in my previous marriage Etc where it was growth at all cost that I would take the call even if it was the right thing wasn't the right thing for me and all of us because I was chasing the sale and I was chasing the deal even well past the point where I didn't need to do that I didn't need the money and I was on that Relentless Pursuit and that was costly it has been very costly I don't regret a single bit of it because it got me to where I am now which is in a wonderful spot but in in hindsight there were there were trade-offs that I that I tolerated for too long in that model and I'm saying this because I speak to a ton of people every day that can't let go of that because they're just on that Relentless cycle of trying to beat last month oh we did 200k last month and if we don't do 250 this month then it's all a disaster and it's whatever whatever story they're telling themselves I've heard them all and I'm saying this because there is a choice if you want to go fast I am not your guy if you want to go the fastest route which is getting on calls and closing people and selling to everybody who remotely resembles the your ideal target market then I'm not your guy there are there are really good people out there who do that day in day out and they run that model themselves and then they they also teach that model themselves some of them are speaking to me about how much they hate it but they still teach it so that's just between you and I but the the fact is that there are trade-offs in that model it is the fastest it's got some serious trade offs and it's got some serious downsides that that only become apparent while doing it but you know what I'm damn glad I did it the the 1500 odd sales skills I did made me damn good at selling it made me damn good at offer creation it may be damnn good at content and May and they're a very fast feedback loop so the old adage that slow as smooth and smooth as fast is very much true for me these days you

the fastest it's got some serious trade offs and it's got some serious downsides that that only become apparent while doing it but you know what I'm damn glad I did it the the 1500 odd sales skills I did made me damn good at selling it made me damn good at offer creation it may be damnn good at content and May and they're a very fast feedback loop so the old adage that slow as smooth and smooth as fast is very much true for me these days you can have an offer that which has a defined product promise a defined path and it defined specifics around it with pricing Etc that you can put in a Google doc a text document on a relatively pretty landing page and still make sales with that it will be slower and many cases you'll get better people because they will spend more time considering your content considering the offer and considering the promises you're making or not making in the case of it so it is a harder sell but by the time you've sold someone if you're more patient then the type of people you get tend to be more patient as well and in it for the long haul so the absolute fastest way isn't isn't necessarily the best way and this is where your discernment on who you're following what you work with and what strategies you use are ultimately down to your what you want and what you expect and what you need from your life because every single strategy out there that someone's selling works there are better people out there to follow and better people to invest in who have very much got it dialed in and and are much better teachers than others and there are people who will sell you things that work in fundamentals but they don't know how they work in principles so they don't they're not great at presenting it again discernment is required for me at the stage of life I'm at and the commitments I have the the selling from docs making content sending emails every day making these videos Etc it takes longer to get results and it takes longer than it would do if I was on the phone I would make triple the money that I do these days than if if I was taking calls and selling on the phone or if I decided to build a sales team and those things what if I built a sales team I'd probably make exactly the same profit and just have much much higher our overheads and just a much shorter sales cycle that's the reality so all to say there is a fast way I don't do it you may choose to do it but go in and choose the strategies that you're thinking about the the the market and the methods that you're going to use very carefully and think about the fact that I believe fundamentally your business is there to feed your life so if your business is sucking the life out of you then you might want to think about it but if your business is feeding your life you've got the time the money the energy to do the things you want then you're definitely on the right path Coaches: You Do Not Sell 'Confidence' or 'Clarity' just got off a workshop and getting ready for boxing apparently I'm getting better so got all the space to do it so had a workshop this morning about 85 people came and it was about content and as usual the usual folks turn up it's about half coaches and then half people who do other stuff and of the coaches about 50% of the people who work with me I'm going to sit down 50% of the people work with me sell money business coaches right and so business coaches people go well it's really easy to make a promise if you're a business coach who you sell money because it's tangible and how do James how do I improve my offer because it's easy for business coaches they can just help people make more money and that is true it is easy to make a clear offer about making more money I will help you make $100,000 give me $110,000 oversimplification but that works but there were

me sell money business coaches right and so business coaches people go well it's really easy to make a promise if you're a business coach who you sell money because it's tangible and how do James how do I improve my offer because it's easy for business coaches they can just help people make more money and that is true it is easy to make a clear offer about making more money I will help you make $100,000 give me $110,000 oversimplification but that works but there were a lot of people there who sold personal development healing Fitness and these things which are in their eyes less tangible and I've had this for years and ironically some of my most successful clients over the years don't sell money they don't sell business coaching they don't sell strategy they sold help they sold personal development they sold Fitness and the reason they were successful is I helped them make their office tangible and one of the things that and if you're selling personal development selling Fitness Etc is that people talk about I sell confidence or I sell Clarity and you don't you cannot sell those things because they are outcomes of doing things right you do not need to have Clarity on how to become a millionaire you just need to do the things that are required to become a millionaire you do not need to believe and have the confidence that you can become a millionaire you just need to do the things that are required to have it there is plenty of unconfident millionaires but in the course of selling personal development lots of people default to I help people become more confident I help people with Clarity and the correlation the causation is just really the wrong way around because people become Confident by taking action being consistent with that action I

. E not lying to themselves and their confidence develops but again pepper throughout this I've said the word doing an action right so if you're in the personal development space if you're selling Fitness or anything that Fitness is a little bit easier because you can be tangible about muscle gain or fat loss or specific performance metrics but if you're in the personal development space you are not in the business of selling confidence and Clarity you are in the business of selling specific actions that that person has confidence in that if they do that action that on the other side they will get more confidence and more clarity so a a tangible example the other factor of these examples is that there needs to be an incentive for people to do it people don't just seek to improve themselves without an incentive people don't seek to heal trauma without an incentive so someone who came on the workshop today they help people with trauma and we talked about specific sexual trauma and one of the things that people with those traumas have is they tend to heal that trauma when they have an incentive to do so and the incentive is I'm absolutely sick to death of living this and I've reached the end of my tolerance for this so therefore I want to live a better life the other one is they enter a relationship where the cost of the trauma they see the direct cost of the trauma affecting their relationship so therefore they seek they have a high incentive to heal that trauma and so I said to her two things firstly you need to talk to the incentive if you're in a relationship you want to heal your heal your traa now is the time so you talk to the the symptoms of of of these things coming up you talk to the your content talks to the symptoms of that your trauma is getting in the way of your intimacy that your trauma is pushing your partner away and here's an example of someone who did that and they lost their relationship but here's an example who of someone who used my XYZ me mechanism prev and they went from pushing their partner away because of their trauma to to welcome and and then them enjoying intimacy every day so the tangible things are okay you need an incentive to do it but you also need to take tangible action and this is where mechanisms come in you are not selling the outcomes you are selling the mechanisms that people do so with my terrific trauma protocol in in 30 days you'll heal your trauma so you can have more confidence more intimacy and more on on the other side you are never in the business of selling the things that are on the other side of something you are in the business of selling the the mechanisms that go into it because that allows people to see what you sell and what you buy what they are buying and allows you to differentiate in the market for people who are talking about these things of confidence you can't point at those things to say this is a mechanism it does this in this period of time you're going to invest in this mechanism because you have the incentive to do so because you're in a relationship or you're sick to death of the the the thing that you're doing so all offers and all messages can become tangible if you point out the things that happen as an outcome a tangible pointable result confidence so you can have a better relationship or you point at a tangible mechanism that people have an input through because if you keep talking in these generic woolly terms about oh yeah people will become more confident when they work with me and people that then you're confusing what people buy and you're confusing the ultimate outcomes that you derive because those outcomes are a bu product of the action and the work that people ultimately do so selling supposedly intangible things becomes very simple when you point at things that they are buying you point at incentives that they have to to do it right now and you point at ultimately the distinct outcomes that they have and those outcomes monetary outcomes are are easy for people to Value but outcomes that are behavioral or or that show up in people's lives so you can have more intimacy every day be become much more tangible than these

because those outcomes are a bu product of the action and the work that people ultimately do so selling supposedly intangible things becomes very simple when you point at things that they are buying you point at incentives that they have to to do it right now and you point at ultimately the distinct outcomes that they have and those outcomes monetary outcomes are are easy for people to Value but outcomes that are behavioral or or that show up in people's lives so you can have more intimacy every day be become much more tangible than these generic ideas every offer can be made tangible it just requires a little bit of looking and and know stepping back from the mixing up of the of the correlation and the causation of the work that you do I personally help people make money they do the work and they they get the outcomes and they get the benefits and they use that money to do things you know which is the a lot of the other stuff I talk about they do use that money to live a better life but at the end of the day I point at the outcomes I point the mechanism and I point at the things that that people can see and value and that works no matter what you sell What's Working in 2025 To Get High Ticket Clients I ran my first Facebook ad in 2017 so I guess I'm a veteran back in the back in the day when you were own a Facebook ad you could get a booked call and sell someone a very expensive you know Consulting program for about 50 in the time New Zealand dollars so you could run an ad get someone to a vsl convince them that you knew what you were talking about understand what they needed prove prove that you understand what they needed get them on a call and sell them a $22 to $10,000 Consulting program and people still do that to this day and it doesn't cost $50 anymore and everybody I talked to who still runs core funnels and still runs ads to them always report costs going up the only exception in this and one of the biggest Moes that people have these days is someone with a brand if you've got a large person brand a large brand on YouTube or on Instagram or one of those where people are pre-sold on you then you book a core funnels and these things still really work most people don't have a large personal brand Everybody's Got a Brand but most people don't have a large manufactured intentional personal brand and so in 2025 you are steering into the headwinds of a low trust environment the fact is that lots of people have been making lots of big bold crazy in many cases unrealistic promises and we are in a low trust environment and back 10 years ago just your Boomer parents would believe every sing single thing on the news people believed every single thing they saw on the internet and they bought the claims they bought the promises and they bought into everything and you know you could pretty much sell anything these days we are in a very low trust environment and that means the the marketing and the force that people are putting into marketing to try and convince people of those things is a it's less effective because we're in a low trust environment and B there's just way more people doing it so the the the signal to noise ratio has changed dramatically and so that brings us to the present day so 24 hours ago I ran a workshop and on that Workshop ironically I showed people my workshop process of how I sell Workshop tickets for $100 and how I generate multiple thousand High ticket customers off the back of that and one of the things that we did in the Q&A so we went for about 2 and a half hours and about half of that is teaching and about half of that is just Q&A where I just help people one of the things I said in that environment is that we have to give people an experience the days are are are they're not gone but they're coming to an end where people will be nurtured through a multi step funnel where they'll see lots and lots of pieces of content and eventually

of the things that we did in the Q&A so we went for about 2 and a half hours and about half of that is teaching and about half of that is just Q&A where I just help people one of the things I said in that environment is that we have to give people an experience the days are are are they're not gone but they're coming to an end where people will be nurtured through a multi step funnel where they'll see lots and lots of pieces of content and eventually do something and eventually book a cool people are far more cynical and far more skeptical and they're far more preserv preserving of their time so it's never cost more to generate get someone to a webinar and and sell them on the webinar it's never cost more to get someone to book a call and so in the in a low trust environment what do you do you have to allow people to prove things to themselves with their very own eyes and we do this through experience so yesterday on that Workshop I sold the tickets to that workshop for $9 $9 is a no-brainer price I sold hundreds and hundreds of tickets and just over 100 people turned up at the peak and a lot of people catching it on the replay today and and and reaching out to me and what I did on that Workshop was give people an experience if because I allow people on the workshop to ask me a question to get help from me I'm giving them a small small taste of what it might be to work with me what it might be to be able to rent my brain once or twice a week which I allow people to do in my client programs and through that experience they can build up their own judgment by having that experience I could say 50 things to these people and prove case studies and prove this and prove that and they would look at them with skepticism but I can do more and give more experience in a 60c conversation or even someone witnessing a 60 second conversation than I can with my giving people information and showing them all the way and that's all marketing is really doing it's trying to shift beliefs through information and showing people things and tell and telling them as well and in 2025 the thing that's going to work is to give people experience that is why I'm prepared to do things drop my pants if you for $9 by selling a workshop ticket so cheap just to allow people to give that experience and 42 people signed up to something off the back of that workshop for something else between 50 and $750 a week because I gave them an experience and so if you are good at what you do this should be very very exciting because you were sitting on assets that you can allow people to experience and you shouldn't be too worried about what you sell those assets for as long as you have those assets leading to another asset I am quite happy to sell $9 Workshop tickets because I'll sign the best people up to join my membership or get be coached by me or join The Syndicate and get access to me I'd be quite happy to do that because it leads to something else and even if someone goes away you know and they got multiple times what they thought in terms of value of $9 even if they don't buy something there's some Goodwill in the market I've delivered I've overd delivered relative to what they paid and the time they dedicated so Marketing in 2025 isn't marketing you know it's demonstration and its experience it's giving people the experience of what it could be to do this and you could do this through low ticket products you could do it through AI tools you could do it through workshops you can do it through any experience where someone interacts with you these days I'd be much more mindful to sell a Consulting call than I would to book a free sales call I think it's far more targeted and valuable valuable for someone I think it's far more insightful and experiential for someone and you're far more likely to get a great long term client out of

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 8

that is multiple times of someone :48 who's watched exactly the same content over 12 months y and you need somewhere that allows that total attention time :55 YouTube allows it it allows people to bench on your stuff email does as well because people can you :02 know sort and categorize things and look for them the other social platforms less so because of algorithms and it you can :08 have profiles and those things but it's not natural for people to go and click on someone's profile and read everything necessarily they did and :14 that's why Facebook groups work really well because it allows people to go to one place and consume stuff in a really convenient way yeah so you need a place :20 where you're going to make consistently but I think you also need a place where people can binge binge your stuff and go :26 deep on it before they make the decision because most sales happen before the sale has taken place right y :33 so people are posting they've picked a platform they should be posting consistently I would say every day and :39 whether people say that is that 5 days or seven days the answer is yes right pick one short medium long right so I :46 post on my stories every day sometimes it's absolutely nothing sometimes it's client testimonial sometimes it's linking to a training I post on the news :52 feed when I feel it and then I do right now we're at four YouTube videos a week but that's only one me :58 sitting down and creating a video the other three are recordings of calls and things that so I think whether you :04 just start with one and I think the easiest place to start honestly for most people is a podcast if they just have conversations in personal :10 virtually some people aren't ready to look at a camera and hold people's attention for 10 15 20 minutes on a :17 topic which is fine have conversations with people you find fascinating just make sure that there's a conversation :22 happening and not an interview because then the person that that your audience member is listening is getting to know the other person and still has no idea :28 who you are but I think short medium long on a very practical note I'll share this you can add anything there's :35 four types of content that I've found in terms of main piece of content teach show share give teach what you :41 know share who you are show client results and how how what you do Works give people opportunities to take :48 next steps with you give away assets who wants this comment below post on the stories see me a DM and then regular :55 calls to action that could be weekly in small doses as in if you want to find out more information about this or :01 monthly or cyclical six to eight weeks around cash campaigns doors closing stuff that that's how I see :07 it from a practical perspective anything you want to add on that yeah I've got the three PS which is proof problem and philosophy right so the proof is :15 client results and I to give client results of insight what step I I think testimonials are

[ __ ] :20 personally because I don't people don't pay attention to them and people they're always crafted in a way to manipulate :27 somebody lots of marketing I've got this case study format which says here's Bob and he made 100 Grand and :33 these are the three steps he took to do it and I find that it replicates much better for people to go that could be me :39 and the proof Factor philosophy is who are you what do you believe what's your worldview and those things :45 and occasionally being pretty polarizing in there State what you believe nowadays in the safest possible :51 way maybe not everything you believe but the things that are definitely digestible and then problem which is you :57 know the functional solving of the of the pains that people are in in front of them and giving them assets to do it or or solving a problem with them so :04 let's talk about how to stand out yeah so you're creating content short medium long right stuff that disappears in a :09 Day stuff that has some lasting effect and stuff that people can binge they've got the Frameworks proof :15 philosophy what was the third one problem problem perfect how do people :20 stand out yeah because they can listen to everything we're talking about they're I started the podcast and it's not working I think it's what's :26 really important to to note for anyone who stumbled on this I know cuz this is what it gets into the real Nuance of the :32 person exactly so people who might have stumbled onto this need to know neither of us sell with sales calls yeah so the :39 cheapest thing I sell is 18 Grand I think yours is probably similar and it happens without a sales call and :46 these aren't old leads these aren't people that have followed me for 5 years some of these people 5 days into my world but they done the total attention :53 time they've gone deep and Etc the key that I I'll just mention some of the feedback that I get is to why people :59 work with me is and I never used to get this feedback this is all this year when I really focused in on it so one of :07 the things I I hear a lot is I don't really know why you're standing out :12 I've been really loving your content but I feel there's something different about your energy right and this can :18 come down to silly things we joked earlier a few months ago early this year about me buying chickens and so I'm :25 living here in barley we live a very similar life but I have chickens and you don't that makes us different :30 people to other people's perception a only a certain type of person has :36 chickens you've got a dog but if you had a cat you'd be a certain type of person that if you shared that online it would :42 be a differentiator right if you were the exact same person but you're here was blue if you bleached blue :48 here the perception of who you are would change you could be saying the same things but :54 people perceive you in a different way so one of the mistakes those people make is they try and pretend to be someone :00 they're not so they go oh Dan's got chickens I'm going to buy a chicken and I'm going to post a photo on mine and :05 that's a stupid example of things people do all the time they get the Miami Penthouse they get the Rolex they're :10 having cigars with the boys they're taking whatever it might be they see what someone else is done and they replicate it but the problem is it's :17 what what works is authenticity yeah so talk to us about how people can :22 stand out more not just through being b or smarter but being more of :28 themselves the old topic of being yourself is the infinite the infinite game roide yeah it's Pandora's :34 Box and you're but my my

[ __ ] all leaders :25 in the world and people want something to follow right so and your and your you :31 have you haven't crafted an identity you didn't get the chickens to look good on the internet you got the chickens cuz :38 you animals right and people are I admire Dan because he's doing what he wants to do bro it's killing me :44 I've got one disa chicken that everyone's tell bring with you our new :50 we can't talk about the chickens you've left but no I'm not playing a character on the internet pretends to :55 no it's it's just the're real chickens I've seen them I picked them up but there's the to me it's how :02 do you stand out you be a leader right and for me I did it a different way which is this is what I'm going to :08 do M and then I did it yeah which if you think about it is extremely rare yeah in in the world today I said this :14 is what I'm going to do this is my update against that and this is what this is what I'm doing next and everyone :20 goes that so cool that's amazing I now trust you more than I did before because :27 they're and I said this is what and there were two things on there that I'm not doing and I didn't do and I'm :32 this is why I changed my mind on these things cuz I got I was in the trenches and I did it and I changed my mind on a :38 couple of things that was my way MH and in the in the course of being very :43 transparent about why I did that and you've been very transparent about why :48 you're doing what you're doing and to me that it all comes back to that y why are you doing this yeah because :56 without a reason why people have no resonance with the reason if if your :02 reason why of buying a Miami Penthouse and those things are really strong and valid yeah to you and they're :10 established to you people will follow along with that if your reason why is because the other people did it :16 they won't yeah so exactly the same people can take exactly the same actions but if the reason why is absent in in a :23 true sense then everybody knows it Y and if you treat your audience fools or :28 the treat treat people fools who are watching and going I'm just doing this because everyone else is doing it :35 they don't pay attention it's congruence right that's what we're looking for that always is so sensitive to as human beings finely tuned

[ __ ] detectors :42 yeah well I I so finely tuned I'm in the process of moving doctors right now and so I've been dealing with thyroid :48 stuff and I'm trying to find this guy and I sent I sent him to to a friend and I was do :53 anything about this guy and he's I know almost nothing but the stuff that I've seen I believe you really believes :59 it and I just think he has awesome energy and just intuitively it feels the right move for you and I was :04 that's really interesting and then we went on this rant of talking about energy and picking people's up :10 picking up people's intention and congruence and authenticity and so before anyone thinks that their job now :17 if they're a fitness coach is to post their business plan to Facebook of I'm :23 I'm at 10K a month and I want to get to 30k a month and the people who the single Ms who want to lose weight that the say clientele don't don't care what :30 you're really talking about is also motivation and why and authenticity and congruence because one of the clients :35 that I work with works with people in I can't remember what the language is but it's you're in :41 physical pain but it's neurological right so it's sematic pain relief or something that and he is so :47 passionate about what he does because he helped his mom heal chronic pain through his process and so that's his :53 whole motivation I've had worked with someone else before who was a weight loss coach who helped his mom lose :58 150 pounds and saved your life and so there's that particular piece that I think is really key which is that :04 if you're just showing up as someone on the internet trying to sell something you lose the ability to connect with people to a deep level because people :10 want to know why you're doing what you're doing yeah let's talk about some practicals around tone and :16 personality so you I was showing you my AI bot before the the Dan AI and I'm so :21 excited to roll that to client it's it's hundreds of hours of my it's been trained on hundreds of hours of my :27 content but what it's missing is tone so I'm almost happy with it it :33 says stuff that I wish I would say or I did say once upon a time that I forgot right but it's missing tone and so it :40 doesn't sound me MH one of the things that I found that really interesting when I first started on :46 the online space was LinkedIn especially was this hilarious place where people :52 pretended to be someone they weren't and so you would look at their profile and it was advisor investor five times :57 founder and then you do a sales call do dot dot they're yeah I'm working parttime at a tire shop and you're :04 what's going on that's an extreme example of something that people do is that I find I hang out with some :09 people and I'm surprised at how much I them or vice versa and because the version of who they are :16 online and the version of who they are in real life the real them is there's this huge Connect Now obviously there's :22 levels of people overthinking things imposter syndrome what will people think of me but talk to me about :28 how you think about tone because I think neither of us take each other or ourselves very seriously we're :34 constantly talking crap and not in just a silly way but just it we're not we're not afraid to point fun at :40 ourselves we laugh at each other talk to me about how tone plays into standing out online I think that :49 it all roads lead back to that self-esteem and that comfort thing as well the I'm pretty dry right and :57 I'm right that and I speak that and I am that right your your

of us take each other or ourselves very seriously we're :34 constantly talking crap and not in just a silly way but just it we're not we're not afraid to point fun at :40 ourselves we laugh at each other talk to me about how tone plays into standing out online I think that :49 it all roads lead back to that self-esteem and that comfort thing as well the I'm pretty dry right and :57 I'm right that and I speak that and I am that right your your :03 online content and your personality they're the same thing right my online content and my personality they're :10 pretty much the same thing yeah right so I think it's I hate that authenticity word yeah but I think I :16 think it's turning up as yourself unapologetically and and and speaking the speaking through but speaking the :24 way that you speak yeah because people again have that that :29 desperation to truly see somebody Y and I and it's interesting a client was me :34 messaging me today saying I've got a referral for you and I was okay cool and and she shared a screenshot and :41 it was someone noticing a shift in her and her content and she said I can :47 finally see you and it's so good and I've known you and she's you must be working with James yeah because they :54 they're in the in the same world but it's the ton is I'm finally because I know you I can finally :00 see you and I think we we're desperate as humans we're desperate to connect with people and we're desperate to truly :05 see and not be deceived so when when you truly just turn up in the way that you want to turn up as yeah then that comes :13 through all these different channels that comes through in video that comes through in content that comes through in text yeah and if you turn up as yourself :20 then you can't be you can't be competed with yeah right and I think this is a on :25 on a really practical note it also takes practice so it's how do you find your voice you just speak a lot and :32 write a lot and then over time you figure that out because I think it's with appointment sitting right and :39 I don't really do much of that these days but I respond to messages and one of the things that I find is that people :44 are happy to have a conversation in real life and then it's they fumble the ball in the DMS because they're :50 this person said this but if I say this then what are they going to say well I lose the sale and and it's just overing what do I say to get the sale and I'm :57 be curious about where they are be curious about where they want cuz these people it you working on that it's :05 the best sell by chat script is curiosity of being interested in somebody yeah but but my point here is :11 that people just have to do it so part of what we're saying is that some people are stuck being inauthentic :18 because they're not making the decision to go all in on them yeah and some people are three pieces of content in :23 yeah the answer is a thousand more yeah right to really find your full expression for me I find that I :29 have a sense of humor off stage in my real life and the moment I tried to bring that on stage in the early days I :34 was trying to write jokes the problem was not my type of humor right so now when I'm funny it's always exactly the :42 same as I am in real life which is in the moment yeah right and so it's just through the repetitions and the practice :48 that I think people need to commit to in order to get to that place of as :54 funny as it sounds it takes practice to be yourself it really does and also if :00 people really want it they've got to understand whether the

to write jokes the problem was not my type of humor right so now when I'm funny it's always exactly the :42 same as I am in real life which is in the moment yeah right and so it's just through the repetitions and the practice :48 that I think people need to commit to in order to get to that place of as :54 funny as it sounds it takes practice to be yourself it really does and also if :00 people really want it they've got to understand whether the trade-offs are worth it that I I hear people say a lot :07 I want to have a coaching or Consulting business but I don't want to put myself out there the only :13 alternative path to that is lots of money for ads right so you either use :18 the energy of connection or use the energy of money mhm both of them :23 put you out there both of them put messages that resonate with people that they respond to that come towards you so :29 if you'd rather do the path of doing the Reps and going organic and :35 publishing content then you've got to put yourself out there if you'd rather do the path of getting ads and putting people through funnels and :41 nurturing them and taking the time to do that then you got to put money in yeah there there's there's not a third :47 path yeah so make the choice so let's talk about team so firstly team is to Choose Your Own :53 Adventure and that if you sell via calls yeah versus DMS if you do all the coaching yourself or you get a coach :59 that's a variable right I would say we both agree that you should get a virtual assistant y ASAP y if you don't have an :07 assistant you are an assistant as our friend Tony Fraser Jones once told me yeah right so I think day day one :13 you could find 30 minutes a day of admin to get in a virtual assistant yeah where do the pressure come on the most :19 for people typically when scaling is it is it firstly on the sales side or the :25 coaching side yeah so the two the two gaps come up first are a skills gap which is I've run out of ways :31 I've run out of knowledge or ability to do this so I need to go and find somebody to do it or a time or a time :37 one so that generally when people are at the beginning one or both both of those show :44 up and that that's that's pretty challenging to navigate but the first I I agree with the first h VA but :51 then the next tire should be where is the bottleneck right do you this is :57 the key way to think about it people it's not just oh the second higher as always is this person here's the :02 perfect dog chat the the where is the bottleneck and where is the bottleneck where that you can step out of and you :09 know and solve the bottleneck through the process of a human or Contracting someone so it's the bottleneck at the front with leads and sales sorry is it :16 at the front with with leads is it in the Middle with sales or is it the end with delivery right and then it's :22 do you hire a coach or a conci you've got a couple of choices there do you hire a saleson a closer to do more :29 to do more reps or do you hire someone to get in the DMS run leads run funnels and get leads and :36 convert them into prospects yeah so it's it's a bottleneck analysis as the :41 the first major hire if you because the virtual assistant is relatively easy to find you might go through two or three but the biggest thing I see :49 with virtual assistant is the Rel L inexpensive in the world that we're in and people are I don't have enough :54 work for them to do and you're you said the average virtual assistant :00 30 minutes an hour a day you're paying them to

[ __ ] that yeah but it was okay this business thing can be really simple you can just have something that people want so I started a finance company but the I got a consumer credit license in the UK and I went door-to-door and I sold photography packages right and low income areas so I would knock on a door and I'd sell them a photography package for 200 quid right and then they'd pay it off interest free over 20 weeks yeah 10 pounds a week and then after four weeks I could go and sell that to a finance company who'd pay me more than the face value of everything and I made a couple hundred quid off each one yeah and I was this is good this is good and then but look quick pause was it good in the sense of how did you find the work part of it you're knocking on doors selling photography was that was a brutally hard season of learning the skills and having doors shut in your face see I didn't and even in hindsight I didn't right because when I was at school all my friends were going to work at the mall to do present wrapping and work at the body shop in the warehouse over Christmas right when we're 14 15 and I was screw that you get five bucks an hour right and I went to do work in a galvanizing Factory for 20 bucks an hour look we're stacking magazines so I was always where's the highest yield I didn't I never minded the work yeah so I think going forward into knocking on door sucks right because the the level of rejection and danger you get yeah is ridiculous but I never even in hindsight and maybe I've romanticized it because I've told the story many times yeah even in hindsight I didn't find it difficult I found it interesting because I love I love creating something and offering it someone else and and then learning and tweaking along the way and that's been the consistent path through there yeah right so you're so you're selling these doing the stuff door-to-door yeah and then where did it go from there so I learned WordPress and I learned SEO because the the guys I was selling my leads to they were we're doing online leads yeah so I self-taught myself WordPress and I self-taught myself SEO and I started dabbling with Google ads right so I started generating leads online so I could get an online lead for six or seven pounds and sell it for 50 Quid to these they're they're called kneecap finance companies they're dot they trap people and it which I look back in hindsight and go yeah the moral wait a minute the moral things and that's what made me end it yeah because I was I saw someone say if you can't imagine being in this business in five years why are you even in it today yeah but and correspondingly at the same time I got done and I had a 70 000 pound in bill that I owed on ads and all these things for leads that I couldn't sell to them because they all went out of business and the financial crisis oh okay so that was around the time in 2008 2009 so in the space of a couple of weeks all my customers went out of business and stopped paying me the financial crisis hit and found out we're pregnant with our first child what was that period of your life again as a marketer probably romanticized it so it's even it's even more difficult yeah yeah that was

[ __ ] stressful it was unbelievably stressful but it's in those moments where you're what do I really want to do who do I really want to be and was that clear to you at that time or is that something that was evolving no not at all I think in hindsight the North Star has always been the tinkering piece making something putting it out there I was always a top performer in sales because I'd always be interested in the person an interest in the psychology of what I was saying what was coming across the dynamic the relationship and those things and I think the next thing that I did I was sitting at home one night watching everything crumble and I emailed a startup in London called living social so Groupon and living social have both come onto the market a daily deals market and then just exploded into this thing because local businesses could use them to get customers which is notoriously difficult right and I emailed the general manager who they'd come to London they had about four or five people and he said can you be in central London at eight o'clock the next morning it's yeah it was a response that do an email at 11 o'clock at night got there got the job on the spot and then 16 months later there were 350 people they've been funded with 800 Million by Amazon I was in the middle of another thing which was all about making lots of offers right and and but in the online space this is fascinating because I don't even know this stuff I know I know the New Zealand Origins yeah I didn't quite know the UK stuff and so at this time was I'm fascinated because most entrepreneurs have the story of I was born an entrepreneur I was unemployable I kept getting fired from places that doesn't seem it's your story I'm sure there were moments of this is hard I would rather be doing my own thing but were apart from the tinkering was was Freedom autonomy sovereignty was that a big part of the value set at that point or did that come over time as you're exposed to more the online space and people talking about it yeah it was only after Max was born so max is my son it's only after Max was born that I started to look at them environment we're in and not one to not want to have children in the in the system the type of things that we call them that we maybe not say out loud the consequence of what I did became much more real yeah that it wasn't just me and I could float through and it didn't matter if I maybe did things that were compromising values working in an industry that keeps people in debt didn't matter right there's no consequence it was I was making money who cares yeah yeah but after he was born I was looking at what we are in in the system yeah in terms of the system of society and especially in Western society and I was okay you need to have options yeah and the belief that has never gone away is true freedom is Downstream of Financial Freedom yeah so you can make a lot of impact and all these words the buzzwords but unless you've got choices yeah you can't really get to True Freedom and people can throw around what that means to them and it is very personal but it was until Max was born that I really thought I need to cultivate an environment where I'm living in something that gives some choices yeah because of that sense that the world's not going to be the same and if it's the same as it is now then I'd rather plot an alternative course right around it yeah I I feel I didn't even have a work ethic until I got married and especially when I had my first kid Brooklyn seven years ago that was when I felt was I found another gear I was oh okay I the stakes are higher especially because my wife and I for most of our 20s were working for the church we were broke but we were it was a mutually we both decided we were going to be broke and so neither one of us was resentful or bitter it was we're

. S startup but I was in I was in London about two years ahead of the sophistication curve of what what was going to happen what was the market expanding into products expanding into travel and those things yeah and so I went back did some stuff with them on travel and a sales role when you saying we're back you went back to New Zealand went back to New Zealand yeah and that was always in the plan but that freedom thing was under I used to listen to a podcast called tropical MBA right and it was by two two dudes down and in who were here in Bali right at the time over a decade ago wow they were talking about one megabit internet and pitted roads and stuff that which is a bit different to now yeah yeah but the vibe was the same yeah that was that was the beginning of the digital Nomad digital Nomad became a phrase yeah right and I was going on the train into work listening to these dudes jamming and it was that was happening along the way in terms of the the underlying soundtrack of this something something else going on yeah and then went back to New Zealand and went worked on travel got was made marketing manager and my marketing director within a few months and again it's right in the middle of this environment where you can test human psychology right which is addictive right yeah you put these things out there on mass and large numbers and how people respond yeah and that that's super addictive to me so I've always been in the middle of that interrelationship and the feedback loop of in business of making offers and and watching those things come back and how are people responding to this how are they acting yeah but and that cut my teeth in terms of to where we are now and what we do now and so in that time was were you approaching things as an artist or an engineer was there a mix of both was it you feeling you were creating or is building the machine and the numbers and the we sent out an email that got this click-through rate was it a mix of both how are you naturally wired and what was coming out of their time at the time it was not artists it was more teacher whereas I've stopped the responsibility of being a fan rather seriously in terms of being I'm trying to be a model and I distinctly remember before I went back to New Zealand I made a commitment to give all my ideas away right so I started accepting stuff that scared the

[ __ ] out of me speaking gigs and those things which in hindsight was a great move yeah because when I wanted to leave Consulting and those things were not not a problem right because I built a profile and built a reputation and a 100 million dollar business yeah and I think around that time I imagine you probably didn't have the scarcity that kicks in when you then start charging for your information because when you start charging for information you're well if I'm charging for it over here and I give it away over here it must devalue the thing that people are buying yeah but you didn't have that you just had the I'm in the trenches doing it I'm just going to share it because that means no less for me if the thing that I'm doing yeah yeah and it means I don't have the struggle story of when I started Consulting as well right my first monthly invoice 40 Grand yeah perfect because I was mentored by senior people who were you go into companies you tell them what to do you hope they listen and they pay your invoices every month yeah so was it so the Consulting Journey because that sounds it evolved really naturally you became really good in your industry you got head hunted from UK to New Zealand you Rose up the ranks there and then did that Consulting naturally go to in-person consultation where you're working with a team in person it's it's more corporate c-suite type stuff yeah corporate where I had a reputation as someone who was really comfortable sitting in a boardroom and talking the talk commercially right but also getting down on the trenches right because I'd worked in startups you had to be that you had to know how to run a Facebook ad yeah because there wasn't always someone there to do it but you also knew had to know how to talk about a 10 million budget yeah right so the two different skill sets in the end of the spectrum so I was quite used filters when some companies were going into the scrappy incubator stage we're going to start up lots of internal tests and start businesses inside where I go along and talk to them in corporate speak but also startup speak because they knew that I'd be happy to get my hand to roll my sleeves up and do stuff and so when you think back to that period was that a seamless transition was that something that came with reservations or fears there was any sense of imposter syndrome because I know working with people in the online space and it's different when you go from I'm using my Facebook for friends and family and then all of a sudden I'm a business coach and there's that element but going from being the person who got had a job was paying to do it to now teaching other people was there things you had to overcome was there a story you had to unravel what was that process for you to get started the biggest thing the biggest thing for me was a discipline of it because the work was so easy that I had to learn lots of things to Pat it out you know so there was a discipline of it of is this am I doing the right thing am I doing the right am I doing the right job because lots of people wouldn't even listen to the advice that I was giving them yeah right so then you start to have the moral questions around it but I I had the easiest start to Consulting ever because I consulted back to the company that I that I was formerly a marketing director right so it's struggle to get your first client we just signed the people you used to work with and then start adding clients from there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for four months too long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would walk me through it and something about the weekly coaching sessions that's a a relic of of old we've been together for an hour I drive to you you

there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for four months too long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would walk me through it and something about the weekly coaching sessions that's a a relic of of old we've been together for an hour I drive to you you drive to me we do it on Zoom whatever and making the decision you want to make but are too scared to make it yeah and seeking permission in some other way yeah so the big fear was leaving my first client but that's when I'm met a young Sam Evans young saying moments I love it all Circle back to him in a second because obviously he played a crucial role for both he did yeah but with you in the role that you're in then being able to consult yeah it sounds it's nice for you James but I have to you know get clients and I don't have that but also for you I imagine there was years behind the scenes you're kind of skimming over the fact that I imagine there was a lot of really deep skill set building throughout that time it wasn't just right place right time I could talk the talk I imagine there was the hours of podcasts the blogs the whatever it might be what did that process of building the skill set so the company that you worked for they still had to see enough value in what you did to want to pay you the money that you charged what was that process to build that skill set at work right I I developed a deep skill set across sales and marketing specifically by doing it yeah right in the in the train it's had Blue Chip sales Vodafone BMW and Xerox sales training which is Xerox sales training in Europe is considered to be the best sales training on earth right relationship building and those things from corporate Enterprise all the way down to selling phones in a shop yeah a Vodafone when I worked in there in New Zealand when I was a student and it's getting the skills on the and but also and I think I'm more ruthless about these days it's focusing on what you're good at because there's so much idealism around skill acquisition because everything's a skill yeah and it's and it's really okay double down on what you're good at and largely ignore the bits that you that you aren't and that's a tough lesson to learn I was a terrible people manager right and I inherited these teams and I didn't know what didn't know how to manage I'm gonna run ads guys it's going to be awesome yeah but I'd lean in on the commercials on the marketing on the detail of those things yeah and go back to them and the results will always take take you through you don't have to be the easiest person to work with yeah you don't even have to be liked but if you're effective you can go a really long way right so I think I always focused on things I was effective at and avoid it out of probably internal fear all the things I was I was I was proving to be bad at yeah which I think is also underrated I think too many people try to generalize too fast yeah I've shamed myself horribly for that over the years of no I should build a team yeah I should be a good manager I should be this I should be there and it doesn't matter how hard you wish for it if there's no true genuine desire there yeah it's very difficult to acquire skills when you don't have desire behind them yeah it's very difficult to wear I really want to be good at this and I need to be good at this when there's no actual want deep inside you to want to do it well well I think we'll come back to this but this idea that business needs to be hard is a really prevalent one because I think business is already hard because we have to grow and gain

# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 9

. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Right?, the famous question, this is the bedrock of not everything, but this is the bedrock of having an effortless high velocity business and whatever, domain it is. The semantics around coaching, consulting, and, and mentorship will, go well beyond my, my death. But, I'll be there for the, I'll be there for the discussion. ## Understanding Power Laws in Client Value and Ascension **Summary:** Client value isn't linear; power laws dictate that a small percentage of clients will contribute a disproportionately large amount of revenue. Recognizing and working with these power laws is crucial for maximizing business outcomes. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** I've developed a new way of looking at client value and ascension. And I don't say that lightly, and it was just, again, it was a change of lens. I've been talking about power laws for a very long time because my observation after serving thousands of people and, and, and, and also my career selling hundreds of millions of dollars of product and seeing what happened, what, what the actual behavior behind the scenes was, is that power laws are present in buying and selling in, in, in almost everything. Results are not linear at all. Right? So in our world, all clients are not created equal. The power laws are absolutely everywhere, right? And I can now spot when people are fighting against them because they're taking a linear approach, or whether they're working with them because they're taking a, an approach that looks through the lens of a power law. So we either work with them or we fight against them. The difference between them is very, very stark. And again, this is why I see businesses struggling in markets that are, are valid and effective with valid skills, valid products, etc., because they take a linear approach to the market and see diminishing returns, and then they get exhausted through it. So show me someone who's brute forcing the hours and the effort, and I'll show you someone who is running laps around them with just almost doing nothing. The difference between working with reality or against it is gigantic, right? So when we put a lot of effort into things, that doesn't mean we're going to get a return because it's relative to the, the law that we're operating under. So while a ton, and I've observed this for a long time, a ton of effort in this space goes into signing clients, very little effort goes into considering how much that client wants and needs from you, and what they will ultimately spend. There are just assumptions all the way down because you have a $10,000 offer, then you were looking for $10,000 people. The reality is that 99% of the people in the audience are not $10,000 people, and the 1% of people in the audience might be a hundred thousand dollar people, and you're leaving 90 grand, per unit on the table. So the difference between these things is exponential in the outcome of the, of the business, right? ## Maximizing Client Value through an Ecosystem Approach **Summary:** Instead of focusing on individual sales, build an ecosystem where clients can naturally find their value level. This involves conceptualizing revenue buckets and facilitating client ascension based on their needs and willingness to pay. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So if we have ways and lenses to look at maximizing client value, then the clients will settle in their natural place relative to all the different factors, and timing is a huge one as well. Right, desire to pay, levels of access, how much they value proximity to you or your team, or whatever your setup is, and how fast they ultimately want to go

. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So if we have ways and lenses to look at maximizing client value, then the clients will settle in their natural place relative to all the different factors, and timing is a huge one as well. Right, desire to pay, levels of access, how much they value proximity to you or your team, or whatever your setup is, and how fast they ultimately want to go. So I've started looking at client relationships in the, in the, not in terms of interpersonal relationships, but in terms of value based relationships where a value transfer happens between information and access and money through the lens of annualized value. So that allows us to create an ecosystem. When, after we make the first sale, we put the effort into making it easy to start and easy to get going. Then the client can find their natural place in our ecosystem because we've built it in such a way. So we can do this by conceptualizing revenue buckets that clients can fit into in the process, and that makes filling up these buckets natural. Do not, I think my drawings getting worse, not better. I think, I think I need to take some iPad pills or something, but do not get hung up on the numbers, understand it as a concept, right? And so when we're looking at, when we're looking at revenue buckets, the earlier you are in the journey, and I've put, I've put constraints on this in terms of bounds of a million, 3 million, 6 million. The earlier you are on the journey, the narrower and smaller you want those individual buckets. So we start from, if you're looking at on a scale in the middle. So we have a small number of buckets that we fill up with ultimately with clients. We can do that with a singular offer. We can do that with the hybrid offer plus a couple of things that I'm going to talk about to ultimately fill up those buckets to keep it simple. The, the larger the business and the larger your goals and the larger the scale you achieve, the more you have to expand those buckets. Right? I'm now exploring the outer bounds of this concept where I have clients who, who are exceeding a hundred thousand dollars annualized value, and I am being forced to come up with ways to serve them and the desires and the problems they have. Right? So that is client driven.

right? That is client driven by solving 20 problems along the way to get there. So they had that problem, and then they are now stretching the annualized value that, that they can ultimately achieve, and I can ultimately capture. So the earlier you are in the journey, the less buckets you want, and the smaller and the more concentrated those buckets are because you just want to fill them up. So one or two tiers is, is ultimately optimal, and I'm going to give you examples in a minute to, to show how this plays out in the, in real, the hybrid. Does that, right? So simplicity scales, and the less offers you have, the more that the offer has space to be optimized. ## Growth vs. Scale on the Path to $1 Million **Summary:** On the path to a million-dollar business, prioritize growth through experimentation and iteration. Once you have a proven offer with a high conversion rate, shift to a scale phase focused on volume. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** I've talked again a lot about the difference between growth and scale. On the road to a million dollars a year, which everybody is capable of, then you are spending much more time in growth than scale. Growth is, the metaphor is throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, right? That is how optimization happens. It happens through experiments and action and repeated actions and reps, right? In a growth phase, you never stop moving because you're always learning and iterating and trying to remove the pieces that aren't working. And then once you hit an inflection point of, I have things that work, I have an offer that when I send to people, 30% of people buy it, then you can be in a scale phase where you feed people into that and you're looking for volume. On the, on the journey up, those scale phases don't last for very long until you, you will hit a constraint or a bottleneck of diminishing returns and whether the offer or something needs slight engineering or tweaking to keep, to optimize, to ultimately grow. And those are the points where a lot of people stall out, and you'll hear people saying, "I'm stuck at X revenue. I'm stuck at this." And it's because they haven't switched from a growth phase to a scale phase, or they think they're on a scale phase, but they're in a growth phase, and they need to re-engineer the offers or some of the finances towards the marketplace. ## The Hybrid Offer and Client Value Ascension **Summary:** Use a hybrid offer and a stacked ecosystem to reveal potential ascension paths for clients. This allows clients to naturally find their value level within your ecosystem, leading to higher average client value and retention. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So how does it play out? That, that plays out in a reality that on day one of a relationship with a client, it is difficult to discern, truly discern whether a client is a thousand dollar person or a hundred thousand dollar person. The only way we, we discern that is by showing them the path to do so, right? And then the thousand, thousand, probably in hindsight, it's a bit extreme of an example. You can discern, roughly what bucket they're in, but, if you can't tell between a thousand, a hundred thousand dollar person, then there might not be enough signals to go on. So we use the hybrid offer and the stack, we can show people the potential path forward. So what I have done and what I have experimented with and nailed in my own business, and then helped people apply, is I have very power law based experience because the next step for people is always natural, so that has led to very, very high average client value

. So we use the hybrid offer and the stack, we can show people the potential path forward. So what I have done and what I have experimented with and nailed in my own business, and then helped people apply, is I have very power law based experience because the next step for people is always natural, so that has led to very, very high average client value. And that's also led to very high retention because I have a myth, a methodology which allows people to naturally move forward to the place that they need to be, but also naturally move backwards to settle at a level without them ultimately leaving a community or a product or, etc. And saying in other ways, I've worked out how to get the most amount of money out of clients while delivering, out of clients for delivering the maximum result. And I've also worked out a way to pretty much ensure that most people don't leave because they have something for them. So scenario one, a common scenario: They join the community, they pay in full off the back of, an offer, they enjoy the experience, I credit that experience against the syndicate, and they step up into it. I credit the full experience. I work out a custom payment for them based on the credit, so they're not paying the full amount. They feel that they've got a credit, which is again potential energy in there, and they step up into the syndicate, and they're on a lower payment than they would be at a market rate, and they've got that natural experience. That is a very common flow, just by crediting what someone has previously purchased against the next step. Right? And I'm in the process of engineering that across the board in the business to make that natural. So anybody, no matter how long they've been in there, can benefit from, from that progress in that state, so they can settle in their naturals, in their natural place. That also, this also means that in the inverse, that someone could join the syndicate for a period of time and step back down to the community because under the, the nature of that offer, they might spend 3 months in the syndicate, and then they step down, and they've still got, 9 or 8 months, in the community, and they're still ultimately there and part of it. Right? ## Leveraging Small Initial Investments for High Client Value **Summary:** By strategically structuring your ecosystem and crediting previous purchases, you can transform small initial commitments into significantly higher value client relationships. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So this is another scenario that's played out. And so that, that scenario there has an annualized value of about $20,000 for a person if they stay for the whole duration of that. that's the, the actual ultimate example. Bear in mind, the first touch point that that person had when joining my world was they were probably attracted by someone, something that said, "Join for a hundred dollars." So I have taken that commitment or that interest of a figure around a hundred dollars and then established that the client will spend $20,000, right? There's an order of magnitude different in the actual client value. And this is why we isolate that when we look at offers, we isolate the ability to convert someone versus having an ecosystem that they step into where they ultimately expand. There are plenty of people who have gone through the classic ascension from me, who have downloaded a free lead magnet, bought a $10 book, joined $100 a week community, and then ascended all the way up to the Circle at $800 a week. So again, same scenario, client joins the community, then moves between levels based on how much proximity and access they need at the time. And again, this is a real scenario

. There are plenty of people who have gone through the classic ascension from me, who have downloaded a free lead magnet, bought a $10 book, joined $100 a week community, and then ascended all the way up to the Circle at $800 a week. So again, same scenario, client joins the community, then moves between levels based on how much proximity and access they need at the time. And again, this is a real scenario. One of my one-on-one clients finished this week, and as, dropped back down to a level that we both agree is right from after, a 10 week period of, of one-on-one. So joins the community, goes to the syndicate, goes to the circle, opts for a period of one-on-one, then comes back to the circle, right? So we ultimately have, someone who is worth $51,000 across 52 weeks because we have places to take them and places to go. Two different examples, four people at two different distinct stages. But ultimately, if we look at an ecosystem where we're looking at annualized value, and then our offers naturally fit together, what we stand to do is, is find the maybe half a dozen clients who are currently paying a few hundred or a few thousand dollars and establish that they are, they have a propensity to pay there, of a willingness to pay, and they have a desire for speed or something to be done right now that transforms them into 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or $50,000 relationships. In my experience, in a client, in a, in a cohort of clients, if you've got 10 of them, one of those people is probably prepared to pay a hundred times more than they're currently paying. And so having an ecosystem and understanding that is a dramatic change in the business because the power laws are extreme, absolutely extreme., I'm knocking on the door of 40 people who have contributed half my revenue this year. And if you look at the whole client base, that isn't 80/20, that isn't 90/10. It's somewhere in the region of 94/6 or something that as a power law ratio., 6% of the clients are ultimately contributing half the revenue. It's, it's not even close to linear, right? ## Practical Steps for Implementing an Ecosystem **Summary:** Communicate your various program levels early and often, making them real in your marketing and content. Crediting previous investments towards future purchases injects potential energy into the system, encouraging client ascension. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So in terms of, today's not intended to be too practical, it's, understand the principles behind it. But a practical piece is engineering. This is rooted in displaying the levels early and often. Again, what you've seen me demonstrate is I talk about my client programs a lot. I make them real, and I make them thing, I make them real in my marketing, in my content. I make them real inside the communities, and I make people aware that they ultimately exist. And if I display the levels early and often, it means people have an understanding of the ecosystem and that they can either move upwards and get more access to me, but also move downwards for, at, at different times. So simply, the more I communicate it and the more I talk about the different programs and those things and reference them and, and, and, even talk about them in, in a, in a semi mechanistic way, clients know there are different levels inside, and it makes that upgrade or that downgrade conversation very easy and very natural without any tension and without any fear of losing anything, or fear of being sold to as well

> "I will credit all previous investment that you've got against this next thing,"
, you are writing a check and putting it in their hand, right? Money and credits are potential energy. The, you'll see this happen this month at Christmas time when those people who are impossible to buy for, or children who live miles away from their grandparents, get gift cards. When my kids get gift cards for something, they are stored up potential energy, 
> "I want to go to the shop and spend. I want to go. I want to go. I want to go,"
 right? They have potential spending power that they have been given, and they want to use it. My children are not alone in that. Adults also do that where the potential energy that you can still, that you can give people by giving them a credit for their previous investment is stored up and allows them to use it. Some will use it immediately, and some will store it up well into the future. I have hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential energy stored up across my customer and client base that will just slow, that slowly be deployed. It was deployed yesterday. I credited against a 5K experience. I credited 2,400, and they paid 2,600, right? Potential energy stored up and, and then is utilized, which then creates more cash flow into the business. ## Offer Structure for Different Revenue Goals **Summary:** For a $1 million goal, one offer with two levels and a clear ascension path is sufficient. As revenue goals increase, develop a front-end offer and an inner circle for a larger client base. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So what do we need? On the way to 1 million, we need one offer with two levels, right? And then if you have, have a, a simple ascension between those two levels, and potentially, extras with that people can purchase hours, or done for you, or anything that as a one-off, then you have everything you need to get to that milestone. As we expand into higher revenue levels, we need a higher, a higher degree of conversion out of the audience. So we need to develop a front-end offer, and we need to develop some inner circle once our client base exceeds 40 to 50 people. Again, I'll talk about the exact things and, and the plan next week that these, this is the principles behind it. ## The Importance of Gratification and Managing Expectations **Summary:** Business growth is not linear, and our tendency towards instant gratification can lead to disappointment and quitting. Manage expectations by focusing on the process and understanding that results are a lag indicator of accumulated behavior. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** I've been thinking a lot, as in over the course of years, about why some people get results and some people don't, and some, and why also the phenomena of people who get results quit along the way because they're dissatisfied with the result they're getting. And it all came back to that, the idea of gratification and in the course of doing things, in the course of executing on something or working on something, and the more obsessed you are with something, the more you value the return from it, and you need feedback from it. And again, the map is, is not the terrain. The math of achieving different revenue levels is easy to write down. Right? I can, I can put math on a page and point to that and go, 
> "Go in, just do $2,739 a day. Go, just go and do it, right, that's it. And you'll do a million dollars a year,"

# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 2

## The Insight Funnel & High-Tier Offers show how. Show the working show how you transform something, how you change something. Show the steps that that person took to do it and show as much behind the scenes as you possibly can. These are not testimonials. They're case studies. Testimonials are, hey? It was great to work with him, and it was great to work with her, and it was wonderful. And it's changed my life. These are these the steps this person took? Then we're giving them the offer. The the rule of thumb in an insight funnel is we start high. So we start with our highest tier offer because the economics in a lead based funnel mean that we have to convert at the highest possible economics. So I lead these days with a conversation about one to one, or working for the sovereign circle, because it is an easier conversation to that. And then, if that's not a fit, 5 where they are with me, with finances or their current position in the market. Then I'dinvite them to the syndicate. So that path, if we look at a funnel is Big Idea Video, we're taking them through there. We're giving them the offer. We're offering them our highest tier plan, and then we're downselling them into the into the middle tier. So the insight funnel is, very much straightforward. You put traffic through it again. It can be used equally effectively in in an organic environment as it can to to running ads to it. If you're running ads, I'll add some components later on, which show how you can choose between offering., a gated insight video. So a video where people have to, you know, put an email address in or not. Some of those, some benefit from having a gate, and some don't. I prefer these days to run, big ideas or Vsls very much ungated, so people can consume the info and get insight as quickly as possible. show how.

## The Customer Funnel (Low-Ticket) The the second piece is, the customer funnel, and, for all intents and purposes it's just a low ticket funnel. It's just a low ticket funnel, but. a lot of them, the devil is in the detail. So . Step one is obviously you need to run traffic to it. Low ticket funnels, unless you have gigantic, enormous audiences need large amounts of traffic to them, because the the net levels of conversion on the front end to make the economics work just need a lot of eyeballs. And so the the ads these days, there's lots of different forms. I still. I still maintain a few people disagree. I still maintain a long form and a story based ad will work pretty well. Some of the economic, some of the cost per leads, etc, in my, in my Facebook account right now, justify that where a long form story, based Ad. Especially on in Facebook land, still works pretty well to get capture attention and convert it. In the other forms that we have now of consumption. stories and and vertical video. And these things, then does what it says on the tin ads, get this for $9. Get this for $5. This is what's inside it. Work extremely well, because they're very snackable and clickable. So people know what they're clicking on because it says it on there. how to get high ticket clients without sales calls $9. It's very much it does what it says on the tin.

## Ad Creatives & Audiences The other thing that I've tested with some results, even though it's It's a little bit all over the place, in terms of which ones work. And what creative work is, I've taken, opus clip, or one of those, clip chopping services, and use the shorts from the product. So the hybrid offer, for example, has . a 2 h long workshop with it. I chuck it in into the into the tool. I get the shorts back, and I use some of the shorts as ads. Most of them are wildly out of context because they're from the middle of a training. But some of them also get traction and work to convert, and purchases audiences go big, run, run a big, open audience for the countries that you that you want to target run interests and run warm as well for landing page viewers, for viewers and followers, etc. having those 3 there, you will dial in with the different content types and and find it increasingly. It's a creative game rather than audience game. Once you find the audiences that work, you feed them, very good amounts of creative, probably these days assisted with AI creative in terms of, that does what it says on the tin imagery. And the low ticket offers. So the concept of the Dcm. too, came from me going? Well, I've got a product. I've got a video that says, the same stuff. It's the same ideas. It's the same, it's the same original Google Doc, that started the book that then I can then talk to.

## Repurposing Content for Different Buying Types Why don't I just present them in 2 different ways to for 2 different buying types. So it's fair to say that the big idea video is just the book in video form in terms of consumption. And that's why the the core of the funnel. The same idea can be present in both places. People are just going to consume it in different ways. One way is, the free path. They're going to watch a video. And another way is them investing and buying. the media that goes with it. So within that we've also got sub products. the the hybrid offer for me and and the trainings that the training that goes in there in the template has worked particularly well in the top of funnel. The components that need to be there are pretty straightforward again the headline drives, most of the activity. And then, as we've gone along, we've called out different people, coaches, consultants, agency owners who sell high ticket services. Give it some credibility exactly what's in it. Give it a guarantee, give it an FAQ. Put some testimonials on the page, but that's only after we've proven the market wants it. and, as I always say, use an asset. You've already got to deploy into a low ticket funnel. The one of the major mistakes are giving too much in the front end. what's the rule of one. It's clear they get one valuable thing from the purchase for me. It's clear that they get a template that they can use immediately, even if they're not using it. They have a tool in their toolkit that they that they get access to immediately that they can see how someone else is doing it.

## ## Low-Ticket Offer Strategy Templates Pdfs Books

## Low-Ticket Offer Strategy Templates Pdfs books. They work, in the one to $10 range bundles of trainings or bundles of templates, or, or, bundling multiple things together. 15 to $30. Live workshops perform particularly well. especially if you've got somewhat of a warm audience, 25 to 100 based on your marketplace. And you're aiming for, an 8% front end. Conversion off that page. That's a that's a rule of thumb. Again, it depends on the economics, because the goal of an info funnel is always to get the advertising dollars back as much as you can. The the nice thing about this funnel and as a lot of people have found is that you can have multiple front end offers and then run everything else the same. So I have the same bump across all my front end, low ticket products the Cash campaign. It's complementary to the 1st purchase they make. So it converts very well that converts at over 70% at the moment. So you're aiming for a 50% conversion of the bump. My bump is $29, so it needs to convert at least over 50%. Some people have got good success with a., a $39 bump, and of course you need slightly. You don't need quite as much conversion to make that work. I'vealways found that bumps order bumps work best in the 24 to $29 range. Again, relative to the market.

---

## Implementation Steps

## Upsells and Membership Offers The upsell. Take something you've already got and sell it to them. The upsell purely exists to raise the average order value right? So I sell the 3 K code and the social code for $99. That's a big old bundle of training. There's something close to 6 h of stuff in there. To consume. So it's a big old chunk. I think there's a there's a reasonable hypothesis that slows down the purchase of people consume it. And so if you notice that you're you're getting a lot of upsell sales, but you're not getting a lot lot of back in sales, then your upsell might be, in the this is too good category. I've found that $99 works again. I've I've used upsells that, work at 1 99 as well, just just equally there. It purely exists to, increase average order value. Don't include too much stuff, don't include a 52 video course in there, as it will slow down the whole purchasing cycle. And you want 20% of people to convert it to convert into it. We can go here straight to a membership offer. We've got a customer there in motion. They're buying information. Let's make a hypothesis that they want more information. So I go straight to a membership coming in at 8, $50 a week, and then they they can come in at $50 a week. Try it out, cancel any time if they it. They stay. We're aiming for a 20% retention rate off the membership. We don't expect., many people to stay whatsoever, but it gets us customers, and ultimately we can upgrade those customers in the future., and once someone's in motion, and once someone's buying, we want to know what they're going to buy next. So, the obvious upsell for me past the membership is buying the syndicate, getting access to me. Excuse me. One thing that they tested early on that that has worked extremely well is that when I'm delivering the product that they've bought, when they've bought the hybrid offer workshop. They've gone through the funnel. If they haven't bought the membership. Then by the time they get to the training I'm offering them a trial. So I'm offering, and quite a few people here joined via that trial. So I've just got a passive call to action around the. And I've given you this template as well around the training that allows people to, join the trial. If they are consuming the training, they the training. Then saying. Hey, get more of this. That's a very. Congruent place to put it where they can trial the membership as they're consuming the product. The upsell. Take something you've already got and sell it to them.

## Benefits of the Dual-Mode Funnel So the the 2.0 funnel, is a is a dual mode we are generating leads. And we're also generating customers that as we go along, they, we, we need to optimize them based on the market. How many people are coming through as leads? How many conversations are you generating? How many customers are we generating, and at what value, and what are they buying right? So the immediate result is the and the 2.0 funnel is you get leads, customers and clients every day. Right? You're also getting future buyers and new customers and new clients at a high velocity much higher than nurture based funnels. So cash flow grows as the funnel dials in allowing you to scale marketing, spend faster than a traditional funnel in a traditional funnel. You've got to put leads in the top, have conversations. Wait till you get the client out the other side to understand what's the cost per acquisition, etc, etc. with a cash flow based funnel with a customer funnel complementing that we can generate cash every day and generate sales every day that feeds the whole system. So I found with these type of funnels running them in conjunction, you can scale them quicker because you are getting cash on the daily basis rather than having to wait 7 or 14 or 30 days to get a client out the other side and the other major byproduct is my list that the growth of my email list is predominantly made up of buyers these days. Right? So as my email list grows, I have more and more buyers. If I have more and more buyers on my email list, I get a higher response when I make an offer, because I've already got people on the list who are buyers. So the slow, steady, but, appreciable, compounding effect which most good things come from that compounds. Today. When I make an offer, I get a much higher response rate than it was than if it was made up from purely leads. I would much rather have a smaller list made up of buyers and customers than a large list made up of people who have just opted into something, and I've got the permission to communicate with. So the the 2.0 funnel, is a is a dual mode we are generating leads. And we're also generating customers that as we go along, they, we, we need to optimize them based on the market. How many people are coming through as leads? How many conversations are you generating? How many customers are we generating, and at what value, and what are they buying right? So the immediate result is the and the 2.0 funnel is you get leads, customers and clients every day. Right?

Right? So as my email list grows, I have more and more buyers

# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 5

with different people at scale who are joining programs or joining group are very very high right and the more variables you have of the people joining your program the more you have to have infrastructure that caters for those variables so a practical example is the more variables you have the more questions you need and the more customer support you need the more questions you get in your group on your calls etc etc so from an efficiency point of view I found that having a onetoone call with somebody and having and Catering for the variables there in that first instance especially if you're still in a growth phase of giving them the map but show them their terrain which is you've got this you've got this here are some three or four ways to accelerate the things you've already got so they're not going on a linear path is the highest leverage piece which is giving them the map which is the same map for everybody but helping them plot the terrain themselves so that condenses the customization and gets them results quicker because they can they can more use utilization some unfair advantages they've already got or assets have' already got or resources whatever it is and and get a get a much faster start but you've also got less support to go along the way because you've catered for most of the variables in the plan so I found that unless you're some running something really massive where you're signing up dozens or thousands or hundreds or whatever people a week then giving someone a plan at some level whether it's you or a coach or or someone you've got there or get getting them to fill in a plan and bringing it to a place where you can do it on mass and customize it yeah as the fastest way to condense that and give the most variables but while while still sticking to a plan that they can execute and you can support them on yeah so I want to go granular for a Program Curriculum second because how I see it is if you go to a Bad Doctor you present symptoms and they give you medication and they say oh you've got you feel this take this pill three times a day or whatever a great doctor will look at the foundations and the fundamentals right sleep nutrition hydration movement sunlight stress and then based on your needs once those things are taken care of and you've dialed in the fundamentals they give you supplements medicines whatever it might be to supplement right the foundational work that you're doing and so when someone comes into outworld for example there is the foundational curriculum that you don't have to go at through a through Zed but there are steps you have to go through before you start getting individualized prescriptions yeah right so it's you have to go through these modules so we we call it the first steps they go through is onboarding and Mastery so it's this is how you succeed in our world here are values this is the road map to 100 month profit then Mastery is about self-image setting goals all those types of things then we start to get individually prescriptive right if you've already got momentum and you're making money and you just want to tweak your offer great go here if you have a great offer and it's already converting in your s traffic great go here yeah and I think one of the things that people struggle with is holding tensions do I tell them what to do or do I create a buffet and they can choose their own adventure and the answer is both right and so I I I will State my strong opinion here I would love to know what you think I think most people and when I say most you would have to be the reare exception should either be doing the work for people or doing it with them I would say the the rare case is when you just teach people to do it themselves CU most people just don't have the skills or to create a curriculum and create an environment and hold a community culture to where it can be hands off so I think either you're you're providing a service yeah or you're doing one toone coaching yeah for me this whole idea of scale where people

most you would have to be the reare exception should either be doing the work for people or doing it with them I would say the the rare case is when you just teach people to do it themselves CU most people just don't have the skills or to create a curriculum and create an environment and hold a community culture to where it can be hands off so I think either you're you're providing a service yeah or you're doing one toone coaching yeah for me this whole idea of scale where people are in their first 10 15 20 clients and they're trying to hire a coach and have a community manager and have a client consur perf 12 videos that do exactly the same thing a thousand times even now I'll record a video and I'll think of 10 things I could have said better or things I didn't include and even at my level I'm still thinking about ways in which I can get better and ways in which I'm dropping the ball and going oh my gosh but but do you do you agree or how do that because I think so many people that the headline on the Facebook ad of stop stop Ono one coaching and start a group program I think is a really sexy promise I think too many people don't have the skills to go straight into group coaching straight into a leverage model I think you build programs around people rather than build them for them okay right which is I think we're saying the same thing you you are a service provider so you get in there and you solve problems and your skill levels go up to Pat and match how you solve those problems at scale so the evolution of your teaching I would guess your stuff is getting shorter and more refined and it's improving in that because you're getting better and the average length of my training videos over the years have gone that because I can say what I need to say used to take me 60 minutes and now I can do it an eight so it's the refinement down but I I don't make when people join my community I don't make them go through a lineer piece I customize every single person even when they join at 300 bucks a week right now price is going up five spots left don't wait the even even when they're coming in now I give every person a 30- minute call because I know that I can save eight weeks of them going through stuff and down into that that the next eight weeks are much more on their path and on their Journey Y and I get faster results and also people don't leave but the most important point I think here is that you haven't graduated from one toone One to One Coaching coaching you still do it I still do it I've added $40,000 a month I'm recurring Revenue in the last 3 weeks and it's all onetoone Consulting and so there's this fallacy that I see people believe that they're they do the hard yards of I'm doing onetoone calls and I'm doing the $130 an hour type things I did when I started and now we're experts and we're really good and we've graduated out of it but I think this whole idea is firstly it's crazy cuz people graduating far too early they don't have the skills they don't have the ability to communicate really succinctly clearly give people what they need they don't even know what people need and I think this whole idea of onetoone coaching and being really Hands-On is so interesting to me because I'm getting opportunities now where my hourly rate is $3 to $4,000 an hour right we have a unique tax situation so that's not only mostly profit it's mostly takehome and then I compare that to the $133,000 $13 an hour I was making 5 years ago the gap between here and there is thousands of hours of one toone coaching yeah so people go the trenches right that sounds amazing how do I create an offer around that it's well you probably can't because you don't

now where my hourly rate is $3 to $4,000 an hour right we have a unique tax situation so that's not only mostly profit it's mostly takehome and then I compare that to the $133,000 $13 an hour I was making 5 years ago the gap between here and there is thousands of hours of one toone coaching yeah so people go the trenches right that sounds amazing how do I create an offer around that it's well you probably can't because you don't have the skills and so I think there's just something to be said about creating business models that yes doesn't suck you're not I'm not spending 30 hours a week one to one coaching but I'll spend 5 to 10 hours a week oneto one with clients because number one it's really profitable people love buying onetoone it's its own unique mechanism in a lot of ways right having a onetoone coach but number two it makes me so good at what I do and I think there's just this crazy belief that people get to 10K a month and they did the hard yards of one to1 and now we're going to launch a course and that's going to get me to seven figure freedom and I'm just going to check into the community once a week and I just think it's bull crap it is but but those people are trying to get away from the pain they've already created M so they think that scaling themselves out of it is the way to do it right so they go well this thing is causing me pain which is one to one so therefore the thing that will provide relief from that pain is not doing one to one y and then the answer lies in a much more Nuance place somewhere in the middle of that is it it depends but when are you I always go back to leverage when are you going to deploy leverage yeah when are you what complexity of you gone through so your clients go through Simplicity right cuz that's Mastery you someone has to go through complexity because to get extraordinary results in anything you need to understand the complex variables that go into getting results of anything the body business relationships ever they're complicated machines and complicated systems someone needs to go through complexity and the idea that you can just package everything up and throw it at a client and go there you go work it out and I'll see you on Wednesday at a

. every week is is fiction unless you've done an extraordinary amount of hours before that to go listen 95% of people are going to get results by doing this so someone's got to go through complexity and if you're good then the leverage that you get from a 20 minute 30 minute one to one piece yeah will provide leverage to that client which is weeks and months yeah in terms of getting them back but you're rewarded for that if they're paying to stay around and the on a practical note How Many Hours the the nuances live within the terms onetoone coaching how many hours how frequently what are we covering on those one of the things that I did that I made a huge mistake on when I first started one one coaching as I had my one of my first clients I think was coaching client number three paid for a year of one to one coaching up front so I had 52 1our sessions did you make the did you did you offer it that it was once a week yeah yeah I did that that was a mistake oh it was a mistake but not only that he was rich so he didn't he didn't he didn't need the coaching no and that's another no one really does yeah yeah yeah but but the challenge was he was a wealthy investor and he wanted to share his knowledge and so I would jump on a call with him and I would I'm trying to fill out the hour it wasn't about an outcome it was just selling the deliverable right an hour I was teaching and then we would assign to-do list and then we get back to the next week I was hey did you do what we were talked about and he's no I didn't I'm how am I going to fill this hour I'm rehash same and then now all my onet to1 clients get two 30 minute sessions a week a month sorry and so that's every two weeks 30 minutes I teach nothing I answer no Q&A stuff we are working on high level strategic game plan stuff so the nuances are not just within skills and how advanced are you it's you can structure it differently to where clients are getting better results and you're not getting burnt out so when I had I got to 95,000 a month in profit in April of this year when I after I burnt everything down and I rebuilt with one to one with 31 to1 clients but that was only8 hours of coaching per week right to make over a million dollars run rate and profit so it's how you structure it as well so coming back to this this 100K a month plan that we're building for people now so 3 to four month thing dream outcome I would say more Hands-On than not and especially in the early stages build skills get really good at what you do become obsessed with helping people go through complexity so they can experience Simplicity how do you think about pricing because there's not a magic price it's not when we when we joined Sam we keep referencing him because obviously that was our shared history when we started out he had a $5,800 price point that then we all came out and did a $ 5800 5800 so it's so much more nuanced right depending on your skill and what you value your time at and all of that it's nuanced someone's group program could start at at $3,500 and that might be a great price point for them starting out you started out at 2500 other people should be double or triple that but how do you think about it in terms of putting together that core offer for people to be pricing it in such a way that it's do you look at competitors do you how do you think about that so I I pretty much exclusively use weekly pricing and it's a bit of a thing M around around my parts because it it it offers the lowest now number to get started you're presenting a low number relative to a low number relative to the high numbers that generally get presented on high ticket yeah so

but how do you think about it in terms of putting together that core offer for people to be pricing it in such a way that it's do you look at competitors do you how do you think about that so I I pretty much exclusively use weekly pricing and it's a bit of a thing M around around my parts because it it it offers the lowest now number to get started you're presenting a low number relative to a low number relative to the high numbers that generally get presented on high ticket yeah so I found that the the the easiest offers to to make and easiest offers to create are also the easiest offers to buy and an easy offer to buy is match with a price that's easy to say yes to so a few hundred bucks a week and got clients Who start at 100 and start at 800 relative to their to the market there in so I think I just with pricing it's an infinitely we could do 10 podcasts on pricing because it's infinitely nuanced andely perspective but the the the key things are for me are lower than now number to get started the priority is getting people started it's not it's not making profit necessarily on day one it's getting someone started and building a an LTV and building a long-term relationship with them yeah because it's hard to sell things you don't want to do it you you want to minimize the number of sales you make to the number of people you make by keeping them the longest possible time so I'm a big proponent of having pricing that makes it easy to get started for someone and that's that's obviously relative to the market and easy to stay easy to stay because if they're paying $300 a week because let's get into the nitty-gritty here right so it's Pricing someone's committing to a I can't do the math but $300 time 16 right what is that don't do public math 4,800 yeah 4,800 thank you thank you James so 4800 so what I would do is I I I if if you want to incentivize cash up front yeah the easiest way to do that is prepaid discounts in my experience right so if you're not in a season of stacking recurring Revenue but you're trying to stack cash because you're trying to get yourself out of a hole Yeah having prepaid discounts where it's it's 4,800 paid across 16 weeks or if you want to save 20% Which is $800 you can prepaid today and that makes it $4,000 it's the opposite of what most of the industry does which is they penalize people who go on high ticket payments it's the opposite way right opposite frame it's $4,000 or if you want to split your payments it's now 5,000 or 6,000 it's just arbitrary numbers you're penalizing poor people right it's oh you can't afford the full amount we're going to make it more for you so it's reverse it's not 4,800 by the way it's 4 4,400 embarrassing embarrassing and so so we got weekly pricing you can have a prepaid discount if you want cash up front what I do is at the end of 16 weeks let's say you can do a couple of things firstly this comes this is my experience is that it comes down your level of confidence if you have a killer program that's getting amazing results you can sell a longer time frame so the 16 weeks could enter into a 12 month recurring Revenue where the payments just keep going weekly or monthly or you can just resell in another rhythm of 16 weeks I don't when people go into a month-to Monon where it's truly open-ended it's do you want to keep working together in every month you don't know where these clients are staying so having a time commitment is strong but I really having a core recurring Revenue offer that you can just resell and resell and resell again and I am a few years into this with

Revenue where the payments just keep going weekly or monthly or you can just resell in another rhythm of 16 weeks I don't when people go into a month-to Monon where it's truly open-ended it's do you want to keep working together in every month you don't know where these clients are staying so having a time commitment is strong but I really having a core recurring Revenue offer that you can just resell and resell and resell again and I am a few years into this with clients where some clients have never made more than a six-month commitment and they're still here 3 years later so it totally works do it the same way in terms of going from one offer into the next CU by the way just to recap to clarify sorry these are not different offers this is not an upsell this is not a downsell this is a resell would you to continue to pay the same and experience the same level of coaching content and Community yeah that's how I do it I I we're fully on the same page with that and again it goes back to that selling once piece which is to get the transformation you want you know the dream outcome as you say it takes 12 months m in the next 16 weeks these things get done y right so they're committing to 16 weeks but they understand if they want the dream outcome they probably should be there for 12 months minimum y so I sell on two Dimensions the the time Dimensions is you're selling two time frames you're selling what happens first and then what can happen over the time frame but that's a pre it's the dream and the goal yeah right the war and the battle right yeah and then two Dimensions as well is how fast do you want to go mhm because the the the two Dimensions I sell is you can get started here for 300 bucks you get this much of me you get this this this that's enough for 66% of people but based on current numbers for the other 33% who who are in my world they're I want more access to you I want to buy hours with you I want a private sele with you so I have levels yeah that go faster let's talk about the levels well the other level that I'll go back to to the Daily client machine which is a methodology that I launched after Authority architecture that had two really distinct levels which was I'll help you write a book that you can turn into a sales funer they get you high ticket clients that was the whole premise of the daa client machine right the the course and the program of 5 grand the done for you was 50 right right so we' do we'd do the book for them launch the funnel etc etc you wrote people's books I forgot about that you're not just talking about the done for you of the selling it was so another I wanted to introduce that because another level for some people can be Services too yeah one to one services and those things but the the the point is there's power laws present in groups of customers right there is a a pretty decent cohort in most people's audiences who just want more access to you they want to go faster they want it done for them and I believe having an offer there that is multiples of the of the easy to enter $23 $400 a week piece is the fastest way to accelerate Revenue but also understand that there's different there's differing economics in your client base some people I've had people who only ever going to pay me 100 bucks and I've had people going to have pay me multiple six figures y so it's I I believe two Dimensions we're selling two dimensions of time yeah what gets done in terms of what did you say the goal yeah the the dream and the goal the Dream and the goal so sell the goal and then the dream yep and then two dimensions of this is everything that you get there's plenty there but if you want to go if you want to go faster go on the fast lane then then you can
