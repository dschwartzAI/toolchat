# business Framework

## Overview

The business is a comprehensive framework for business transformation.

## Complete Framework

The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.
There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We sign them up for an ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes and timelines along the duration.
Why People Buy
There are Four Core Reasons people buy help:
Make more money ● Save money ● Stay legal ● Live a better life
You only solve for one Core.
All other benefits are exactly that, benefits.
The difference between two companies:
Help business owners build business systems to free up time so they can make
more money (better life)
Help business owners build business systems to make more money so they can
have more time (more money)
Both businesses ‘do’ the same thing.
Yet both companies will attract a very different type of customer.
If you offer both as your core benefit both you and your client will be confused.
Personally I solve for making money.

# sending Framework

## Overview

I eventually automated the whole invitation and sending process via something I call The Cash Campaign but that story is for another day.

## Complete Framework

with a simple Google doc.
I eventually automated the whole invitation and sending process via something I call The Cash Campaign but that story is for another day.
It worked for one reason.
The offer and the 5 components it needs to contain.
Offers are everything. Up to $3m they ARE the business. One offer can do it all.
I've gone on to sell millions from plane old Google Docs using the 5 components.
Every time an offer flops for me I've skipped one of them.
I've put together everything I know about Offer creation and the 5 components in The Offer Code.
It takes you step by step through and gives you two templates to swipe and use yourself. Including the highest converting offer I've ever created.
The Offer Code is available until next Thursday for $100. A whopping $400 off the regular investment.
You can grab it here:

Tomorrow I'll be telling you about a special event I'll be holding for folks who pick up this training.
To your success
James 'offers' Kemp
Email 2:
An offer is the business.
Based on your replies yesterday: that hit home.
One great offer that's easy to buy, fun to sell and simple to deliver is all you need.

# exact Framework - Complete Guide & Key Framework - Complete Guide

# exact Framework

## Overview

I walk through this exact process of how we turn $100 customers to $15k inside Customers to Clients and give you my templates.

## Complete Framework

It's not them so much as their mindset.
Winning is resourcefulness and opportunity focus.
Losing is victim and problem focused.
And one of the principles of Customers to Clients, which is one of the trainings and templates included in the BF Bundle, is to use low ticket products to find great customers.
Then turn those customers into clients.
It works like a charm.
Demonstrating that you've got the goods while focusing on people who've signalled intent to improve by putting their hand in their pocket.
Lot's of people say they want something but until they commit then it's all talk.
But when someone puts their hand in their pocket then it's a signal of intent you can lean into.
I walk through this exact process of how we turn $100 customers to $15k inside Customers to Clients and give you my templates.
In the workshop replay there's also examples of other Syndicate folks killing it with this strategy. Of course that's included too.
C to C is inside the BF Bundle.

### 2. Practical Action Over Theory - Focus on what actually works in the market - Test everything, assume nothing - Results speak louder than credentials
### 3. The Power of Simplicity - Complex strategies often hide weak foundations - Master the basics before adding complexity - If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it

## Audience Segmentation & Lead Generation coming down from that. There are people who will invest intermittently. . They might buy a program here, an event here, a short coaching course, here a mastermind, and come into a free period and come out. Those people, are there. They are valuable to you, and you are valuable to them on the journey, and I see a lot of people going and talking, or being coached by one of my friends, and then coming back to me, and then going away again to do something else. And and they we don't have a linear path, but they are in my world for months and years. and then we have everybody else who will buy things spasmodically. They'll buy things occasionally, or they'll buy one thing and never buy another thing. But they might stick around in your audience, and there might be people who a big advocate of you I've got. I can think of lots of scenarios and people who fit these criteria. And so traditional lead generation has just been a game of large numbers, feed a thousand people on the top, nurture them while each one drops off. Get 30 clients at the other end if you could. and it's pretty wasteful, and it's pretty inefficient, and over time as we're seeing now. And a lot of people, especially if you're selling money or transformation fitness coaching as well. It's just harder because there's more people doing it. There's more, there's more cynicism, there's more blindness in the market, and it's just harder to to. It's harder to get clients. It's harder to capture attention. It's harder to differentiate. And over time no systems that waste most of their output have stood the test of time.

# controlled Framework - Complete Guide & funnel Framework - Complete Guide

# controlled Framework

## Overview

He emphasized the need for scalable and controlled systems to identify potential clients early and generate cash flow during growth.

## Complete Framework

Future buyers and customers captured early
Faster cashflow and marketing scale
31% of email list are buyers
Higher conversion rates on future offers
Enhancing Lead Generation Efficiency
James discussed the inefficiencies of traditional lead generation systems, highlighting that only 1-5% of an audience typically converts to clients, resulting in significant waste. He emphasized the need for scalable and controlled systems to identify potential clients early and generate cash flow during growth. James also explained different client types, from those investing in long-term coaching to occasional buyers, and stressed the importance of adapting strategies to the evolving market. He concluded that while traditional lead generation methods still work, they are not sustainable for long-term growth and need to be improved for better efficiency and scalability.
Unified Funnel Strategy Integration
James discussed his work on integrating two distinct funnel approaches into a unified strategy. He explained how the dual-mode client generation system can use non-client buyers to fund marketing efforts while targeting high-quality prospects. James outlined two main buying types: one focused on consuming information and deriving insight, and another on purchasing and consuming information. He emphasized that both approaches have their advantages and can be used together to create a more effective funnel system. James also touched on the importance of understanding the context around offers, including what happens before and after the offer itself.
Marketing Strategies and Content Optimization
James discussed various marketing strategies, including hybrid offers, daily client machines, and video-based content. He emphasized the importance of using a style that is native to the presenter and highlighted the significance of the headline in driving conversions for big idea videos and VSLs. James also explained the concept of insight funnels, starting with high-tier offers and downselling if necessary, and discussed the effectiveness of different ad formats for low-ticket funnels. He concluded by explaining the DCM (Daily Client Machine) concept and the importance of presenting the same core ideas in different formats to appeal to different buying types.

# No Framework

## Overview

No systems on earth that waste 97% of their output have stood the test of time.

## Complete Framework

The Daily Client Machine 2.0
How To Generate Leads, Customers and Clients Fast
Setting The Scene: Efficient Market Dynamics
Client serving businesses are set up to… serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace will not become a client. Over a long enough time period, clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. But efficiency is finding ways to shorten time periods.
Long sales cycles suck and are hard to scale.
Therefore, we must have efficient ways to identify who is most likely to become a client as early as possible.
Plus, it’s useful to generate cashflow from those who will never become clients in efficient ways.
Traditional Lead Generation
Traditional lead generation and acquisition is a game of large numbers.
Feed 1,000 people in the top.

“Nurture” them while each one slowly drops off.
Get 30 clients out the other end—if you’re good and lucky.
There are numerous issues with this approach. It works when the cost of generating a lead is low enough to waste 97% of the product of a system.
No systems on earth that waste 97% of their output have stood the test of time.
This approach only caters to one type of buying path.
The search for “the best” funnel is an endless one when the constraints are pre-determined.

Dual Mode Client Generation
The 2.0 approach deals with reality:
What we really want is clients, not buckets of leads.
We can use those who won’t immediately (or ever) become clients to fund our marketing
to get clients.
We can monetize IP we have already built.
We can shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness
prospects.
Dual Mode means we generate Leads and Customers at the same time using the same ideas.
We make information about our system freely available to consume, then funnel the attention into action.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction (i.e., get someone to give you money).
To get money, you must gain attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Two Buying Types
We need people to consume our ideas (and us) to buy into them.
The key word is consume.
One path a buyer can take:
Consumes information
Derives insight on how it could work for them
Takes the next step and puts the insight into action
The other:
