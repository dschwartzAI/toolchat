# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 4

. James Kemp: It's healthy to. It's healthy to follow urine. I'm, I know, the book works and things haven't magically changed. So we're gonna we're just gonna put it on the shelf for a bit and then come back to it. James Kemp: And then, when the algorithm, gives you the gift James Kemp: and it works in the 1st few days, then it keeps going, and then you can feed it with creative. James Kemp: But it needs to. It needs something needs to happen in the 1st 72 h. James Kemp: Otherwise you just may as well pull it all down and start again. Adam Franklin: Right? Okay, so don't keep persevering. If there's not much traction in those 1st 3 days. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, just give it a rest. Come back with maybe some different angles and different creative. James Kemp: . And and I'm talking about offers that you that, work or should work, and. Adam Franklin: Has it worked with your list? James Kemp: They've worked before, or someone else has got them working right. James Kemp: there are. There's an offer out there that's yours. James Kemp:, with a slightly different twist on it that, and it's been running for a long time, and you go and look, and that the ads are months old or those things. And you're, Okay, I can get that working. James Kemp: You're just looking for the angle James Kemp: mine. The hybrid offer especially needed James Kemp: needed a frame of who it was, for before it would really James Kemp: catch right? It was working. James Kemp: but I didn't have the. This is for these people. This is for coaches is for consultants is for agency, and as soon as that was in the, in the copy and in the framing. Then the cost per the cost per acquisition dropped a lot and the the funnel was working. It's just the the acquisition was a little bit too high to go too far James Kemp: while while the while the actual funnel is working. So it just need a little frame of who it's for. Adam Franklin: And so that's where you landed on coach consultant agency owner. James Kemp: Yeah. Adam Franklin: Okay. James Kemp: You were James Kemp: You are going to spend money testing. Adam Franklin: Yeah. James Kemp: Right. Adam Franklin: And what's a reasonable amount if something looks at 50 bucks a day? Is that a reasonable amount in your experience, or should it be higher or lower. James Kemp: I think you could. James Kemp: I start with $500, but I can do that right. I don't think that thinking in a daily in a daily James Kemp: way is particularly healthy because it's arbitrary. James Kemp: I I the frame of. James Kemp: If I set this $2,000 on fire, would it materially affect me? James Kemp: And if the answer is no, then that's how much you should spend on testing your funnel. Adam Franklin: Got it over. What timeframe would you say so? It's say it's an arbitrary $1,000 or $2,000 that you're prepared to test. James Kemp: Yeah, I'm gonna spend. I'm gonna spend 3 weeks doing this. I'm going to spend $2,000. And then at the end, I'm going to see what happens. I would have learned something. I would have looked at everything along the way. Adam Franklin: Okay. And that's something that you tend to do yourself. Or do you have a agency or a partner that that looks over. James Kemp: I'll always get a funnel going myself

. I'm gonna spend 3 weeks doing this. I'm going to spend $2,000. And then at the end, I'm going to see what happens. I would have learned something. I would have looked at everything along the way. Adam Franklin: Okay. And that's something that you tend to do yourself. Or do you have a agency or a partner that that looks over. James Kemp: I'll always get a funnel going myself. And then nowadays the creative demands of James Kemp: The creative demands of the funnel are just something I don't want to deal with. So I get someone to take over. And, media buying these days is James Kemp: moved away from which audiences do you choose to. How much creative can you feed it into the right audiences? James Kemp: So you need someone who's going to produce reasonable high level, we're we're launching new ads every Monday. Adam Franklin: Right? Adam Franklin: Are you finding Facebook and Instagram, or the platforms? Or do you go broader than that in your own personal experience? James Kemp:, Meta is, Meta has just got James Kemp: unlimited amounts of people to to go to. Right? Yeah. And so James Kemp: the creative requirements are still relatively low. You can do static ads with text. You can do video. So Youtube and those those platforms just have a higher creative requirement and a higher and a higher learning curve for most people. James Kemp: So those require more investment. Adam Franklin: Okay. Adam Franklin: And then the resources you put in the in the in the Google, Doc, I don't suppose you could copy that link in again, or I can just wait for the for the replay. But those you said you did do it in high level are those Adam Franklin: pages and templates that you've shared? Are they snapshots we can install? Or do we just go in and and replicate them ourselves on our end? James Kemp: That's a that's a snapshot you can install in Ghl. Adam Franklin: Oh, great, fabulous! Thank you!

## Q&A: The Importance of Differentiation & Creativity James Kemp: The the creative. We've talked about this a bit. And, office hours and the circle calls this week is the creative requirement. Adam Franklin: And these categories and the businesses that we're in. James Kemp: Isn't just the things people look at and images and those things. It's creative. Requirement is is differentiation. James Kemp: Bye, the barriers to entry in almost every James Kemp: coaching, consulting agency services category have just dropped into the floor. James Kemp: Anyone can do and say whatever they on the Internet. And this means that people have James Kemp: fatigue on a lot of different levels. They have offer fatigue, they have face fatigue, they have idea, fatigue. James Kemp: and the the crazier you are the easier it is now, because you will James Kemp: see and do, and feel and say and present things that other people don't have access to, and James Kemp: the one of the declines in performance of advertising is because the speed to copy everybody else is just ramped up to infinity. Right as soon as you launch something good. If people are watching you, someone else will launch almost the identical thing. James Kemp: and that will James Kemp: it does. It has a dual. It's a duality it educates the market. And so maybe it's good, but it also induces fatigue in the market because they're seeing the same idea. James Kemp: said the same way by different people. And they people just get blindness right? James Kemp: And so the creative requirement James Kemp: that the burden on all of us now is to be different right? And the irony James Kemp: is that the more time you spend in places this, the more time you spend looking at what your friends, colleagues, peers, competitors, and those things are, are doing, the harder it is to be creative. Adam Franklin: And. James Kemp: Over over time for me. James Kemp: My best ideas have come from adjacent markets, or taking b 2 c ideas to b 2 b, or taking concepts, and one plus one equals 9 by taking concepts from different places and introducing them into the marketplaces and the places you operate in. James Kemp: which is all to say. James Kemp: The more you try and follow. James Kemp: I understand. That's why I always try and present the principles and the thinking behind these things rather than just. This is what to do. James Kemp: Because if you just stick on, the this is what to do, and these are the tactics. And this is what to say, and those things James Kemp: that it won't work by default because James Kemp: everybody else is saying it, and everybody else is doing it, and everybody else is saying it in exactly the same way. James Kemp: and James Kemp: some of the measures that people have to take, especially sensitive people who absorb everything and are looking at what everybody else is doing. James Kemp: Some of the measures that people have to take to deprogram themselves from of doing the same thing in the same way, and saying the same stuff, and then getting annoyed that it doesn't work are extreme. James Kemp: So we do, which is all to say, understand the principles, follow the the pattern, but introduce James Kemp: your own process to it. Your own, essence to it, and and those things, and James Kemp: I'm increasingly reluctant to James Kemp: in many ways give scripts. And what exactly do I say in this? And what exactly do I say in that? James Kemp: Because if I'm giving them to 100 people at once. James Kemp: I'm just further perpetuating there their James Kemp: the the averageness, because that's that's what it returns to in the mean

## Q&A: Identity vs. Outcome in Marketing Adam Franklin: Are you still finding that it's the identity that people are Adam Franklin: buying into as well when it comes to, offers the identity that they can become more so than the the skill that they're acquiring, or the specific outcome that they're acquiring? Adam Franklin: Or is the identity part of tied into it baked into it, but less explicit. James Kemp: I think this is where the depth of power laws is much deeper than how much money people will give you, and how much they'll invest James Kemp: is is what's their transformational type? Right? James Kemp: There are. James Kemp: There are a tiny number of people. James Kemp: but proportionately in each category. Who are, we'll invest into transformation based James Kemp: programs and engagements and coaching and true mentorship James Kemp: because they understand proximity is how James Kemp: changes my name. Who am I around what environment I'm in, not, what am I being taught? James Kemp: There's is a very large cohort of people who are still stuck James Kemp: in the information age. Right? If I just get more information and buy more information. Then I'll have some breakthrough James Kemp: right? James Kemp: And so the nature of how people buy and why they buy James Kemp: hasn't really changed. Just our ability to differentiate between those people has. And this is where it's useful to understand what you're selling to people. James Kemp: A lot of people don't want coaching and don't want new skills. James Kemp: They just want to be plugged in James Kemp: to the matrix and just given all this stuff. James Kemp: There's a there's a a number of people who James Kemp: can't not do it, and they will buy transformation and coaching and masterminds. And James Kemp: that's just what they do right. James Kemp: I don't really care who is in a mastermind. I care who's in it. James Kemp: I don't care who what I'm going to be taught. I care who I get to hang around, and who I get to be near, because that's where the that's where true transformation happens or true insight happens. James Kemp: So yeah, I think there's James Kemp: there'll be. There's a return in many ways, memberships, James Kemp: masterminds, and people who understand proximity, and people who don't, who'll buy info James Kemp: identity is and mature markets, and or will always transcend James Kemp: strategic or or outcome-based promises over time, because James Kemp: how many times have you seen James Kemp: make a hundred KA month? James Kemp: How many times have you say 19 KA month? James Kemp: How many times have you seen that it to the point where it loses all meaning. James Kemp: and so identity, and who someone who someone becomes will transcend that over the long, over the long term? James Kemp: Who do you want to be. Adam Franklin: As sorry Adam Franklin: that identity is more more than just about the dollars. Is it. James Kemp: Always. Yeah. James Kemp: Molester. Adam Franklin: Cool. Adam Franklin: Thank you. James Kemp: Yeah, the money and different types can always be used, as, helps to get attention. James Kemp: But over over the long term. James Kemp: the underlying question that most people have is, Who will I become if I, if I James Kemp: put my beliefs into this and and ultimately invest in it. Adam Franklin: Thank you.

## Implementation Steps

## Q&A: Workshopping a Product Idea (DCM) James Kemp: Hi, Tom. Tom Rolley: Hey, James, how's it going. James Kemp: Good. Tom Rolley: I was wondering if we could workshop a potential product through the Dcm Tom Rolley: and just see how you'd approach that. So the, it's a workshop recording. It was called Map your custom journey, and the purpose was to identify the constraint in the business so that they would know which thing to fix Tom Rolley: so yeah, just wondering how you'd approach that from A from this? Dcm, where do I? Where do I start? What do I build. How do I? How do I look at it to get it up? And running. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have. James Kemp: So do does the target market know what a customer journey is. Tom Rolley: Oh, gee, maybe. But probably not Tom Rolley: they. Yeah, I'm guessing they probably they're probably just overwhelmed with the amount of stuff going on in their business, and they probably wouldn't recognize that those words. James Kemp: So in the in the realm of the customer. What's the primary problem that they want solved today? Tom Rolley: I think, they're probably they're they're looking for either, increased profits or increased revenue. And then they're not sure what they're trying lots of things, but nothing much is working. And they're just unsure about what even the problem is is most likely. James Kemp: Exactly. James Kemp: That market category isn't good for info products. They're good for insight. James Kemp: Right? Once you catch their attention, you can, show how how to work those things out. And how do you get your top 3 priorities and get them a plan? James Kemp: But they're not good, for info James Kemp: info is good for people who already have James Kemp: something that they feel they need to solve. They're just looking for the the mechanism to do it. Tom Rolley: Okay. So hence, if they don't know what a customer journey is, then it doesn't make any sense for them to to. James Kemp: So the way to frame a customer related journey thing is how to get. James Kemp: how to get the the template, to send to your customers today to get 81% back into your business in the next 30 days. Right? James Kemp: Because they've the the repeat business. The instant. Repeat business, template. James Kemp: how to send this, get clients. James Kemp: get money, etc. It's easy. It's, Okay. James Kemp: I want more repeat business. So I'm going to buy this, so I can use it straight away. Tom Rolley: Okay? And and that's the insight one rather than the. James Kemp: That's an info . Tom Rolley: That's the info. Okay, cool. James Kemp: With with the hybrid offer. I'm saying to people, you're selling an expensive thing on the telephone right now take this template. Put the thing you're selling into into this and sell it without the call. James Kemp: And they're, because they're they've got the thing they've got the offer. James Kemp: and they've got. They're they're running a process that they don't . James Kemp: They're doing sales calls. Tom Rolley: Okay, so where do I take that for the for this customer journey thing, should I just Tom Rolley: throw it in the bin. James Kemp: Element of the customer journey

. James Kemp: And they're, because they're they've got the thing they've got the offer. James Kemp: and they've got. They're they're running a process that they don't . James Kemp: They're doing sales calls. Tom Rolley: Okay, so where do I take that for the for this customer journey thing, should I just Tom Rolley: throw it in the bin. James Kemp: Element of the customer journey. It sounds very high level rather than . Tom Rolley: So that the the outcome is they can see the each stage of their business, and then they can clear. They ordered it and go. Oh, okay, well, we're dropping off here. that that there was, 8 18 people going into a sales call and one sale being made, and they were expecting a 30%. And so it was clear that that was the broken bit. Tom Rolley: So what do they do about that about one of them that I do. James Kemp: What do they do? Tom Rolley: What do they do? Well, then, they it's been mixed up Tom Rolley: piece rather than fixing more leads or more advertising that it was, oh, this is this is the broken bit fix that. So they they knew which bit to fix rather than just. James Kemp: A good info product zooms in on that bit. It says if people aren't turning up to your sales calls or your sales calls aren't converting at more than 30%. Do this. James Kemp: A good info product zooms in on that bit. It says if people aren't turning up to your sales calls or your sales calls aren't converting at more than 30%. Do this. Tom Rolley: Okay. James Kemp: So it talks that a good info product talks to a known problem. Tom Rolley: Okay? All right. So they have to know the problem that they've got the problem first.st And then they're, Okay, cool. This, this is the solve. James Kemp: Yeah. Otherwise, otherwise, an info product is going to spend a lot of time trying to educate people James Kemp: on that. This is the problem rather than just buying it. James Kemp: So an info product works best on a market where the the knowledge of the problem is already there. Tom Rolley: Okay. James Kemp: An insight as different because that customer journey piece James Kemp: may work very well as an insight based video which, watch this. And then you'll analyze this, and then I'll help you with James Kemp: help you with fixing that problem. James Kemp: Okay, cool. Got it James Kemp: in terms of the . If you want to know how to use that specific thing. James Kemp: That's how you'd. That's how you'd utilize it. Tom Rolley: Okay, so that would be more the Vsl, the open Vsl piece that you discussed. Okay, cool. All right. Got it. James Kemp: And then framing it. James Kemp: how we get how we double the revenue from existing customer bases without getting any new leads and and spending money on marketing, or something that. Tom Rolley: So yeah, got it. Got it? Tom Rolley: Alright. Cool. James Kemp: Because. Tom Rolley: Thank you. James Kemp: An insight based funnel will by nature educate people about, talk to pains. James Kemp: talk to problems, present solutions, and then say, do you want to fix them. James Kemp: whereas info funnel is, you've got a problem. James Kemp: Here's something that solves that problem. James Kemp: I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. You've probably got another problem James Kemp: would

. Tom Rolley: Thank you. James Kemp: An insight based funnel will by nature educate people about, talk to pains. James Kemp: talk to problems, present solutions, and then say, do you want to fix them. James Kemp: whereas info funnel is, you've got a problem. James Kemp: Here's something that solves that problem. James Kemp: I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. You've probably got another problem James Kemp: would. I'll prove to you that I can solve that problem. Hey? Do you want help solving all these problems at once? We should work together. Tom Rolley: And daily client machine is only info, or Tom Rolley: is it inside as well, can you . James Kemp: The new way of doing it. you're delivering those things both of those things at once, because they complement each other. James Kemp: The old way of doing it was, generating a lead, then trying to liquidate the customer, etc. But you only get one buying type James Kemp: right. And my. James Kemp: I've got high level clients who have come through both paths. They've watched videos. They've reached out to me James Kemp: right. And then I've got people who just bought and bought and bought and bought until we had the conversation of, Hey, do you just want to stop buying stuff and work together James Kemp: same people, but the path that they came through was distinct in terms of who they were, how they bought, and some people flick between different buying types based on timing in different ways, and some people only buy that certain way. James Kemp: Alright. James Kemp: I know people who never ever buy info products. James Kemp: and they won't buy any high ticket that way. And I also people who will not get on a call won't talk to someone won't watch a video that's longer than 30 seconds, and we'll just buy info products all day long and then go. I'm going to hire you for this. James Kemp: Right? They're different buying paths. Tom Rolley: Okay. Cool. James Kemp: And if we only use one of them, then we're limited on. James Kemp: We're limited on a few fronts, and James Kemp: where we are in terms of marketplace and maturity. And those things. It's it's it's pretty difficult to James Kemp: to grow and scale things when you're James Kemp: when you're limited, not understanding the James Kemp: what, what what is taking place. Tom Rolley: Okay, cool, cool. Yeah. building for both of those buying styles Tom Rolley: and then not eliminating the other one. Tom Rolley: Yeah, cool. Okay. James Kemp: Anymore, for anymore. Tom Rolley: Siobhan's got her hand up. I don't know whether you can see that one, but. James Kemp: I cannot. Tom Rolley: It's just showing on mine. James Kemp: Got a question. Siobhan.
