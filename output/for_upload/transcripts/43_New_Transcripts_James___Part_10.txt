# New Transcripts James - Part 10

. I'll just come up with a new tactic. And that is good for the good people and terrible for the terrible people because you, you can't, you can't innovate. You can't innovate and outrun it fast enough 'cause the economics don't make sense. 'cause the tension has just got so expensive. Yep. Yeah. I think this is a huge lesson for everyone on this call. No matter your niche, no matter your offer. What I've observed in our pocket, in the market that I'm seeing playing out everywhere is the era of better is over. And the era of different is here. When we got started a few years ago, there were king kings and queens of the hill. It was undisputed. It was Sam Ovens was the best at helping people get started. And for a lot of people, he was the best at helping get people get to a hundred KA month. And it was hilarious., who, who here has ever created a $5,800 offer, right, James? Okay. So there's a, there's a, there's a handful of people here. The reason I ask that is because that was what Sam priced up level, and that was the price point he told everyone to price at, to get to a hundred KA month. And so when I first started in, in my coaching journey in 2020, with my own official program, the number one most common thing I saw over the next 18 months was everyone charged $5,800. In other words, there was a, there was a, a perceived best system, a best way of doing it. It was you ran ads to A VSL, you had a closer, you, you were optimizing for these really specific KPIs. And then you sold a $5,800 offer that was broken into six weeks with lifetime access and a call a week. It was this undisputed, for a lot of people, that was the only way, what we're seeing now, what I'm feeling more than ever is people really focusing on the values and vibes of the people they work with., I caught two minutes of Sam Oven's school video update the other day where they were talking about, everything happening in school. And I found this so funny. They said, yeah, we've changed the way that school games runs 'cause we were attracting way too many hustle bros. And I was, that's so funny that they're talking about that as a software company not going, oh, these guys were, doing something bad. It was, oh, they're not the people for us. And I was, A software company is saying that, that they're, yeah, of all the people that we would want to attract into curator community, we are not looking for the hustle bros. The probably the underlying theme is, they can go over to Wop or GHL, but what we're trying to cultivate here is different. And the encouragement for everyone on this call is this idea that the idea of best and better do not exist. This idea of an objective king, queen category, winner, it doesn't exist in our market. And so the more we try and play that game, the more we are guaranteed to lose. And every one of our markets, there's someone who makes more than us, been in the game longer, has more accolades, more client success stories. And the more you try to play that game, you will always find someone who's willing to outwork you out, sacrifice you let, has, has less morals than you, has less integrity than you when you commit to the different game. Oh, I'm no longer trying to be better than James. I'm trying to be damn Bolton all of a sudden abundance. I'm no longer trying to run an ad that's better than someone else's

. And the more you try to play that game, you will always find someone who's willing to outwork you out, sacrifice you let, has, has less morals than you, has less integrity than you when you commit to the different game. Oh, I'm no longer trying to be better than James. I'm trying to be damn Bolton all of a sudden abundance. I'm no longer trying to run an ad that's better than someone else's. I'm no longer trying to run a workshop or write a book that's better than someone else's or is the best. I'm simply trying to be better at self-expression, letting my convictions be felt, my values, the vibe of who I am come through in everything I do. And this idea of a personal brand, it's, it's obviously not a new idea. I believe in it more than anything. The fact that I could shut my whole business down today and I could start a brand new business in a different niche with a different offer, different prices, different deliverables, and I would have my first a hundred customers in the first week is a powerful feeling because that's the power of a brand. I've been asked for marriage coaching, parenting coaching, which is hilarious 'cause I'm definitely not qualified for either. But that's what happens when you start to connect with people at a deep level, is they don't just see you as Dan, the business coach that helps people get to a hundred K month. They see you as Dan Bolton human who has these values, these convictions, and maybe a life that people want to emulate or a little bit of a taste of. And I just think I'm so, so passionate about this because I think everything's become so much more abundant. The the playing field has never been more level. There is no category king or category queen of our markets. It truly is, you could have a sales conversation with someone and they might be looking at someone's offer who's cheaper or is better, quote unquote. But they will choose to work with you because of the type of person that you are, because of the values that you hold and the way that you resonate with them at a deep level. And I, that just makes me so damn excited. And I don't know if it's always been as true today. I I don't know if it's always been as true as it is today. I think the world is moving more and more towards that. I, I, I think it is as, as we've lost trust in, in general, as we have lost trust in what we are told from the top down, then it's inevitable that people look for different sources of truth down to the individual unit, which is who is this person? Who are they really? And not, can I trust them to give money, but can I trust them with to care for me? Yeah. Right. Because we're in the, we're not in the business of scaling, businesses where if we scale care, then we scale the business, right? Yep. And we're not in the education business anymore. We're in the infotainment business. So we need a little bit of info and quite a bit of entertainment for the right person. Yep. And we're not in the community business anymore. We're in the culture business. what culture are you building, creating, facilitating, and those things. So they're, they're just, they're just the trends and the, and the spectrum that just moves along as people go through it. But fame has always been the most efficient business model. Yeah. It's just got a shitload of trade-offs around it that, that, that potentially need to be managed. Yeah, a hundred percent. Should we talk about ai? I know you've been doing some stuff with it. I've been going deep

. So they're, they're just, they're just the trends and the, and the spectrum that just moves along as people go through it. But fame has always been the most efficient business model. Yeah. It's just got a shitload of trade-offs around it that, that, that potentially need to be managed. Yeah, a hundred percent. Should we talk about ai? I know you've been doing some stuff with it. I've been going deep., it's, it's obviously a topic on everyone's minds., I'll just preface this by saying I see the market, our, our community. Let's just talk about the people in this room. I imagine a lot of people are split, they're either not doing anything with it or they're doing way too much., I talk to clients sometimes and they have a very clear bottleneck in their funnel, and they're, yeah man, I've just been spending last week creating an AI bot that replies to people's comments on my Facebook post. And I'm, brother in Christ, that is not worth doing., this is not a problem to solve. And so I think, it, finding how to leverage this in such a way that it's beneficial that it moves the needle is very, very challenging. I feel I'm finding more of a sweet spot. What have, what have you been working on ai and more specifically, how do you, how are you thinking about it now for businesses ours? I'm, I'm thinking of rather than, the conversation around the AI reminds me of the conversation, and I'm old enough to remember this about marketing automation. When marketing automation first came out, and believe it or not, it hasn't existed forever. When marketing automation first came out, people were, I'm gonna automate everything. And what people did was they automated s****y process. So there's this, I'm gonna automate all these emails, but they were s**t emails. I'm gonna automate this, this, this web flow. But it was a, it was a s****y flow. And so AI's the same, is that it's only as good as the things you feed it, right? And so people have tried to delegate work to AI rather than taking the time to understand what work needs to be created. So I'll give you, I'll give you an example about how, how I think about it. If someone starts working with me, the, the, the, the central pillar of what we need is a, is a good offer, right? And a good offer is only the one that's validated and responded to by the marketplace., their marketplace in general. That in that initial time, if we're starting from scratch, or even if we're doing something that will take seven to 14 days to get something, unless someone's a hyper action taker, something that is market ready and valid, validation. So there's a lag time between getting in the market and, and learning that is just filled with work labor. The most important thing is if the market responds to it. So you've got a minimum viable offer that you need to put in the market and get a response from. We know that if we have best, even with best practices, we need all these things to do it. And then the market responds. So how I think about it, if an AI tool can get that MVP in five minutes rather than 10 days, then we spend the, the, the time that we have saved learning about the offer in the marketplace where, where, where it matters, right? We can sit there and f*****g go through the Google Doc and pick out words and those things we don't really know until it hits the market. Mm-hmm. We don't really, really know much. We've got a good guess, but that, that's the best as we can do

. Mm-hmm. We don't really, really know much. We've got a good guess, but that, that's the best as we can do. Yeah. And so if we cut that time by using a tool, we get the labor of, we get the, the time back that we used to spend on labor and thinking about it and, and those things to get an MVP in the market. And we can steer the car that isn't parked anymore in the marketplace, which is why do people think it's too expensive? Why aren't they buying? Why don't they, why are they ghosting me and not understand it?, the important stuff that gets you feedback from the thing that matters, which is the marketplace. Yeah. So I see the AI tools as just as an extension of our main job in business coaching, if you, which is time compression. Yeah. What tasks can be compressed now that allow us to spend more time where it matters, spend more time in the marketplace, spend more time creating, spend more time with clients, spend more time, or whatever it is, because we can use a tool to compress the time, then we can have more time doing things that are important. Yeah. But it doesn't save us from the, the, it doesn't, it won't save us from the work in totality. We've got to, we've got to have the right inputs to get the right outputs. Yep. I agree. I think AI is not coming for all coaches. It's coming for bad coaches and AI assisted coaches are gonna crush. I believe I really gonna crush, or at least disrupt the market significantly for people who are still trying to do it all themselves. it's 2017. And it was funny when you talked about how automations, with a big rage. I remember when I stepped into Taki's world and people learned that they could do stuff with VAs and they're, yeah, I've figured out how to get my VA to create all my content. And then you look at their posts and you're, I can tell it's terrible. Don't do it. Right?, and AI feels similar. It's, I, I use AI for this and this and this, and I think for me, how I'm just very pragmatically using it for anyone who wants to get better with these tools is number one, I talk through challenges and opportunities with chat GBT all the time. And I, when I say talk through, I almost never type anything into a chat GBT prompt box ever. I click the little microphone thing and I rant at it. Sometimes it's two minutes. I have my record, I think is 18 minutes of just, just jamming on everything. And I got this from Ty Lopez. He, Ty Lopez said he walked chat GBT through everything to do with all of his businesses and all of his net worth, and said, give me a hundred different counterintuitive approaches to how I can reduce my taxes and, decrease my liabilities, increase my net worth. And he said it was life-changing for him. So I was, great, I'm never talking. I'm never typing ever again. I'm just talking. The second thing is, is that I'm really identifying the places we are. Delivery feels heavy for me, or marketing feels heavy for me. And I'm trying to figure out how can chat GPT help me with this? So to your point, James, you talked about how people struggle with offers. So I had the smart idea of in January, I, I, I glad I framed it as an experiment, but I said, Hey everyone, for January, I'm reviewing your VSLs and your offers. And again, this is the self abandonment theme coming through. Again, I'm just here to help everybody

. And I'm trying to figure out how can chat GPT help me with this? So to your point, James, you talked about how people struggle with offers. So I had the smart idea of in January, I, I, I glad I framed it as an experiment, but I said, Hey everyone, for January, I'm reviewing your VSLs and your offers. And again, this is the self abandonment theme coming through. Again, I'm just here to help everybody. And, man, I'm glad it was 30 days. 'cause I just repeated myself for 30 days because everyone's offers are more or less broken, unclear, muddy in the same places. Same with the VSLs. So I've spent the last two weeks building out a GPT called the messaging architect that can now review offers better than I can. And I know this because it rewrote my offer for me this morning, not from scratch., Hey, chat GPTI uploaded 270 pages of all of my emails from the last two years, and then I gave it my offer. And I said, right, let's imagine you are my ideal client. Let's work through this line by line. I want you to challenge me. Where is it vague? Where is it unclear? Where does it not, where do you not think it will resonate with my audience? So I've been doing that. The second thing is I'm building out a GPT to help clients build out curriculum. So this will both be pragmatic things, they do a call with a one-to-one client or a group call. This will then you add the transcription. This will then create a cheat sheet for that training. Or on the flip side, you have the idea you want to build out a module and then you can build out a ready to go document that will then, do that. The second thing is I've created something that knows my voice really, really, really well. And I'm helping it, have it helping, having it help me rewrite ideas and thinking I gave it a thousand pages of my content. So it's taken me about two weeks to put this together. And the stuff that it's coming up with is amazing because it's pulling from my brain, but stuff that I've forgotten, I've taught for dozens of hours on content. So when someone asks me a question today, I'm pulling from my most recent thoughts, but there's probably a whole lot of past thoughts that I'm neglecting. So I've uploaded transcriptions, I've uploaded two years worth of Facebook posts and emails. And so now it's my second brain., so I think for everyone on this call, the simplest next step is identify areas where delivery, marketing or sales, really anything in your business feels heavy. And then take those areas to chat GBT and rant at it and ask it for help. And if you simply do that, it will be smart enough to at least give you some place to start. The thing I personally wouldn't do is allow yourself to get lost in the weeds of AI and be researching AI tools that really have no effect on your business. Unless of course it's enjoyable. Do not mistake productive procrastination for momentum., don't go deep on AI tools and then wonder why you're not making any money. It's because you're not making offers. You're not creating content. You're simply sitting there trying to figure out a better AI clipping tool than the last one you had that was already good enough. So those are the big things that are on my mind with chat with AI and chatt PT Yeah. If you look at it as really task-based, what problem am I trying to solve and how do I compress that time, then it's super useful., for example, meta ads burn through creative, I've never seen in my whole life nowadays because the a the audience size is so big

. So those are the big things that are on my mind with chat with AI and chatt PT Yeah. If you look at it as really task-based, what problem am I trying to solve and how do I compress that time, then it's super useful., for example, meta ads burn through creative, I've never seen in my whole life nowadays because the a the audience size is so big. So I, I'm selling, a two hour workshop in my front, one in my front end products, right? So I dumped the whole thing into Opus Clip, which is a clipping software, and it gave me 50 shorts back, right? Yeah. And then I do no discernment. I just pick the top 10 and I put them into an ad. Yeah. And, and then I let the AI meta AI sort through it because it just dumps creative in there. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna take all 40 videos now and put them in the ads because it's just gonna run through the, the content. Yeah. So that's the, rather than coming up with 40 unique, pieces of content for an ad Yeah. The AI takes that, breaks it down and, and feeds it and I feed it, and then that cuts the, the launch time by days. Yeah. The other, the other thing that I've been thinking about in terms of, Wait, can we just speak to this for one, one quick moment? Mm-hmm. Because I messaged you about one of these ads the other day, and this ad showed up on my feed and it was one of the worst ads I'd seen because it's a video and the first five seconds of the ad James is just silent. He's just sitting there, it's on a call. And then he comes in with a thought. And I messaged him. I said, this is so I Bet it's working. Yeah. I said, this is so weird. I wouldn't be surprised if it's working. And he was, yeah, it's, that's, and, I just wanna, That's the stupid thing. I know. I just wanna speak to this. Really, It works so well Because this could be one of the best things that people get from this call. Last month I spent, I dunno if Logan's on the call and he can drop it in the chat, he runs my ads. I don't know how much I spent, it was not much, it was less than a hundred dollars a day in ads. And I got 14 clients in at, in my $350 a week offer. So I think my ROI was 30 or 40 x, which is really crazy. And this is my, this is, if anyone who's running ads, I want you to write this down. The best ads don't feel ads. And the best VSLs don't feel VSLs. So I had, I've got someone in my pipeline right now that looks he's gonna come on it as a $12,000 a month client. He's at 600,000 a month. He has 2 million followers on Instagram, a million on on TikTok. He watched my VSL and he was, number one, I loved that you had no script. It just felt so real, which is a hundred percent true. I just ranted for 18 minutes. The second thing was, is that he said it really spoke to him because it felt I was just sharing the experience that I'd been through. And so I think it's so important to think counterintuitively to how you think the, the thing should look right. We think an ad we psychologically go into, I'm writing an ad, I'm trying to be incredibly persuasive
