# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 2

## The Insight Funnel & High-Tier Offers show how. Show the working show how you transform something, how you change something. Show the steps that that person took to do it and show as much behind the scenes as you possibly can. These are not testimonials. They're case studies. Testimonials are, hey? It was great to work with him, and it was great to work with her, and it was wonderful. And it's changed my life. These are these the steps this person took? Then we're giving them the offer. The the rule of thumb in an insight funnel is we start high. So we start with our highest tier offer because the economics in a lead based funnel mean that we have to convert at the highest possible economics. So I lead these days with a conversation about one to one, or working for the sovereign circle, because it is an easier conversation to that. And then, if that's not a fit, 5 where they are with me, with finances or their current position in the market. Then I'dinvite them to the syndicate. So that path, if we look at a funnel is Big Idea Video, we're taking them through there. We're giving them the offer. We're offering them our highest tier plan, and then we're downselling them into the into the middle tier. So the insight funnel is, very much straightforward. You put traffic through it again. It can be used equally effectively in in an organic environment as it can to to running ads to it. If you're running ads, I'll add some components later on, which show how you can choose between offering., a gated insight video. So a video where people have to, you know, put an email address in or not. Some of those, some benefit from having a gate, and some don't. I prefer these days to run, big ideas or Vsls very much ungated, so people can consume the info and get insight as quickly as possible. show how.

## The Customer Funnel (Low-Ticket) The the second piece is, the customer funnel, and, for all intents and purposes it's just a low ticket funnel. It's just a low ticket funnel, but. a lot of them, the devil is in the detail. So . Step one is obviously you need to run traffic to it. Low ticket funnels, unless you have gigantic, enormous audiences need large amounts of traffic to them, because the the net levels of conversion on the front end to make the economics work just need a lot of eyeballs. And so the the ads these days, there's lots of different forms. I still. I still maintain a few people disagree. I still maintain a long form and a story based ad will work pretty well. Some of the economic, some of the cost per leads, etc, in my, in my Facebook account right now, justify that where a long form story, based Ad. Especially on in Facebook land, still works pretty well to get capture attention and convert it. In the other forms that we have now of consumption. stories and and vertical video. And these things, then does what it says on the tin ads, get this for $9. Get this for $5. This is what's inside it. Work extremely well, because they're very snackable and clickable. So people know what they're clicking on because it says it on there. how to get high ticket clients without sales calls $9. It's very much it does what it says on the tin.

## Ad Creatives & Audiences The other thing that I've tested with some results, even though it's It's a little bit all over the place, in terms of which ones work. And what creative work is, I've taken, opus clip, or one of those, clip chopping services, and use the shorts from the product. So the hybrid offer, for example, has . a 2 h long workshop with it. I chuck it in into the into the tool. I get the shorts back, and I use some of the shorts as ads. Most of them are wildly out of context because they're from the middle of a training. But some of them also get traction and work to convert, and purchases audiences go big, run, run a big, open audience for the countries that you that you want to target run interests and run warm as well for landing page viewers, for viewers and followers, etc. having those 3 there, you will dial in with the different content types and and find it increasingly. It's a creative game rather than audience game. Once you find the audiences that work, you feed them, very good amounts of creative, probably these days assisted with AI creative in terms of, that does what it says on the tin imagery. And the low ticket offers. So the concept of the Dcm. too, came from me going? Well, I've got a product. I've got a video that says, the same stuff. It's the same ideas. It's the same, it's the same original Google Doc, that started the book that then I can then talk to.

## Repurposing Content for Different Buying Types Why don't I just present them in 2 different ways to for 2 different buying types. So it's fair to say that the big idea video is just the book in video form in terms of consumption. And that's why the the core of the funnel. The same idea can be present in both places. People are just going to consume it in different ways. One way is, the free path. They're going to watch a video. And another way is them investing and buying. the media that goes with it. So within that we've also got sub products. the the hybrid offer for me and and the trainings that the training that goes in there in the template has worked particularly well in the top of funnel. The components that need to be there are pretty straightforward again the headline drives, most of the activity. And then, as we've gone along, we've called out different people, coaches, consultants, agency owners who sell high ticket services. Give it some credibility exactly what's in it. Give it a guarantee, give it an FAQ. Put some testimonials on the page, but that's only after we've proven the market wants it. and, as I always say, use an asset. You've already got to deploy into a low ticket funnel. The one of the major mistakes are giving too much in the front end. what's the rule of one. It's clear they get one valuable thing from the purchase for me. It's clear that they get a template that they can use immediately, even if they're not using it. They have a tool in their toolkit that they that they get access to immediately that they can see how someone else is doing it.

## ## Low-Ticket Offer Strategy Templates Pdfs Books

## Low-Ticket Offer Strategy Templates Pdfs books. They work, in the one to $10 range bundles of trainings or bundles of templates, or, or, bundling multiple things together. 15 to $30. Live workshops perform particularly well. especially if you've got somewhat of a warm audience, 25 to 100 based on your marketplace. And you're aiming for, an 8% front end. Conversion off that page. That's a that's a rule of thumb. Again, it depends on the economics, because the goal of an info funnel is always to get the advertising dollars back as much as you can. The the nice thing about this funnel and as a lot of people have found is that you can have multiple front end offers and then run everything else the same. So I have the same bump across all my front end, low ticket products the Cash campaign. It's complementary to the 1st purchase they make. So it converts very well that converts at over 70% at the moment. So you're aiming for a 50% conversion of the bump. My bump is $29, so it needs to convert at least over 50%. Some people have got good success with a., a $39 bump, and of course you need slightly. You don't need quite as much conversion to make that work. I'vealways found that bumps order bumps work best in the 24 to $29 range. Again, relative to the market.

## Implementation Steps

## Upsells and Membership Offers The upsell. Take something you've already got and sell it to them. The upsell purely exists to raise the average order value right? So I sell the 3 K code and the social code for $99. That's a big old bundle of training. There's something close to 6 h of stuff in there. To consume. So it's a big old chunk. I think there's a there's a reasonable hypothesis that slows down the purchase of people consume it. And so if you notice that you're you're getting a lot of upsell sales, but you're not getting a lot lot of back in sales, then your upsell might be, in the this is too good category. I've found that $99 works again. I've I've used upsells that, work at 1 99 as well, just just equally there. It purely exists to, increase average order value. Don't include too much stuff, don't include a 52 video course in there, as it will slow down the whole purchasing cycle. And you want 20% of people to convert it to convert into it. We can go here straight to a membership offer. We've got a customer there in motion. They're buying information. Let's make a hypothesis that they want more information. So I go straight to a membership coming in at 8, $50 a week, and then they they can come in at $50 a week. Try it out, cancel any time if they it. They stay. We're aiming for a 20% retention rate off the membership. We don't expect., many people to stay whatsoever, but it gets us customers, and ultimately we can upgrade those customers in the future., and once someone's in motion, and once someone's buying, we want to know what they're going to buy next. So, the obvious upsell for me past the membership is buying the syndicate, getting access to me. Excuse me. One thing that they tested early on that that has worked extremely well is that when I'm delivering the product that they've bought, when they've bought the hybrid offer workshop. They've gone through the funnel. If they haven't bought the membership. Then by the time they get to the training I'm offering them a trial. So I'm offering, and quite a few people here joined via that trial. So I've just got a passive call to action around the. And I've given you this template as well around the training that allows people to, join the trial. If they are consuming the training, they the training. Then saying. Hey, get more of this. That's a very. Congruent place to put it where they can trial the membership as they're consuming the product. The upsell. Take something you've already got and sell it to them.

## Benefits of the Dual-Mode Funnel So the the 2.0 funnel, is a is a dual mode we are generating leads. And we're also generating customers that as we go along, they, we, we need to optimize them based on the market. How many people are coming through as leads? How many conversations are you generating? How many customers are we generating, and at what value, and what are they buying right? So the immediate result is the and the 2.0 funnel is you get leads, customers and clients every day. Right? You're also getting future buyers and new customers and new clients at a high velocity much higher than nurture based funnels. So cash flow grows as the funnel dials in allowing you to scale marketing, spend faster than a traditional funnel in a traditional funnel. You've got to put leads in the top, have conversations. Wait till you get the client out the other side to understand what's the cost per acquisition, etc, etc. with a cash flow based funnel with a customer funnel complementing that we can generate cash every day and generate sales every day that feeds the whole system. So I found with these type of funnels running them in conjunction, you can scale them quicker because you are getting cash on the daily basis rather than having to wait 7 or 14 or 30 days to get a client out the other side and the other major byproduct is my list that the growth of my email list is predominantly made up of buyers these days. Right? So as my email list grows, I have more and more buyers. If I have more and more buyers on my email list, I get a higher response when I make an offer, because I've already got people on the list who are buyers. So the slow, steady, but, appreciable, compounding effect which most good things come from that compounds. Today. When I make an offer, I get a much higher response rate than it was than if it was made up from purely leads. I would much rather have a smaller list made up of buyers and customers than a large list made up of people who have just opted into something, and I've got the permission to communicate with. So the the 2.0 funnel, is a is a dual mode we are generating leads. And we're also generating customers that as we go along, they, we, we need to optimize them based on the market. How many people are coming through as leads? How many conversations are you generating? How many customers are we generating, and at what value, and what are they buying right?
