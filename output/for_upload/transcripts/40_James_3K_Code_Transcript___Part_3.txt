# James 3K Code Transcript - Part 3

. James Kemp: So get people to a no James Kemp: right? Is it a timing thing? Is the price thing? Is it a is it a promise thing? Is it a clear? Is it a clear piece. James Kemp: a clarity thing? What makes fun? What questions do they ask James Kemp: again? Clear is kind, clear, is kind to yourself and Clear is kind in office. James Kemp: What questions do they ask? If your offer is unclear, they will ask questions about it. What questions? Don't they ask? James Kemp: What's missing from it? Do they understand? James Kemp: And are they feeling the pain? And are they acutely aware of the problem as you made the assumption that they have. James Kemp: So at the stage of off-value, validation, activity, and action James Kemp: always trump perfection and procrastination. And a few people again, recently have kindly shared. They're working through of that perfection and procrastination, constantly tweaking the offer, Doc, and not sending it to people James Kemp: constantly procrastinating, saying, I don't have enough leads, or it's the wrong time of year. There's always a reason not to do it. So put an action plan in place. James Kemp: follow up with 5 people every day. Cold, outreach 10 people every day, this is easier for some people than others. James Kemp: Put 3 pieces of content out into the into the world every week to start conversations. Who interacts with those who can you speak to. James Kemp: the Internet has removed all excuses of our ability to connect with other people. It has never been easier to connect with other people. We just need to connect and have a conversation in a contextual way. James Kemp: So create a plan? Who you gonna out, reach out to in the next 14 days? What assets can you utilize to validate sooner rather than later? What daily tasks are non negotiable to have those conversations. James Kemp: So James Kemp: Conrad message me yesterday, and said. Hey, I've I've got about 20 people that that stopped that stopped at different times of the year that I'm not currently working with. James Kemp: shall I? We've we've come up with a mastermind offer. Shall I make that offer to them. And I'm, Yeah, it's a good time to do it. Right. Message 20 people, 3 people in the course of a day converted into a mastermind for multiple thousands of dollars, people that just popped into his head James Kemp: that he'd stopped working with at a particular time, that he messaged and outreached James Kemp: because he has an offer that he knows that if he puts it in front of people James Kemp: it will get them to take action or get them. A no, and a lot of those people will say, no, not right now. Maybe next year I'm doing this in January. Maybe I'll readdress this in march, they'll give them the future. James Kemp: So James Kemp: it isn't. It is critically important not only to intellectualize and get the insights and creating office fun and the feelings of clarity that you get going through this process James Kemp: our people can attest to how enjoyable that is when you start to get clear about your offer. James Kemp: but it only turns into something when the rubber hits the road and get it out to other people. James Kemp: So make a plan and do it. James Kemp: Who has questions. I'm going to drop the doc James Kemp: and the template. julie williams: I have a question, James. James Kemp: fire away, Julie. julie williams: Okay, I'm gonna get to the guts of what I feel my hesitation is. And taking this forward

. James Kemp: So make a plan and do it. James Kemp: Who has questions. I'm going to drop the doc James Kemp: and the template. julie williams: I have a question, James. James Kemp: fire away, Julie. julie williams: Okay, I'm gonna get to the guts of what I feel my hesitation is. And taking this forward. I sold my program about 18 months ago, and I'm still running my Physio Pr practice part time. julie williams: And I used to go straight to mentoring. I wanted to show them exactly in a zoom call. We did a zoom call with this practice in Mt. Waverly. julie williams: and first of all it was there was. I wanted them to get a an actual client, one of their own clients. It was suffering with whatever usually back pain. julie williams: and they couldn't do that. They didn't want to do that, and that that's understandable, I suppose, because it's a privacy issue, and all of that. So we use a therapist which was an ideal. julie williams: Do I need this context, Julie? Or do you have a question? Yeah. So it was the delivery that I had a problem with, and I committed to that for julie williams: 6 weeks every an hour, every 6 weeks. and I ended up hiding it. I absolutely hated it. julie williams: and it put me off of even taking it out. julie williams: So I'm, listening to what you're saying here about and follow up your 5 emails, your cold rich, your 3 pieces of content. And I'm getting nervous about this because I'm I'm worried that it's going to be too much coming at me julie williams: all at once. And how do I handle that back? End? That delivery that promise, and not muck it up? julie williams: It's scary for me. julie williams: So is that a question or or yeah, it's a question, how? How? How do we? James Kemp: How do you not have fear? julie williams: How do I? How do I control what might come at me with opening up this James Kemp: by being very, very clear about the boundaries that you're delivering on James Kemp: right? This is the promise. This is the plan. This is how we're going to get there. James Kemp: This is the access to the training you get. This is the community community that we get. And this is when we're on calls together. James Kemp: So clear is kind. julie williams: yeah, okay, I think I probably need some help with setting the boundaries and all of that stuff. James Kemp: You just need to set them and stick to them. No one can help you with setting your own boundaries. julie williams: Yeah. James Kemp: that this. The act of setting the boundaries is. James Kemp:, the act of creating the offer julie williams: and what you're prepared to do James Kemp: and what they need. James Kemp: and lots of those things intercept. Don't intersect in the marketplace, and that's fine. James Kemp: But it's only what you're prepared to do. julie williams: Hmm. julie williams: okay. thanks, Jess. James Kemp: I, and I'll and I'll say it again. James Kemp: I'm being really prescriptive today. James Kemp: And black syndicate folks will get into mindset, and those things all we and other and other contexts, but. James Kemp: the act of doing this. James Kemp: the active to the construction of it

. julie williams: Hmm. julie williams: okay. thanks, Jess. James Kemp: I, and I'll and I'll say it again. James Kemp: I'm being really prescriptive today. James Kemp: And black syndicate folks will get into mindset, and those things all we and other and other contexts, but. James Kemp: the act of doing this. James Kemp: the active to the construction of it. as James Kemp: getting it out, getting it out of the way and getting it out there. That's all that matters. You can feel lots of ways about things. James Kemp: but if you're committed to the outcome that you want for yourself, and you're the outcome that you want for the client. Then only do the things that you want to do. James Kemp: Emily. Emily Utter: Hi, I have lots of questions as usual, I did my first workshop today. I think I had 14 sales. which I guess is all right, considering I have no social media. And I made the offer for the first time, and it was a hot mess. But anyways. Emily Utter: as you're going through this, what I'm realizing, I think my offer. Promise still isn't clear. I'm in the make more money category. That's what I'm helping them do. But I feel my Emily Utter: angle of it. And this might be the problem I'm not sure is the self expression. love your business Emily Utter: what we did in the workshop today was, explore the different friction points all the things they don't really in the business. Right? Emily Utter: So Emily Utter: I wrote, I wrote a bunch of notes while you're talking. Can my core offer be? I help you make more money through self-expression? Or is that too nebulous? And people are fuck that, or I don't care, or whatever James Kemp: it is, pretty nebulous, how much money? What does the expression look ? Emily Utter: Well, so okay, for example, I helped a client shift her niche, and then the very first launch of her program. She did a half a million launch, and it's because I helped her do the thing she really wanted to do, instead of the thing she was pretending she wanted to do. James Kemp: So. The first step that we go through in the plan is aligning you with your James Kemp: ideal niche that you can freely express yourself to with my Ach system. Emily Utter: Okay. Emily Utter: no such system exists. It's Emily's bullshit meter. Put a Tm on everything, and it's a system, right Emily Utter: whatever. I think when you mentioned the bleeding confusion I was, yeah. And I think, too, most of the people who bought my workshop. And I'm sure, the first sales into this community. They're all gonna be people who've worked with me. Emily Utter: And so I've been banking on the fact that, they know, my time is worth it. And so I could call it Emily Utter: talk to Emily, and I feel those people would still buy. Maybe that's naive. Maybe I'm being lazy. And I do have my whole. Pdf, I don't know if you're open to looking at it, or I can post it, or whatever. But James Kemp: The core is, the core is making more money. Emily Utter: But the method is through James Kemp: self expression. Emily Utter: right? Right? But people aren't waking up in the night crying over their self expression. are they? Yeah? Cause. They're ashamed of making money. James Kemp: just people are ashamed of wanting good relationships or having more sex or getting better bodies when it comes down to it

. But James Kemp: The core is, the core is making more money. Emily Utter: But the method is through James Kemp: self expression. Emily Utter: right? Right? But people aren't waking up in the night crying over their self expression. are they? Yeah? Cause. They're ashamed of making money. James Kemp: just people are ashamed of wanting good relationships or having more sex or getting better bodies when it comes down to it. Everybody's just ashamed of the thing that. James Kemp: and you give them the permission to go out there and say, no, I want to make. Emily Utter: Yeah. James Kemp: I'm unapologetic that making money is, super important. Emily Utter: Right? Emily Utter: Yeah. I guess what I Emily Utter: I feel with us talking about it right now. It makes sense. But from a marketing perspective. That's where I'm a little bit . Because I can, I can make it make sense through storytelling. But that's a lot of words. James Kemp: Hmm. Emily Utter: right?, I have so many amazing examples Emily Utter: of where I help clients do this double their revenue. But Emily Utter: or or maybe maybe that is the promise. I'm, afraid to promise that, double your revenue by being more self expressed. James Kemp: And you, you need to demonstrate that over and over again. Emily Utter: But is that believable? Emily Utter: Yeah, wait. Who's giving me the thumbs up? Geo. I don't know if I'm saying your name right. Thank you. Emily Utter: not if you don't believe it, social proof at its finest Emily Utter: thanks for all the comments guys that helps. Yeah., I have a lot of questions. Maybe I can post my, my team hated the Google Docs. So we do have it in a Pdf, and it's branded. So could I post that in the syndicate. Whoever's available to give me feedback on it? Because, I'd love for you guys to tell me, why wouldn't you buy, Emily Utter: what's compelling in it? What's stupid? There's all these testimonials on it. I don't know if we need that. Maybe we just do a few case studies of Emily Utter: the few. few banger examples I'd, I'm saying, you need a promise. James Kemp: Yeah. Emily Utter: Okay, so then, but also my plan feels it's all over the friggin place. James Kemp: although maybe it's not okay. It's what they're selling. It's their content. And then I don't know what the third thing is, does it have to be 3 things. It's who they're selling to. Emily Utter: Yeah. And also, I'm just really good at helping people with sales in general. James Kemp: Yeah. But it's who they're selling to. Emily Utter: I don't know why I'm tripping out over this. Emily Utter: I'm in my own confusion, but the believability that's that comes out from the market comes from you James Kemp: when people say, Is it believable? What they're saying is, Am I allowed to do this? Emily Utter: Well, this is exactly the thing, because I'm being Emily Utter: the thing that I need coaching on from me., I'm exactly in that right now, I need me to be dude fucking. Do it James Kemp: fucking, do it, do fucking, do it? Emily Utter: Yeah, I'm sweating. Oh, my God, okay. James Kemp: this is this is, and I and I went through the cool pieces quickly, because this is where the shame comes up

., I'm exactly in that right now, I need me to be dude fucking. Do it James Kemp: fucking, do it, do fucking, do it? Emily Utter: Yeah, I'm sweating. Oh, my God, okay. James Kemp: this is this is, and I and I went through the cool pieces quickly, because this is where the shame comes up. James Kemp: This is where people don't fully go there with the core of . James Kemp: I help people make money. James Kemp: I help people naked. James Kemp: I help people. Whatever Emily Utter: the the the underlying thing that stops people isn't James Kemp: the the practical reality of a. It's the shame that's underneath it that they're somehow making money as bad, or having more sex as bad, or looking better, naked as bad, or whatever you fucking help people with James Kemp:, the yeah, most things lead back to there, anyway. Right? Emily Utter: I think my thing is more, does anyone care or ? Emily Utter: Why would they care if you care? James Kemp: Well, yeah, okay, I care a lot about helping is me caring enough James Kemp: that they can be free on their dimension of freedom. Right? You care a lot about helping people make money James Kemp: with people they care about. Emily Utter: Right? James Kemp: So it gives them some relief that the the skills they've accumulated were worth it. Emily Utter: What I really care about is people making money and being themselves, because everybody, self sensors and everybody waters themselves down and when somebody is really authentic, and then they can blast their business crazy being that. That's when I'm, fuck. Yeah, that's what I'm . If you just take that as you coaching yourself. Emily Utter: None of us needed to be here. Thanks, guys. James Kemp: but but this is this is the this is the people talk about alignment. But that's alignment. Emily Utter: Yeah. James Kemp: So you without you fully expressing yourself and being okay, that making money is good. James Kemp: you can't unlock it in them. Emily Utter: Yeah. and that the cool. And I've gone through the practical prescription reason of the core. James Kemp: But the thing that stops people with the core is going. Yeah, I just help people make money. James Kemp: Why does some people have a better life through this vehicle? Emily Utter: Yeah. Emily Utter: hate to exist? Emily Utter: I wrote, can I really in all caps, make money. Being myself, I feel that's what I need to hit. It's just, Yes, you can. You don't have to be this other version of yourself. Emily Utter: You're gonna make more being who you really are. James Kemp: Always Emily Utter: yeah. Emily Utter: cool. Thank you. And thanks everyone for all the feedback appreciate it. James Kemp: Yeah, guys, the thing that stops people choosing the core is they want. They everyone assembles lots of things around it James Kemp: to obfuscate from the actual call. because they hedge it. James Kemp: I hope you make money, but I do it in a really nice way. Help you get more dates, but I do it ethically. I hope you lose weight, but not to look better, because that vanity, always got a fucking asterisk next to it, and a hedge. James Kemp: but if you choose the core. and you just believe it and commit to it. James Kemp: then everything else. Just there's a bit as a benefit around that. and that's what makes it work

. Help you get more dates, but I do it ethically. I hope you lose weight, but not to look better, because that vanity, always got a fucking asterisk next to it, and a hedge. James Kemp: but if you choose the core. and you just believe it and commit to it. James Kemp: then everything else. Just there's a bit as a benefit around that. and that's what makes it work. Gieo: My my question is, is really dovetail, or or, is directly onto it. Emily, was this coming to there? And so if it's okay, if I can jump on in here. Gieo: on the concept of the core, define the core. Gieo: And and I'm sure this is a this is a could be probably an ongoing debate. But what I, when I heard Emily say, and this is also relates a little bit to my own ponderings about about this question as well, which is, what is the core, and and to me what I kinda heard Emily say was that, she helps people make money Gieo: and and and that that probably is a very. Obviously, what I thought to myself, everybody wants to make money. So that's a pretty core thing. But in in terms of what? What does that really mean to be, to have a core offer. It does strike me that. That the addition of Gieo: of her unique thing, the the, a as a as a unique expression of yourself, or however however you say it, Emily, but but that and that's my own, questioning. That's why I wanted to dovetail on to it, too, because Gieo: I heard this., this piece was the the piece that I heard the most in in in in in your presentation today about the core offer. And so so I'm poundering the same same type of thing. And I'm starting to explore. Gieo: th, the this concept that in my world. Yes, same thing. I help people make money. I I am a business consultant and and working that way for the health and wellness field. Gieo: And so I'm exploring now that the health and wellness as a lifestyle Gieo: is pretty pretty close to my core offer. because that's the niche I'm speaking to. and it's both my clients, but also my clients. Clients? James Kemp: Hmm! What's the question? Gieo: The question is. does does that jive with your prescription of what the core offer would be. Gieo: or or or are you more of a purist and, what do they really want? James Kemp: What do they really want? Gieo: ? I said, everybody wants to make more money., that's . That's a that's that's the thing gives you freedom. You. You have your way of saying it, too, which is true. True freedom is downstream from financial freedom. Is that pretty close to that's pretty close to your your why and your offer? Do you use that to inspire your your core offer from Gieo: that statement? James Kemp: Yeah, if we if we look if we look at the. James Kemp: If we look at the intro James Kemp: pumping out cash. James Kemp: our goal is building a million dollar sovereign consulting business with 50 clients or less for 3 days per week on the tools. Right? James Kemp: The currency is money. the way I do it is unique to me. James Kemp: Emily's currency is money, the way she does it is unique to her. James Kemp: Your currency is money. the way you do it is unique to you. James Kemp: So you're encapsulating. But the core people. There
