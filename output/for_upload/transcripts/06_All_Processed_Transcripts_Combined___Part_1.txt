- ```txt ## Building a 1000 True Fan Audience **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of building a loyal audience of "true fans" who consistently engage and purchase, emphasizing intentionality and quality over quantity. He outlines three core strategies for audience growth: borrowing, building, and buying. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Morning peeps! How are you all doing? Awesome. I will share the doc as usual. Unfortunately, I have to take off copying permissions on my trainings. The rampant thievery has got to the point of ridiculousness. The docs and recordings are there to use, and also posted inside skool. So, 1,000 true fans – the template for finding a thousand true fans who buy from you daily. This isn't just about growing an audience, though I'll use that word a lot. It's about nurturing an audience that does things. A lot of audiences don't do much. They'll follow, watch, applaud, but they won't interact or buy. Building an audience these days needs to be intentional. If you're intentional, you don't need a huge audience. Just with offers, if we're intentional and understand the dynamics, we don't need that many clients. This is about doing it the smart and efficient way. Today, I'll talk about the three ways to grow. I'll touch on capturing and communicating, but next week I'll dive deep into owning and communicating with an audience to get them to do things. I'm over-delivering on the templates – we've got well over 100 that are easily replicable. Use the themes, principles, and insights. Last week of August, I'll do an open Q&A. ## The Importance of Creation in Audience Building **Summary:** James Kemp stresses that creation is fundamental to audience growth. Strategy provides guardrails, but creation itself fuels connection and allows for the transition to a creator economy where creativity is rewarded. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I want to set the scene: you *must* create to communicate. Without creation, none of this works. I'll give you templates and ways to do things, things you can replicate, but you must create on top of those. *How* you create, *what* you create, *who* you create for, and *where* – those are the strategy. Strategy requires thought, but not too much. Many get trapped in "what's the best platform?" Those are just decisions. Execute on them. Creation is the energy. Strategy sets you free to create. The online world has accelerated the transition from the knowledge economy to the creator economy. You're rewarded for your creativity. People look for that freshness and energy. Creating true fans, not just an audience, is through communication that connects. The Internet allows us to connect in new ways. Connection shows you understand them. Demonstrate usefulness and a vision that only a leader can have. Building an audience is your biggest asset. A friend retired three years ago, hasn't created anything new, and makes over a million dollars a year selling other people's stuff. He has an audience, a list, connection, and trust. If people know, and trust you, you'll never lack opportunity. Your audience evolves with you. I've gone from traditional consulting to e-commerce to lead generation. Some have been with me through it all. Built properly, it's an asset that lasts. There are three basic phases. Today, we'll dig into the three ways to build, then discuss capturing, communicating, and repurposing. ## Three Core Strategies for Audience Growth **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the three core strategies for audience growth: borrowing (leveraging other people's audiences), building (creating content on social media), and buying (using paid advertising). He emphasizes that relationships are key and take time, and each strategy has its own skill requirements and trade-offs

. There are three basic phases. Today, we'll dig into the three ways to build, then discuss capturing, communicating, and repurposing. ## Three Core Strategies for Audience Growth **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the three core strategies for audience growth: borrowing (leveraging other people's audiences), building (creating content on social media), and buying (using paid advertising). He emphasizes that relationships are key and take time, and each strategy has its own skill requirements and trade-offs. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** There are only three ways to build an audience. There's no fast *and* good way. The key factor is relationship, and relationships take time. The more deliberate you are, the faster it happens. Each domain has skill requirements and trade-offs. All are useful, the mixture is up to you. Some exclusively use ads, some borrow audiences, some are purely organic. The balance depends on trade-offs and skills. All require investment – time, skills, or money. Reps are required. I'll give you a basic plan with reps for short, medium, and long-term returns. Think long-term. The three strategies are: *Borrow*: Someone already has your future client. They trust that person. Transfer that trust to you. Borrow their attention. *Build*: Social media is publishing. Be discovered. Create content. *Buy*: Buy attention. Buy audience quickly. Build depth and relationship. Define next steps. ## The Importance of Skill and Usefulness in Audience Building **Summary:** James Kemp argues that a lack of opportunities to borrow an audience often reveals a lack of skill or usefulness. He emphasizes the importance of investing in your craft and demonstrating your value. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I'm going to be blunt: a deficiency of opportunity in any of these categories exposes a lack of skills or usefulness. Borrowing an audience is the way to build a high-quality audience. If you can't get in front of someone else's audience, you haven't invested enough in your craft or demonstrated your value. I could turn up anywhere weekly because I've invested and demonstrated, and people want to hear me. This builds a high-quality audience and doesn't require huge leads, as people are pre-qualified. True fans trust you. Trust has to be transferred. Choose partners that cross over but don't compete directly. Don't try to steal clients. Demonstrate value. Calls to action are overrated. Borrowing an audience fits into two categories: teaching and sharing. ## Borrowing an Audience: Teaching **Summary:** James Kemp explains that teaching is a powerful way to borrow an audience. By teaching something valuable and timely, you demonstrate your expertise and build trust with a new audience. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The first category is *teaching*. Teach something they haven't seen or that you're known for. My friend Taki runs a coaching program. We disagree on some things, but agree on many. I'm an easy person for him to invite to teach his people. I've taught his groups offer creation, book funnels, and what's working now. I was opening the kimono, giving his people exclusive insights. Demonstrations of what's working now are easy.

That's great, virtually or in person. A downloadable resource is a bonus, not required. If you teach well and demonstrate value, people will reach out. Teaching what's working now has the highest response rate. It's the fast lane from audience member to customer to client. Turning up might be scheduled or impromptu. Allow audience interaction and Q&A. You're not there to sell, you're there to teach and demonstrate. The better you do that, the more likely you are to sell. You can get clients weekly this way. I know someone who exclusively does this. It works because of trust transfer. You inherit trust from the person who puts you on their stage. ## Borrowing an Audience: Sharing **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the second way to borrow an audience: sharing what's working now. This often requires permission but can be highly effective in demonstrating your expertise and relevance. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The second way is *sharing*. Demonstrate what's working now. This often requires permission. I've done this in Taki's program and others. "Hey, this thing's working right now." It makes you relevant and timely. You often need permission, especially if it's not purely altruistic. Show them everything, demonstrate insight, show exactly what you're doing in real time. This is a high-rep, high-return strategy. Getting on other people's stages compounds quickly. Reach out weekly and offer to teach. Someone has your ideal client right now. This is how I'd build a small, engaged audience. The crossover will be contextually aware. You could reach a few hundred people a year and get a significant number crossing over, with trust transfer, willing to buy. It's the way to build quality. ## Building an Audience: Choosing the Right Platform **Summary:** James Kemp advises on choosing the right social media platform for building an audience, emphasizing the importance of discernment and understanding the realities of each platform's algorithm. He stresses consistency over platform choice. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The second way is *building* an audience. This is much slower and getting more difficult. We need a way to be discovered. I'll break this into two parts: platforms (guardrails) and what to say. Choosing a platform requires discernment. What's natural for you? What are the realities of each platform? Here's the reality of algorithms: to grow, you need to be discovered. You need to grow outside the same pool of people. Algorithms change. *Facebook* (personal profile) is friend-centric. It doesn't allow for much discovery. 90% of my profile views are friends. It has limits for growth, but allows for deeper connection. *Instagram* is highly discoverable and visual. 93% of my post views are non-followers. But it's visual, requiring higher production. *LinkedIn* is highly targeted, but low interaction. People aren't on there frequently. It has a low decay rate. *YouTube* is low discovery, long lifetime, but high production. Content lasts for years, versus hours or days on other platforms. ## Building an Audience: Content Strategy and Repurposing **Summary:** James Kemp dismisses the idea of a "best" platform, advocating for consistency and creating content for a primary platform then distributing it to others. He suggests a simple copy-paste strategy and shares his own approach. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The worst idea is that there's a "best" platform. There isn't. There's just a best platform *for you*. Trust and attention can be built anywhere. Social networks have real humans. Create for a primary platform, distribute to others. The best social media strategy is copy-paste. Publish on one, take it to another

. He suggests a simple copy-paste strategy and shares his own approach. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The worst idea is that there's a "best" platform. There isn't. There's just a best platform *for you*. Trust and attention can be built anywhere. Social networks have real humans. Create for a primary platform, distribute to others. The best social media strategy is copy-paste. Publish on one, take it to another. I screenshot Facebook posts, put them over random videos, and run them as Instagram Reels. They get 3,000 organic views, 90% new people. The best platform is one you can create consistently on. I don't even Facebook much, but it's where I can create consistently, distribute from, and repurpose easily. Consistency is the number one pillar. If you're a writer, Facebook and LinkedIn work well. If you're great on video, use a video-centric platform. I can't consistently produce video, so I don't try. I do what I can consistently do. If what you can create consistently, focus on that. They all work. Be consistent in creation and distribution. ## Building an Audience: Four Content Buckets **Summary:** James Kemp introduces four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problems, and plan – that drive audience engagement and build trust. He explains that the best content incorporates one or more of these elements. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** What do you say? 90% of results are driven by 10% of your content. I've posted thousands of times, and can highlight two dozen posts that moved the needle. There are four content buckets: *philosophy*, *proof*, *problems*, and *plan*. Philosophy is what you believe. It used to be nice-to-have, now it's essential. What we do is commoditized, but *we* aren't. People buy who you are and what you believe. What do you believe? How do you think differently? What's hiding in plain sight? Delivering insight signals you as useful. You provide an external perspective. I talk about congruence. Fat personal trainers don't get many clients. That's a philosophical take. I do what I teach, and teach what I do. ## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Philosophy and Proof **Summary:** James Kemp elaborates on the philosophy and proof content buckets. Philosophy involves sharing your beliefs and unique perspectives, while proof goes beyond testimonials to demonstrate how you help clients achieve results. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** People would be shocked how little profit some "7-figure heroes" make. I share my struggles. This demonstrates you're human. *Proof* is nuanced. It goes beyond testimonials. Prove you can help by demonstrating *how* you help. This delivers insight on how someone got a result. Don't just say "so-and-so got a result." Demonstrate the steps and insights. "These are the three ways someone got this result." This proves you can replicate it. These make excellent ads. *Problems* demonstrate competence. Share insights you gather. The more common the problem, the more unique your solution, the more traction you get. Give it all away. Don't hold back. Observe and offer solutions. This works on two fronts: people want you to solve their problem, and you build goodwill by helping. I have numerous examples of people reaching out after these posts saying they changed something and got a result. ## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Problems and Plan **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the problems and plan content buckets. Problems involve addressing common audience challenges and offering solutions, while plan demonstrates leadership by outlining a clear direction and vision. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I love seeing people do this. Delivering certainty in uncertain times is crucial

. I have numerous examples of people reaching out after these posts saying they changed something and got a result. ## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Problems and Plan **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the problems and plan content buckets. Problems involve addressing common audience challenges and offering solutions, while plan demonstrates leadership by outlining a clear direction and vision. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I love seeing people do this. Delivering certainty in uncertain times is crucial. The *plan* is the big daddy of content. It demonstrates leadership. To establish leadership, decide on a direction, define it, and lead others. The plan brings together all other content types. It's a demonstration of certainty. Plans require courage. They work as pillar content. I talked about my path back to $3 million a year. 10 months later, I hit it. It's a demonstration of competence and certainty. Having a plan is essential. "I'm going to do this with this many people." These are effective ways to grow an audience and be relevant. They require courage because you're exposing yourself. My client set a high profit goal. He's not hitting it, so he's writing about why and what he's doing differently. These have a soap opera element. People follow along. Taki had a plan to help 50 coaches to a million a year. It was a narrative he wove through his content. Plans can also take the form of sharing results. "7 things I learned to create a $73k MRR business." Share the insights. ## Building an Audience: Calls to Action and Content Reps **Summary:** James Kemp challenges the conventional wisdom of always including a call to action, suggesting that high-quality content often speaks for itself. He recommends starting with three content pieces per week and increasing frequency as you become more prolific. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Do you have to have a call to action? I have higher performance on posts *without* a CTA. Social media that constantly tells people to do stuff ceases to be social. If the content is good, you'll get a response. You don't need a CTA on every post. If something is time-based, a deadline, or limited spots, it's natural to point it out. What reps are required? Consistency. I write daily, so people think I'll make them do the same. If you can't do it consistently, don't do it. Start with three times a week and increase frequency when you become more prolific. Content reps build content reps. The way to write more is to write more. Establishing the skill makes it easier to deploy. There shouldn't be force in content creation. If you feel forced, narrow it down to be creative and consistent. Your results will vary. Establish a benchmark. ## Buying an Audience: The Daily Client Machine **Summary:** James Kemp discusses buying an audience through paid traffic, highlighting the potential pitfalls of generating low-intent leads. He introduces the Daily Client Machine as a solution for building an audience and converting leads into paying customers. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The third pillar is *buying*. All leads aren't created equal. You can build huge lists of unresponsive people. Paid traffic is powerful but dangerous. It can generate large volumes of low-intent leads. You build an audience, but not fans. The Daily Client Machine solves this. It builds an audience *and* partitions leads into customers. There are two components: the big idea and the customer offer. Run a simple funnel: ad to landing page to sales page. My ad: "Say goodbye to sales calls." My landing page:

> "Get the exact GDoc template that sold $802,000 of consulting without a sales call."
 80% of landing page results come from the headline. This converts at over 40%, leads are $2.50, and customer purchases pay for the ads. ## Buying an Audience: Leveraging the Daily Client Machine **Summary:** James Kemp explains how the Daily Client Machine can be used for organic growth and shares examples of its implementation, emphasizing the importance of the welcome email in setting expectations. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Get to the template, then the sales page with a customer offer. This is the most efficient way to grow an audience, leads, and convert to customers quickly. It solves the problem of thousands of leads and finding the few who will buy. Turn them into customers early. The Daily Client Machine can also grow organically. Mine go in my social media bios. I still get 20 sign-ups a day. Pay attention to the welcome email. It sets the scene and expectations, and how they can become a customer or client. These are the three ways. An audience is a long-term investment. Short-term actions create long-term results. Think long-term, but manage expectations. Returns are nonlinear. ## A Comprehensive Audience Building Plan **Summary:** James Kemp provides a practical plan for building both a large and high-quality audience, combining elements of borrowing, building, and buying. He emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective and managing expectations. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** People want instant clients from social media and ads. That's not how it works. Borrowing an audience is fastest for trust transfer, but lowest volume. A good plan: *Borrow*: Turn up twice a month to teach. *Build*: Post three times a week on primary and secondary platforms. *Buy*: Run the Daily Client Machine with a $50/day budget, two-step lead magnet, and $100 customer offer. This builds a large, high-quality audience, filters for ready buyers, creates trust transfer, and generates volume. The mixture is up to you. ## Reaching Out to Borrow an Audience **Summary:** James Kemp provides advice on how to approach someone to borrow their audience, suggesting a simple and effective script focused on offering value and demonstrating what's working now. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Everyone got the doc? Is there a script? No.
