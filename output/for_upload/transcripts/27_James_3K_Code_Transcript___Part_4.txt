# James 3K Code Transcript - Part 4

. Right? James Kemp: The currency is money. the way I do it is unique to me. James Kemp: Emily's currency is money, the way she does it is unique to her. James Kemp: Your currency is money. the way you do it is unique to you. James Kemp: So you're encapsulating. But the core people. There. James Kemp: you're encapsulating the how. James Kemp: in terms of a differentiation, if you . Gieo: In that. Yeah. Gieo: I see. Okay, to build James Kemp: our goal is a million dollar health consulting practice. James Kemp: or our goal is building a million dollar lifestyle health practitioner with 100 clients or less or 10 HA week on the tools or whatever it is. Right? Gieo: Yeah, yeah. Gieo: it is in less and less time, more money and less time. Gieo: So yeah, that makes a lot of sense what you just pointed out there. Gieo: And he, he II think it's always a nuance to our, to our audience as well, because II certainly use., your framework, which was super helpful. Santa saved a huge amount of time. Gieo: And of course I changed the wording because pumping out cash. I don't. That's not the way that my people say it. I don't think it made me think that. So I change. Gieo: the nuance of what they want in in my, in my community, I said, everybody wants money, but but in my community, I think people want time more than anything, more more time, freedom. James Kemp: Yeah, the the core. James Kemp: People say they want more. People say they want more time, but they want money. James Kemp: So they because they think they can buy it. Gieo: Okay. James Kemp: So if you default to more money Gieo: and the methodology gives them more money in less time. James Kemp: Then it's a it's a safer default. Bet that the market accepts. Gieo: Yeah. Gieo: Oh, good. Well, thank you. Thanks for the feedback. And I said, I have Gieo: obviously been working with you for a bit, and got so much value out of this, and I hear something a little bit different each time. And and of course, as I'm building my own content and everything. So this whole piece about what is the core offer. II think there, I think there's layers of meaning in it. James Kemp: And there's la, there's always laser, meaning everything. And I'm, and I'm being overly simplistic today on purpose. James Kemp: because you can obfuscate all of these things James Kemp: and call it nuance right. But when we get to the core of the reason for the offer existing, and you being oriented towards the market, there's layers and layers of why you won't do that. Well, you can't do that. James Kemp: But the core pieces. What are you in the business of? James Kemp: And then adding your own unique. Spin to it. Gieo: Yeah. Gieo: Well, the the thing that I'll say to you before I jump off here, is that the other piece Gieo: just to affirm and confirm Gieo: is the commitment, so I will do what was prescribed, and I recommend other people do as well. So I will put an offer out to at least 10 people, probably a bunch more. Gieo: And I'll I'll report back. James Kemp: Yeah. Got some sales last week? Right? So you're you've got your James Kemp: thank you, sir

. So I will put an offer out to at least 10 people, probably a bunch more. Gieo: And I'll I'll report back. James Kemp: Yeah. Got some sales last week? Right? So you're you've got your James Kemp: thank you, sir. James Kemp: Mr. Calvert. Louis Calvert: Hello! This offer, this core stuff has been really helpful for me., I realized that I was Louis Calvert: mixing mine up a bit, obviously with the aligned offer, the aligned coach. Louis Calvert: I was selling money. I know that's what I'm selling. But then I started. I probably started to bleed in some confusion around Louis Calvert: living a better life or something. So that's helped, but my question super simple stuff, was around. Just a little bit of clarification on some of the things. Louis Calvert: one was you said at the end. There about validating Louis Calvert: if you haven't got too many. I'm not sure if it was. If you haven't got too many people to ask, or just as a general thing, to cold outreach 10 people on certain on any platform. Louis Calvert: Was that with the offer to validate the offer? Is that something alongside that? James Kemp: Yeah, to to to drive a conversation. Validation, validating is giving it to someone who wants to see it. It's not giving us. James Kemp: So it's driving a conversation with those people. Louis Calvert: So, yeah, yeah, just just normal cold, cold outreach. Have a conversation and get to the point to to then ask that James Kemp: that question. That message that you put. Yeah, if you need to. James Kemp:, for some people here, they don't need to turn for many others. They got to scramble together 10 people to to get something in front of them. Louis Calvert: Yeah, yeah. Cause I'm just trying to take it all at at face value and do a exactly. And yeah, I was thinking, if we're going straight in with that message cold, it probably Louis Calvert: isn't good data to only do 10 right, but now I get it. Louis Calvert: There was 2 more little questions. Did that you decided not to have a promise not to have a guarantee not to have a Louis Calvert: something else is that that's probably not something you'd suggest for most people. Right? James Kemp: Correct? Yeah. James Kemp: And when when I, when I, when I look at the nuance of that promise versus James Kemp: the guarantee, if you . they're quite different things Louis Calvert: right? And under my guarantee I say James Kemp: no promises, no guarantees, no refunds. So I class that as a guarantee Louis Calvert: and then final little question Louis Calvert: just going along the lines of the prescriptions. And if we were to do a 12 week or a 12 month community offer. Would you suggest to have any commitment at all, or just they join, and then they can't come back in if they leave Louis Calvert: for 12 months. James Kemp: I found I again I found, the clear pieces. James Kemp: the kindest one for everybody, which is this is to get the things you want., when we've got a big enough ambition. James Kemp: then there's going to take 12 months James Kemp: if you don't want to. You can stop at any time. James Kemp: It's not a hostage situation, it's the language I use. James Kemp: but they, if you decide to leave. James Kemp: then this is the consequence. Louis Calvert: Cool? Yeah, I think I'll go with that as well

., when we've got a big enough ambition. James Kemp: then there's going to take 12 months James Kemp: if you don't want to. You can stop at any time. James Kemp: It's not a hostage situation, it's the language I use. James Kemp: but they, if you decide to leave. James Kemp: then this is the consequence. Louis Calvert: Cool? Yeah, I think I'll go with that as well. Louis Calvert: That's the only reason I joined Syndica. I was II joined because there was no guarantee, not thinking that I'd stick around so long. And then I've James Kemp: I'm not planning on leaving anytime soon. Louis Calvert: Yeah. that was me. That was me. Just some simple questions. Thank you. James Kemp: who feels stuck on what to include. James Kemp:, what actual, what to include in terms of training James Kemp: calls community, etc. James Kemp: Because this is that that's the piece that probably people go away and overthink. James Kemp: What do I put in it? And James Kemp: in my now vast experience most people put too much in James Kemp: right, and that so again, I oversimplified it down to James Kemp: you, need some training and some videos and some templates to get people to follow to a process., these are the things these are the tools. Here's the work I've done for you. You need to. James Kemp: Here here they are, get to to do on your own a community and then calls to do it. James Kemp: Is anyone stuck on what to include in there. James Kemp: and a community aura or a client also. Russell Pearson: Oh, I am James James Kemp: Cool. Russell Pearson: So I've got my current community is the forge. I've got about 20 clients in there, and we've got Russell Pearson: 4 calls a week. We do some one on one work strategic plans and the . Russell Pearson: But I'm looking at this other community piece is being a step down from that, because. Russell Pearson: yeah, the the forge is pretty much all access to me. So I'm stepping down, thinking all right. Well, one call a week. What does the Q. And a. Call look ? Do I do education? Because when I first started doing this years back. Russell Pearson: education just set people running in different directions rather than sticking to a, a plan? Russell Pearson: and because I'm not technically working with them and working through their plan. Russell Pearson: And this is probably just me now. I'm not sure that I can get them the results Russell Pearson: without working with them. James Kemp: Yeah. Russell Pearson: So the the point is, what would I put into a downgrade of the forge? I guess James Kemp: so. How many calls a week are you running? Russell Pearson: Did you say? Full James Kemp: fall? So a downgrade of the forge could give them access to the community. One call a week and the training library. Russell Pearson: Yeah, okay? And currently the let's say, the payment plan is 1750. Russell Pearson: Yeah. And it's a so 21 total year. And if you're talking, maybe 100 or a hundred 50 a week. Russell Pearson: That's the community piece. James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: lots of people having great results unbundling their main programs that. James Kemp: So they, my recommendation would be offer them a one-on-one call as a bonus to get started, just I do James Kemp: have go

. Russell Pearson: Yeah. And it's a so 21 total year. And if you're talking, maybe 100 or a hundred 50 a week. Russell Pearson: That's the community piece. James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: lots of people having great results unbundling their main programs that. James Kemp: So they, my recommendation would be offer them a one-on-one call as a bonus to get started, just I do James Kemp: have go. James Kemp: I'm running an experiment for 5 people on a founders offer who want access to all my James Kemp: all my trainings and a little bit of access to me, and one access to the amazing community and the for the first 5 people. It's a hundred bucks a week. James Kemp: because it's about driving velocity James Kemp: and ultimately driving more clients. James Kemp: And then you could raise it up to to be more., closer James Kemp: to 50% of what the current James Kemp: offers. This. Which is a good ratio. So you're at 1750. So that's about 3, 50, James Kemp: 3, 50 a week. James Kemp: So if you raise that up to 100 5,200 for the community only offer. James Kemp: then you get plenty of people upgrading to the to the forge. Russell Pearson: Yeah, cool and the and so is there any nuance or any mistakes that I could make by Russell Pearson:, I'm thinking, from the scaling point of view, by Russell Pearson: offering people at that lower price point where they just get in for lifetime value. Russell Pearson: I guess it's just the boundaries that you're talking about. Just don't go, allowing them into one on one stuff and outside of any specific office. James Kemp: Yeah, no, just don't make exceptions. James Kemp: which is the key piece to to client delivery businesses, which might be exceptions, but might themselves have to scale and stressful. James Kemp: And I, when you when you can approach the the nuance with the messaging would be James Kemp: very clear, it's 1,750 a month to work with me in the forge for that. You get lots of access to me. Lots of people just want access to my James Kemp: training and methodologies and a little bit of access and and and a community of support. If you're self-directed, then this might be for you. James Kemp: and then it's very clear that if I want more of you. I can just Russell Pearson: always 1 one. Yeah. Great fantastic. Appreciate that James Kemp: cool. James Kemp: Yeah, just to still it down., there's a number of programs going out there right now, 2,000, 402,500, James Kemp: and then offering, access to the community element. And and I'm bundling, and James Kemp: they're upgrading a ton of people right? Because that that easy weekly pricing makes it easy to get started to upgrade to the thing. James Kemp: And that's the Bolton. That's the Bolton approach. The community offer can be a lower, a lower level entry level on the 2 main program. James Kemp: Any more questions. Emily Utter: I have a question about what I'm including, cause I think maybe I didn't quite do it right. Not right. But what . James Kemp: Hmm. Emily Utter: but arcs. Hand is up, too. Emily Utter: Should I go ahead or wait? Got it? Emily Utter: Okay? So I wanted to do mine where I wasn't promising every single week, cause

. James Kemp: Any more questions. Emily Utter: I have a question about what I'm including, cause I think maybe I didn't quite do it right. Not right. But what . James Kemp: Hmm. Emily Utter: but arcs. Hand is up, too. Emily Utter: Should I go ahead or wait? Got it? Emily Utter: Okay? So I wanted to do mine where I wasn't promising every single week, cause. I love to have weeks where I don't have a lot of calls, so I can gallivant right? So Emily Utter: I Emily Utter: set it as 2 calls a week, the first 3 weeks of the month, and then also it's 6 QA type calls. But I probably do a little content at the beginning of each one just riff on whatever, and then one monthly workshop. Emily Utter: and then plus community. And the way that I priced it right now is they can either choose weekly or monthly, 2, 50 a week, or 1,000 a month. That's really low compared to what I normally charge for a mastermind. Emily Utter: and yeah, II can tell. There's II feel something's off with that., I just launched it today. 10 people have heard the offer so I could change it. But that's how I presented it today. James Kemp: Just, you're you're in the. You're in the game there. It's a it's a ton of access. It's a ton of value. And you've been very. It's a ton of access to me. And but I am just questioning it a bit, I guess because Emily Utter: I just because it is so different from how I normally price Emily Utter: and Emily Utter: I do see, clear, higher offers., though, what I decided was, I'll create the higher tier offer later, and then allow people to upgrade from within. Emily Utter: And then maybe in the future, they could start at the higher tier. Emily Utter: but yeah, I guess partly. I'm a little nervous about the people who pay weekly. But then there'll be weeks where there isn't a call at all. But obviously I'm giving them a ton of my programs in the membership site. They'll have the community which I'm still having the feels about . I don't want to answer everyone's questions at that price point. But as a client I want my questions answered. So I'm . Emily Utter: I to sell something I would buy. James Kemp: Yeah, I get that. But if you don't want to answer questions on the community, say you don't answer questions in the community Emily Utter: right? Eventually, when there's a lot of people in there, I would hire somebody to do that. That's easy. I've done it many times. But okay, so Emily Utter: I don't know that just it feels something's off. You don't think so, though. Okay. Emily Utter: cool. Well, my goal is 20 people. James Kemp: The thing that feels office, that you've included stuff that you you don't want to do, which is us answering questions in the community. Emily Utter: I left it, unclear, I said, it's a peer community. I didn't say that I would answer anything. We'll say you don't answer anything, but my people are used to me answering or having a team member answer. James Kemp: There is no such thing as people who are used to anything. Emily Utter: Well, yes, there is. You can recalibrate boundaries with anybody at any time. Emily Utter: And people choose to accept them or not. So relationships always work Emily Utter: private. Yeah

. I didn't say that I would answer anything. We'll say you don't answer anything, but my people are used to me answering or having a team member answer. James Kemp: There is no such thing as people who are used to anything. Emily Utter: Well, yes, there is. You can recalibrate boundaries with anybody at any time. Emily Utter: And people choose to accept them or not. So relationships always work Emily Utter: private. Yeah. Emily Utter: And as you go along, you can change and and and recalibrate the offer. James Kemp: because you're making a particular promise to a particular group of people that you can recalibrate Emily Utter: right? So the first 5 people might get under this. But you . As you move along you realize that there's there's better ways to do it. James Kemp: I'm I'm shifting some of the delivery and the syndicate, because there are better ways to do it Emily Utter: right right. Emily Utter: But you're not taking anything away that we got promised when we joined right. Yeah. Emily Utter: okay. James Kemp: I would if I had a damn good reason, and not everyone's going to buy the reason. But if if I had a good reason I'd take stuff away. Emily Utter: Yeah. Emily Utter: okay. Emily Utter: thank you. James Kemp: But again, it's the core of, if you're clear with yourself, then you're clear with people, and they respect it James Kemp: people might not James Kemp: boundaries. James Kemp: but they respect them. Emily Utter: Yeah, I think it's just new offer jitters, I'm, I know my first people who buy are gonna be people who've been buying from me for years. That's who's gonna join us. So it's gonna be different for them. That's that's my expectation. At least, that's people who know me are gonna buy first. Yep. Emily Utter: yeah. Emily Utter: Yeah. Thanks. Cool. James Kemp: good time for one more. Yeah. Arc: Cool. Arc: I realize where the my core offer gone off. I showed it to some people, and they just didn't get good responses from it. And but I realized that I had and I'm I'm really glad you went over the core part, because I at first had started with focusing on the money, and then I switched, and I was trying to, pack all these things in there. Arc: And what I realized is, II do the marketing aspect, and get them clear on that and the monetization and everything but one of the big things that my focus is the the metaphysical part. And I'm wondering that's gonna be in there, anyway, in the community. But I'm wondering if I should even put that in the Arc: the main offer. Arc: But I feel it's directly relevant to people making more money, getting out of their subconscious blocks and getting stepping more into the power and being able to speak the truth, be authentic. Quick. Second guessing themselves. Arc: so I guess my question is . does that make sense to plug into one of the 3, one of the core steps that we go over. Arc: Okay. okay, cool. James Kemp: It doesn't. It doesn't need to be relevant. Then it just needs to be congruent with the people you're talking to. Right? Yeah.. James Kemp: there are many, many ways that people could get help to have a million dollar consulting business right? Hire a team and do this and this. I have my way James Kemp: right? So my way as congruent James Kemp: to me. James Kemp: very, very relevant to me
