# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 2

dogs on the beach I want to spend time with my soon to be new wife and the the the young man's game is the fastest way to make money because you can deploy a lot of energy into it you can get people on the phone you can hustle you can grind you can do all those things and you make a ton of money and you might want to keep doing that or you might want to take it to the next level where you start hiring people you build a sales team to sell that you hire coaches to coach the people you hire Consultants to consult to the people etc etc that is the scalable part and what you will see in that path is that growth starts to slow down because your operations get larger you spend more money on things marketing and advertising there you you lose a little bit of contact with the clients so you not don't have your finger on the post because you're not the one selling and you're not the one Consulting and coaching at the mpce so the business starts to slow down so that time when you're the one on the phone selling that time when you're the only one coaching Etc is the fastest growth period and it's also the hardest because you have to be everything and the reason that I choose to go slowly and don't understand what the situation I'm in I've been doing this for a long time I've made a ton of money I have very strong cash flow I have very strong recurring Revenue so I can afford to go slowly but I also choose to go slowly I choose the old man's game I choose the slower smoother path because it has low stress it allows me to put the energy into places that that that matter and I lost sight for many years that the business was there to feed my life and I had many trade-offs in the course of when the kids were young and in my previous marriage Etc where it was growth at all cost that I would take the call even if it was the right thing wasn't the right thing for me and all of us because I was chasing the sale and I was chasing the deal even well past the point where I didn't need to do that I didn't need the money and I was on that Relentless Pursuit and that was costly it has been very costly I don't regret a single bit of it because it got me to where I am now which is in a wonderful spot but in in hindsight there were there were trade-offs that I that I tolerated for too long in that model and I'm saying this because I speak to a ton of people every day that can't let go of that because they're just on that Relentless cycle of trying to beat last month oh we did 200k last month and if we don't do 250 this month then it's all a disaster and it's whatever whatever story they're telling themselves I've heard them all and I'm saying this because there is a choice if you want to go fast I am not your guy if you want to go the fastest route which is getting on calls and closing people and selling to everybody who remotely resembles the your ideal target market then I'm not your guy there are there are really good people out there who do that day in day out and they run that model themselves and then they they also teach that model themselves some of them are speaking to me about how much they hate it but they still teach it so that's just between you and I but the the fact is that there are trade-offs in that model it is the fastest it's got some serious trade offs and it's got some serious downsides that that only become apparent while doing it but you know what I'm damn glad I did it the the 1500 odd sales skills I did made me damn good at selling it made me damn good at offer creation it may be damnn good at content and May and they're a very fast feedback loop so the old adage that slow as smooth and smooth as fast is very much true for me these days you

the fastest it's got some serious trade offs and it's got some serious downsides that that only become apparent while doing it but you know what I'm damn glad I did it the the 1500 odd sales skills I did made me damn good at selling it made me damn good at offer creation it may be damnn good at content and May and they're a very fast feedback loop so the old adage that slow as smooth and smooth as fast is very much true for me these days you can have an offer that which has a defined product promise a defined path and it defined specifics around it with pricing Etc that you can put in a Google doc a text document on a relatively pretty landing page and still make sales with that it will be slower and many cases you'll get better people because they will spend more time considering your content considering the offer and considering the promises you're making or not making in the case of it so it is a harder sell but by the time you've sold someone if you're more patient then the type of people you get tend to be more patient as well and in it for the long haul so the absolute fastest way isn't isn't necessarily the best way and this is where your discernment on who you're following what you work with and what strategies you use are ultimately down to your what you want and what you expect and what you need from your life because every single strategy out there that someone's selling works there are better people out there to follow and better people to invest in who have very much got it dialed in and and are much better teachers than others and there are people who will sell you things that work in fundamentals but they don't know how they work in principles so they don't they're not great at presenting it again discernment is required for me at the stage of life I'm at and the commitments I have the the selling from docs making content sending emails every day making these videos Etc it takes longer to get results and it takes longer than it would do if I was on the phone I would make triple the money that I do these days than if if I was taking calls and selling on the phone or if I decided to build a sales team and those things what if I built a sales team I'd probably make exactly the same profit and just have much much higher our overheads and just a much shorter sales cycle that's the reality so all to say there is a fast way I don't do it you may choose to do it but go in and choose the strategies that you're thinking about the the the market and the methods that you're going to use very carefully and think about the fact that I believe fundamentally your business is there to feed your life so if your business is sucking the life out of you then you might want to think about it but if your business is feeding your life you've got the time the money the energy to do the things you want then you're definitely on the right path Coaches: You Do Not Sell 'Confidence' or 'Clarity' just got off a workshop and getting ready for boxing apparently I'm getting better so got all the space to do it so had a workshop this morning about 85 people came and it was about content and as usual the usual folks turn up it's about half coaches and then half people who do other stuff and of the coaches about 50% of the people who work with me I'm going to sit down 50% of the people work with me sell money business coaches right and so business coaches people go well it's really easy to make a promise if you're a business coach who you sell money because it's tangible and how do James how do I improve my offer because it's easy for business coaches they can just help people make more money and that is true it is easy to make a clear offer about making more money I will help you make $100,000 give me $110,000 oversimplification but that works but there were

me sell money business coaches right and so business coaches people go well it's really easy to make a promise if you're a business coach who you sell money because it's tangible and how do James how do I improve my offer because it's easy for business coaches they can just help people make more money and that is true it is easy to make a clear offer about making more money I will help you make $100,000 give me $110,000 oversimplification but that works but there were a lot of people there who sold personal development healing Fitness and these things which are in their eyes less tangible and I've had this for years and ironically some of my most successful clients over the years don't sell money they don't sell business coaching they don't sell strategy they sold help they sold personal development they sold Fitness and the reason they were successful is I helped them make their office tangible and one of the things that and if you're selling personal development selling Fitness Etc is that people talk about I sell confidence or I sell Clarity and you don't you cannot sell those things because they are outcomes of doing things right you do not need to have Clarity on how to become a millionaire you just need to do the things that are required to become a millionaire you do not need to believe and have the confidence that you can become a millionaire you just need to do the things that are required to have it there is plenty of unconfident millionaires but in the course of selling personal development lots of people default to I help people become more confident I help people with Clarity and the correlation the causation is just really the wrong way around because people become Confident by taking action being consistent with that action I

. E not lying to themselves and their confidence develops but again pepper throughout this I've said the word doing an action right so if you're in the personal development space if you're selling Fitness or anything that Fitness is a little bit easier because you can be tangible about muscle gain or fat loss or specific performance metrics but if you're in the personal development space you are not in the business of selling confidence and Clarity you are in the business of selling specific actions that that person has confidence in that if they do that action that on the other side they will get more confidence and more clarity so a a tangible example the other factor of these examples is that there needs to be an incentive for people to do it people don't just seek to improve themselves without an incentive people don't seek to heal trauma without an incentive so someone who came on the workshop today they help people with trauma and we talked about specific sexual trauma and one of the things that people with those traumas have is they tend to heal that trauma when they have an incentive to do so and the incentive is I'm absolutely sick to death of living this and I've reached the end of my tolerance for this so therefore I want to live a better life the other one is they enter a relationship where the cost of the trauma they see the direct cost of the trauma affecting their relationship so therefore they seek they have a high incentive to heal that trauma and so I said to her two things firstly you need to talk to the incentive if you're in a relationship you want to heal your heal your traa now is the time so you talk to the the symptoms of of of these things coming up you talk to the your content talks to the symptoms of that your trauma is getting in the way of your intimacy that your trauma is pushing your partner away and here's an example of someone who did that and they lost their relationship but here's an example who of someone who used my XYZ me mechanism prev and they went from pushing their partner away because of their trauma to to welcome and and then them enjoying intimacy every day so the tangible things are okay you need an incentive to do it but you also need to take tangible action and this is where mechanisms come in you are not selling the outcomes you are selling the mechanisms that people do so with my terrific trauma protocol in in 30 days you'll heal your trauma so you can have more confidence more intimacy and more on on the other side you are never in the business of selling the things that are on the other side of something you are in the business of selling the the mechanisms that go into it because that allows people to see what you sell and what you buy what they are buying and allows you to differentiate in the market for people who are talking about these things of confidence you can't point at those things to say this is a mechanism it does this in this period of time you're going to invest in this mechanism because you have the incentive to do so because you're in a relationship or you're sick to death of the the the thing that you're doing so all offers and all messages can become tangible if you point out the things that happen as an outcome a tangible pointable result confidence so you can have a better relationship or you point at a tangible mechanism that people have an input through because if you keep talking in these generic woolly terms about oh yeah people will become more confident when they work with me and people that then you're confusing what people buy and you're confusing the ultimate outcomes that you derive because those outcomes are a bu product of the action and the work that people ultimately do so selling supposedly intangible things becomes very simple when you point at things that they are buying you point at incentives that they have to to do it right now and you point at ultimately the distinct outcomes that they have and those outcomes monetary outcomes are are easy for people to Value but outcomes that are behavioral or or that show up in people's lives so you can have more intimacy every day be become much more tangible than these

because those outcomes are a bu product of the action and the work that people ultimately do so selling supposedly intangible things becomes very simple when you point at things that they are buying you point at incentives that they have to to do it right now and you point at ultimately the distinct outcomes that they have and those outcomes monetary outcomes are are easy for people to Value but outcomes that are behavioral or or that show up in people's lives so you can have more intimacy every day be become much more tangible than these generic ideas every offer can be made tangible it just requires a little bit of looking and and know stepping back from the mixing up of the of the correlation and the causation of the work that you do I personally help people make money they do the work and they they get the outcomes and they get the benefits and they use that money to do things you know which is the a lot of the other stuff I talk about they do use that money to live a better life but at the end of the day I point at the outcomes I point the mechanism and I point at the things that that people can see and value and that works no matter what you sell What's Working in 2025 To Get High Ticket Clients I ran my first Facebook ad in 2017 so I guess I'm a veteran back in the back in the day when you were own a Facebook ad you could get a booked call and sell someone a very expensive you know Consulting program for about 50 in the time New Zealand dollars so you could run an ad get someone to a vsl convince them that you knew what you were talking about understand what they needed prove prove that you understand what they needed get them on a call and sell them a $22 to $10,000 Consulting program and people still do that to this day and it doesn't cost $50 anymore and everybody I talked to who still runs core funnels and still runs ads to them always report costs going up the only exception in this and one of the biggest Moes that people have these days is someone with a brand if you've got a large person brand a large brand on YouTube or on Instagram or one of those where people are pre-sold on you then you book a core funnels and these things still really work most people don't have a large personal brand Everybody's Got a Brand but most people don't have a large manufactured intentional personal brand and so in 2025 you are steering into the headwinds of a low trust environment the fact is that lots of people have been making lots of big bold crazy in many cases unrealistic promises and we are in a low trust environment and back 10 years ago just your Boomer parents would believe every sing single thing on the news people believed every single thing they saw on the internet and they bought the claims they bought the promises and they bought into everything and you know you could pretty much sell anything these days we are in a very low trust environment and that means the the marketing and the force that people are putting into marketing to try and convince people of those things is a it's less effective because we're in a low trust environment and B there's just way more people doing it so the the the signal to noise ratio has changed dramatically and so that brings us to the present day so 24 hours ago I ran a workshop and on that Workshop ironically I showed people my workshop process of how I sell Workshop tickets for $100 and how I generate multiple thousand High ticket customers off the back of that and one of the things that we did in the Q&A so we went for about 2 and a half hours and about half of that is teaching and about half of that is just Q&A where I just help people one of the things I said in that environment is that we have to give people an experience the days are are are they're not gone but they're coming to an end where people will be nurtured through a multi step funnel where they'll see lots and lots of pieces of content and eventually

of the things that we did in the Q&A so we went for about 2 and a half hours and about half of that is teaching and about half of that is just Q&A where I just help people one of the things I said in that environment is that we have to give people an experience the days are are are they're not gone but they're coming to an end where people will be nurtured through a multi step funnel where they'll see lots and lots of pieces of content and eventually do something and eventually book a cool people are far more cynical and far more skeptical and they're far more preserv preserving of their time so it's never cost more to generate get someone to a webinar and and sell them on the webinar it's never cost more to get someone to book a call and so in the in a low trust environment what do you do you have to allow people to prove things to themselves with their very own eyes and we do this through experience so yesterday on that Workshop I sold the tickets to that workshop for $9 $9 is a no-brainer price I sold hundreds and hundreds of tickets and just over 100 people turned up at the peak and a lot of people catching it on the replay today and and and reaching out to me and what I did on that Workshop was give people an experience if because I allow people on the workshop to ask me a question to get help from me I'm giving them a small small taste of what it might be to work with me what it might be to be able to rent my brain once or twice a week which I allow people to do in my client programs and through that experience they can build up their own judgment by having that experience I could say 50 things to these people and prove case studies and prove this and prove that and they would look at them with skepticism but I can do more and give more experience in a 60c conversation or even someone witnessing a 60 second conversation than I can with my giving people information and showing them all the way and that's all marketing is really doing it's trying to shift beliefs through information and showing people things and tell and telling them as well and in 2025 the thing that's going to work is to give people experience that is why I'm prepared to do things drop my pants if you for $9 by selling a workshop ticket so cheap just to allow people to give that experience and 42 people signed up to something off the back of that workshop for something else between 50 and $750 a week because I gave them an experience and so if you are good at what you do this should be very very exciting because you were sitting on assets that you can allow people to experience and you shouldn't be too worried about what you sell those assets for as long as you have those assets leading to another asset I am quite happy to sell $9 Workshop tickets because I'll sign the best people up to join my membership or get be coached by me or join The Syndicate and get access to me I'd be quite happy to do that because it leads to something else and even if someone goes away you know and they got multiple times what they thought in terms of value of $9 even if they don't buy something there's some Goodwill in the market I've delivered I've overd delivered relative to what they paid and the time they dedicated so Marketing in 2025 isn't marketing you know it's demonstration and its experience it's giving people the experience of what it could be to do this and you could do this through low ticket products you could do it through AI tools you could do it through workshops you can do it through any experience where someone interacts with you these days I'd be much more mindful to sell a Consulting call than I would to book a free sales call I think it's far more targeted and valuable valuable for someone I think it's far more insightful and experiential for someone and you're far more likely to get a great long term client out of
