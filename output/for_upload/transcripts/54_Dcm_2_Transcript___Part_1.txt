# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 1

## # Processed Transcript ## Introduction & Welcome Hey! Peeps

# Processed Transcript ## Introduction & Welcome Hey! Peeps. I seem to have zoom open twice. I don't even know how that's possible, but it's working. Just wait a minute while you'll roll in. I'll drop the usual in the chat. It's about the dock and this one is going to expand as we go along, so add add some ads and other things as we go along, because it's a pretty dynamic dynamic funnel. So the daily client machine how's that for size? The the font. Good. I know these Google docs are good, good, good. So. Jim Tyrrell: Good enough. James Kemp: Good enough, that's all we need. So daily flight machine coming up to coming up to 7 years old in terms of in terms of a concept and the market is the same and different in many ways. But what hasn't changed is that, market dynamics are exactly that the distribution of a market is exactly that so client serving businesses are set up to serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace won't become a client. and over a long enough time period. If we quote unquote nurture people long enough and stay consistent, then clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. And what you find is that on average people will. turn one to 5% of their audience., and that's a broad metric into a client. So, you get a thousand people. You get a thousand leads, and, over time you get 10 to 30 clients out of a pretty common ratios. And there's 2 issues with this that it's really inefficient. If you're not selling to 990 or 970 people that you've, got the attention of, captured the details off and got the permission to talk to. Then that's it's a large portion of wastage.

## The Problem with Long Sales Cycles and the other factor is that there is no determinant of how long it's going to take. I've had scenarios where I've generated a lead 5 years ago before someone did that. If that was a planned sales cycle, then fine. I'm not a real estate agent, and I'd it to be a little bit shorter. Long sales. Cycles are very hard to scale. and so to get things to grow or to have control over something. We need something that is scalable because scale is a byproduct of, control. If we want to scale something up, we have to have control over something that works. And if we want to scale something down, we have to have the control over it as well. So we must have efficient ways to to identify who is most likely to become a client as early as possible. plus. It's useful to generate cash along the way as you invest to grow anything we need to invest, we need to invest time, or we need to invest money. We need to invest energy in both of those. And so as we go along, it's useful to generate cash flow from the energy that we put into our content our marketing, our lead generation, our advertising and everything in that category. And the power ladder is, undefeated that one to, for most people 3% is the number one to 3% of people in your audience, become a client, and will give you large amounts of money and will agree to have a level of transformation. There are people who just get coaching get mentorship do that consistently over long periods of time. They value being in proximity to people who are doing similar things to them. And they understand that. That's how you progress. It's much less about the things you do. It's about the people you're around and the other factor is that there is no determinant of how long it's going to take. I've had scenarios where I've generated a lead 5 years ago before someone did that. If that was a planned sales cycle, then fine. I'm not a real estate agent, and I'd it to be a little bit shorter.

## Audience Segmentation & Lead Generation coming down from that. There are people who will invest intermittently. . They might buy a program here, an event here, a short coaching course, here a mastermind, and come into a free period and come out. Those people, are there. They are valuable to you, and you are valuable to them on the journey, and I see a lot of people going and talking, or being coached by one of my friends, and then coming back to me, and then going away again to do something else. And and they we don't have a linear path, but they are in my world for months and years. and then we have everybody else who will buy things spasmodically. They'll buy things occasionally, or they'll buy one thing and never buy another thing. But they might stick around in your audience, and there might be people who a big advocate of you I've got. I can think of lots of scenarios and people who fit these criteria. And so traditional lead generation has just been a game of large numbers, feed a thousand people on the top, nurture them while each one drops off. Get 30 clients at the other end if you could. and it's pretty wasteful, and it's pretty inefficient, and over time as we're seeing now. And a lot of people, especially if you're selling money or transformation fitness coaching as well. It's just harder because there's more people doing it. There's more, there's more cynicism, there's more blindness in the market, and it's just harder to to. It's harder to get clients. It's harder to capture attention. It's harder to differentiate. And over time no systems that waste most of their output have stood the test of time.

## The Dual-Mode Funnel Concept And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, download a lead magnet, and, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, people, are always looking for the best funnel. And, one of my most annoying phrases is, everything works right but who it's for? And when are the other determinants? And searching for the best funnel is is one of those endless ones when the constraints are predetermined. So the traditional lead generation of get a lead nurture, nurture, nurture. Watch people drop off and get a client works. It still works. but it's hard to scale. It's expensive. You need to be very good. And and ultimately it's not going to work forever. So something I've been working on for the past couple of months is bringing the 2 distinct approaches together. So dual mode client generation is a singular idea, deployed in in the same funnel with 2 different funnel types. So what we really want is clients, right? We can use those who won't immediately become clients to fund our marketing to get clients. That's the I think it's a little bit of a black pill. That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you . There are lots of people who are going to buy low ticket products from you, and will never become a client, but they'll give you cash flow to go and find clients right? So what we really want is clients. And what we really want is that the efficient way to do that? So this funnel monetizes IP that we've already got, we can use those who who won't immediately become clients to fund the acquisition of them, and we shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness of prospects. And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, download a lead magnet, and, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, people, are always looking for the best funnel. And, one of my most annoying phrases is, everything works right but who it's for? And when are the other determinants? And searching for the best funnel is is one of those endless ones when the constraints are predetermined. So the traditional lead generation of get a lead nurture, nurture, nurture. Watch people drop off and get a client works. It still works. but it's hard to scale. It's expensive. You need to be very good. And and ultimately it's not going to work forever. So something I've been working on for the past couple of months is bringing the 2 distinct approaches together.

That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you . There are lots of people who are going to buy low ticket products from you, and will never become a client, but they'll give you cash flow to go and find clients right? So what we really want is clients

## Implementation Steps

## Two Buying Types: Insight vs. Info So in a dual mode funnel we generate leads and customers, at the same time using the same idea, so that this is not which one is best. They both serve roles right? The traditional Vsl based funnel that generates a lead and gives someone some insight has a place the more modern., low ticket info buying products leading to a place has a place one isn't better than than the other. In certain circumstances, for for certain people one will outperform the other one, but they both have a role, and by using both at once we get the best of both worlds. So to understand why. which is important to me that you understand why these things work, below the strategic level is that there are lots of different ways that people buy stuff. Right? So I've identified 2 buying types that they both., fundamentally work on the same premise. We need people to consume our ideas and us to buy into them. Right? We need to sell people ideas before we sell them anything we need to people to buy into our ideas, to buy into working with us, and the key word, and which is not often used in the design and deployment of, lead generation and funnels is consume because one path a buyer can take is consuming information, deriving insight on how it could work for them. Then, taking the next step to put the insight into action. the other is purchasing information consuming it. Then taking the next step presented in the chain. So I gave an example recently where I had bought, quote unquote high ticket services from 2 different people in 2 different ways, one by going through a traditional funnel and watching some information and then reaching out to them, and the other by buying their products, consuming the contents of the products. And then, taking the next step and engaging their services right? Both of these types of consumption have a have different advantages. Free information has a distribution advantage putting content out on the Internet. So in a dual mode funnel we generate leads and customers, at the same time using the same idea, so that this is not which one is best. They both serve roles right?

And then, taking the next step and engaging their services right? Both of these types of consumption have a have different advantages. Free information has a distribution advantage putting content out on the Internet.

## Examples & Case Studies

## The Power of a Singular Idea in Dual Modes It's more likely to be consumed than it is. If it's behind a paywall paid information has attention and attention advantage. If people pay, they tend to pay attention right? And so putting information and insight in front of people using both at the same time, is the force multiplier. And this, gets above that. What is the one funnel. There isn't 1 funnel. There is understanding the principles behind, a singular idea, being deployed and deploying it in different modes. So the Dcm 2.0 deploys both at the same time. and we create the same. We take the same idea and create 2 funnels. Each funnel leads to an offer. The client. Funnel uses an insight path. So consumption of information, and the customer funnel uses an info path. Purchasing and consuming information right? So as always, it's much simpler to show you rather than tell you so. One of the things that is the most challenging with offers right when we're making offers is what precedes the offer? What happens around the offer that you're making? And we, when we look at Google Docs, we often look at the the offer. That's inside the Google Doc. But we need to understand what's happened before that. And we also need to understand what's happened after it as well. That's my, both my zooms going off at once. So the client funnel works with both organic content and paid traffic right? So the top of the funnel we have content and pre-selling content is about 2 different things. It's about consistency and understanding that there's only really 3 content types that we're putting out there. So pre-selling content does exactly that. It pre- sells them on. What can happen next. So the content types are our mechanisms. I will talk about the hybrid offer. I will show how it works. I'll give different examples to it. I will talk about the daily client machine. I'll show how it works. I'll give different examples to it.

## Content Strategy & World Building This pre-sells people on the ideas that these things work and gives them insight that it might work for them right? And so the other top content types are, the identity I talk about the sovereign consultant. I talk about the sovereign components and and the process, and especially with video based content. You are showing those things as well rather than just telling right? So where are you? What is the background? What world are you in. What's your philosophy? Who's around you? What is the day in the life, what is behind the scenes? Who are the characters? If you're on a refresher on those things, then it's in the authority training in the, in the membership. So the world building is., the things around you, and though they can be, stories, I do, stop marketing, start demonstrating as me, just talking about my experience and pointing something out and giving inside philosophy online coaching is dead. But there's lots of things that are more mechanistic here as well. That content, if we're doing it from a content way, then funnels them to a big idea. Video. And this is for all intents and purposes of Vsl. I don't call it a Vsl, because I have found. There's no actual formula that applies to each individual. There are particular formulas that apply to certain categories. If you're just selling coaching, there's a particular formula for that. If you're just selling agency, there's a particular formula for a Vsl that works really well, and a lot of those Vsls to be honest work very well in call funnels, but less well in insight funnels. So I frame my, big idea as a demo.

## Creating Your "Big Idea" Video (VSL) a demo of a system, the exact steps X and Y exhibit. So one of the key things here is, use the style that's native to you. My style is, I will formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver on my training. I'll formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver offers. And I'll formulate a Google Doc to also, use in my marketing. So a Google, Doc is native to the way that I work and the way I present, and the way I think. And so it's the native thing for me. I have a friend who uses, slides because that's how he does it. And he, draws on paper, and he draws on an ipad. I have a friend who goes piece straight to camera with no. no props or anything that, because that's how he does it, and that's how he delivers. And that's how his training work. So the net the native style is., is is native to you. For me, it's Google Docs, one of the dirty secrets about big ideas or Vsls, the headline drives 50% of the conversion. We only really need people to watch a couple of minutes of something to get them to take action, because the headline has framed whether they are interested and whether it's relevant to them at exact. At that exact time a lot of testing in these funnels goes back to the media, whereas the headline is the the thing that it says at the top of the page drives most of the the attention and the activity off the back of it. a demo of a system, the exact steps X and Y exhibit. So one of the key things here is, use the style that's native to you. My style is, I will formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver on my training. I'll formulate and write a Google Doc to deliver offers. And I'll formulate a Google Doc to also, use in my marketing. So a Google, Doc is native to the way that I work and the way I present, and the way I think. And so it's the native thing for me. I have a friend who uses, slides because that's how he does it. And he, draws on paper, and he draws on an ipad. I have a friend who goes piece straight to camera with no. no props or anything that, because that's how he does it, and that's how he delivers. And that's how his training work. So the net the native style is. you know, is is native to you. For me, it's Google Docs, one of the dirty secrets about big ideas or Vsls, the headline drives 50% of the conversion. We only really need people to watch a couple of minutes of something to get them to take action, because the headline has framed whether they are interested and whether it's relevant to them at exact. At that exact time a lot of testing in these funnels goes back to the media, whereas the headline is the the thing that it says at the top of the page drives most of the the attention and the activity off the back of it.

## Driving Conversations & Case Studies The the thing we're looking for is no more than a couple of minutes of consumption. And a big idea Video, if you've introduced it, and you've got the gist. Then people, can can get enough of the idea. There is at the start. We want to put a lot of volume through a big idea video. So when I launch one of these videos, I just have a button there which enables people to start chatting with me straight away. I want to have conversations with people. I'm not gonna automate anything. I'm not gonna put anything in the way to . try and qualify, or anything that. I just want to talk to people. Who are they? Why do they click it? Where are they now? Am I useful to them. And the the other major point is, use the messaging platform that's native to you. I used to use Facebook and Facebook messenger when when I get people to reach out. I'm barely on Facebook these days, so it would be a mistake to use it. So I send people to an Instagram chat. Or I can send people to email as well, which tends to be my preference. Preference these days. So I'm, I've I've this this video. Here was 44 min. I've got another one. That's 11. These worked for me because they're in their native format. Excuse me. then, we're, giving people a case study. It's the same idea. It's the same core concepts. But we're giving it, as as a 3rd party. insight is delivered via demonstration. People are saying, Okay, well, it works for James. Then can it works for this other guy, then can it work for me? So the follow up of that content is, show transformation by showing how the transformation is made. The same point that I use in the ultimate case study.
