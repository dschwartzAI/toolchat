# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 3

## Q&A: VSL Strategy Jarred Brown: Hi, mate! James Kemp: Hi jared. Jarred Brown: The couple of questions. If you don't mind going down the Vsl path a little bit deeper, so correct me if I'm wrong is the these. So. I went through Youtube as you're speaking, you're not linking that as a call to action inside of your Youtube knows, are you not. James Kemp: On some videos I am. There's about a dozen videos that I am. Jarred Brown: Okay. James Kemp: On the Daily on the daily videos. I'm linking to a membership of. Jarred Brown: Okay. So that would be the equivalent of tacky had a video that he unlisted and sent everyone there is that, the the equivalent, and, Dan Bolton, has one front of. James Kemp: Yeah, you can do it that way if you want to host it on on Youtube. Jarred Brown: Yeah, or you said, send them to a page and then have a button where they can directly go to Instagram. Start a conversation with me. Okay, Instagram. James Kemp: Could sit in your Instagram profile and your Facebook profile. It could sit in your email footer. Ultimately, if you wanted to. If you had an okay size audience and you didn't want to run paid traffic to it. You could still get, 30 to 50 views of that every day right, and get a and get a lead and a conversation, 2 to 3 conversations a day out of that. Jarred Brown: Yeah, okay, great. And you're just to confirm there's no opt in for that. It's just insight. It's just an inside video that they can watch, and if they find it powerful they can take the next step and go straight to the button. James Kemp: I I've found my preference. Both work right. My preference is to have a naked Vsl. Jarred Brown: Yeah, I agree. James Kemp: The downside to that is, it's harder to run paid traffic to it because you're running it on pure views. And so you have to measure things more robustly on the back end, and and attribution will always be imperfect right? And that's why running a customer funnel that generates cash flow mitigates a lot of that, because you can just run traffic to the page and be less concerned about how many leads and how many how many actual clients are coming out of the specific video because it's harder to measure unless you went. You went super granular, and you have multiple versions of it from different platforms, etc. Jarred Brown: the option for Vsl, if I'm thinking about how you frame up a Vsl, is it? Maybe me condensing the book and going through the book, or me doing a a a basic overview of my my main mechanisms, and why they're important and and how they, is that, how how do you create a basel? is what is what I'm saying and what do you put in there. James Kemp: Oh! How do you present. Jarred Brown: I present through video. I've got the book there at the minute. But I think a a video. My audience seems to consume video. James Kemp: How do you? What's native to you ? How do you run trainings? How do you turn up? How do you show up. Jarred Brown: Yeah, video and zoom what you've got there. James Kemp: So do you use documents? Do you use. Jarred Brown: Yeah, I use. I use slides and ipad, and draw on the ipad and use the ipad to draw and examples. And then, say, if it's a Rugby League player, put down on the field where they are and give them practical examples of things

. Jarred Brown: Yeah, video and zoom what you've got there. James Kemp: So do you use documents? Do you use. Jarred Brown: Yeah, I use. I use slides and ipad, and draw on the ipad and use the ipad to draw and examples. And then, say, if it's a Rugby League player, put down on the field where they are and give them practical examples of things. So I typically to use my ipad and draw and discuss breakdown models. James Kemp: Okay. yeah. So do exactly that. So break down 3 key mechanisms, show show who they've worked for and then have a call to action at the end. Jarred Brown: Okay, cool. Okay? And you're just. James Kemp: When I say it doesn't matter. Everybody here is not running thousands of or hundreds of $1,000 of traffic to these things every day the driver is going to be the headline. Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: And you being comfortable, presenting. Jarred Brown: Yeah, I'm happy with them. yeah, it's just another. It's a another version, yeah of the of the boardroom that can sit within my profiles. And I'm comfortable testing initially without the I'm running it naked as well, and just having that call action straight to having a chat. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah. julie williams: We can. James Kemp: The social. The social world these days, I think, is conducive to that. But the caveat is that it's just harder to run paid traffic to if you want to. because it's harder to measure. Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah, cool. And also. To your message on Keen. If you can send me that link after. And then will we be going a little bit more deeper, and personalizing this a little bit more obviously in person. James Kemp: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's good. Jarred Brown: Perfect. James Kemp: The fun place to do it, especially eating pasta. Jarred Brown: Thanks, mate. James Kemp: Cool.

## Q&A: Funnel Implementation & Testing julie williams: Hi, Jack, can I jump in here? Yeah, thanks. Yeah. I'm about to listen. I'm just wondering. The back end of all this that you're doing is that in go high level under workflows. James Kemp: The the funnel templates are there, but they're all high level pages. They're all. julie williams: Yeah, because I'm working with upwork at the moment on getting out a nurture or a workflow in go high level. So we've got similar to. One offer is to book a call. No one ever books a call, and they don't know you. So from there it then jumps to. I've got a 12 page. Report that outlines what I do with a call to action on the end of that. If they don't, if they take that 12 page report. They still don't do anything. It flips then to the next section of A. My ultimate initial offering is to book in for a 6 week fast track of my bigger 16 week mastermind program. So that's ultimately where I want them to end up. And then I've got a what else have I got? I've got something else in there, if they don't do that. So we're just trying to work them through to take up some offer in that process in go high level, and it's about to be launched into some people I've mined in Linkedin. But I'm just wondering with this. DM. 2 that you do it? Is it? Is that what you called it? Hang on a minute. Yeah. Number 2. Cause I did your 3 K code way back. What is the difference between a nurture campaign or a workflow and your new? This new thing? Can you make it a bit clearer for me? So I don't really understand it. What the difference is, and am I on the right track? Do. James Kemp: I'm not here. I'm not here to, educate you on that distinction. If you if you're in motion with something, then it will be a mistake to switch it without testing it. So if you've got that funnel ready to go, put a hundred people through it. julie williams: But a hundred only I've got about 1,500 at the moment we've accumulated, but I haven't done anything with them at this point, so I'm just a bit unsure. What's gonna happen there? But why, only a hundred. James Kemp: Just to get some confidence. What happens when a hundred people go through? Yeah, often reflects what happens when a thousand people go through. julie williams: Right. So he's saying. James Kemp: Then what your level of commitment and investment to it., if a hundred people go through and do nothing, you need to change something. 100 people go through and do something. . 5 of them do something. Then you put it in front of a thousand. James Kemp: Then what your level of commitment and investment to it., if a hundred people go through and do nothing, you need to change something. 100 people go through and do something. . 5 of them do something. Then you put it in front of a thousand. julie williams: Hmm, yeah, right? So continue on the path. I'm going with the workflow. Test it out. But then, how does this fit in here? James Kemp: It's. julie williams: This is more about Vsls. James Kemp: For you right now, Julie. you're you're doing something. This isn't about getting in. I should have. I should have said that caveat at the top

. julie williams: Hmm, yeah, right? So continue on the path. I'm going with the workflow. Test it out. But then, how does this fit in here? James Kemp: It's. julie williams: This is more about Vsls. James Kemp: For you right now, Julie. you're you're doing something. This isn't about getting in. I should have. I should have said that caveat at the top . if you've got something that's working and it's in motion, then put this in the toolbox for later. If you need to come back to it. If you don't have a funnel that's working, and you don't have anything that's on the table that's putting out there. Then this is for you. But when you've got something that's about to go live marketplace, that's all that matters. julie williams: Yeah. And the other thing I just wanna check is your Google, Doc. Is that taking a back, I know for you. It's not but for us, should I still? Because when I get people to sign up if they sign up for that. James Kemp: Julie, you've got something that you're about to launch, get get them on the phone right. julie williams: Yeah, that's easy to say, but they don't get on the phone. If they don't know you for you, it's easy. James Kemp: What's that got? What's what's that got statement? Got to do anything. julie williams: Your assumption. James Kemp: About people don't getting on the phone. If they don't know you. julie williams: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. James Kemp: Well, well. julie williams: It doesn't seem. James Kemp: Selling, right? julie williams: No, it's been proven in in I've been working with Karita, and that for years, and they've been saying it's easy to, because you have a follow up. You tell them a time you do the 5 min before the call. It just doesn't work. julie williams: No, it's been proven in in I've been working with Karita, and that for years, and they've been saying it's easy to, because you have a follow up. You tell them a time you do the 5 min before the call. It just doesn't work. James Kemp: Okay. julie williams: And so that's why this nurture. If they don't do the call, then we send them to somewhere else in the back end in the go, high level, nurture, workflow sequence. James Kemp: Test it. julie williams: Test it alright. Well, I think I've got a call with you next week, so I might pick your brain a bit more. Then what would be. James Kemp: Bring me, bring me some data. julie williams:, what? Yeah, well, we're not really. James Kemp: How many people have! How many people have seen the report! How many people have booked a call. julie williams: Yeah, okay, yep, we're not ready to roll with it yet, because sorry, James, we're not ready to roll just yet. I reckon it'll be in the next 2 weeks. So I might even cancel that call with you next week and rebook it, for when I think it's we're gonna have some. James Kemp: Data bring me? Got it? Okay? Otherwise, we're sitting in a yeah critical hellscape of what might work could work and preconceived assumptions. julie williams: Yeah. Right. No worries. Thanks. James.

## Q&A: Info Products vs. Service Offers James Kemp: Anyone got products. They want to launch and wants to talk through it. or a low ticket, and what might work. What have you got in the toolkit? James Kemp: No, hey, George. George Fourie: How you doing good. Good, hey, man? George Fourie: Just something that you brought up. George Fourie: and I just want a distinction on it. You you mentioned in your funnel. George Fourie: you're going from info to info. And so George Fourie: that obviously helps with the with the congruence of the of the conversion. George Fourie: What about if it's George Fourie: the front end is info. But it's the community, or, my office, my partners, group or something, is, is a bit more, I guess. Service orientated in a way. George Fourie: Does that still flow in congruence. James Kemp: If the service is complementary to the last purchase. George Fourie: Right. James Kemp: Right. George Fourie: Yeah, okay, cool. So so I guess it's it's it doesn't really matter. Then, right?, if the if the content is George Fourie: if the service is what the content does. James Kemp: Yes, info info can be a misnomer. But if you're driving people through James Kemp: the purchase form, what is the next? Logical purchase James Kemp: is the thing that's complementary to the last one. George Fourie: Yes. James Kemp: So Justin and Sarah just ran a workshop, right?, about a particular Google Strategy. James Kemp: And so they had a hundred 70 people, or whatever it was, by the workshop. James Kemp: Then the upsell and the path of buying the workshop. James Kemp: They're done for you James Kemp: install with their with their supplier the done for you version of the you're coming to this workshop to learn about this. James Kemp: Do you want it done for you? That's before the workshop as well. George Fourie: Gotcha. James Kemp: And so the service is complementary to the last purchase. James Kemp: Do you want this done for you as a as a very complimentary. Next thing James Kemp: you're thinking about the sequence that they're going in the sequence of purchasing to make that natural. James Kemp: And as you go high ticket, you just want to expose some offers that then you can come back to and offer them later, because they might not sell on the 1st run through. George Fourie: Cool, so so on that I'm curious. How are you finding? So you've got all these $9 offers George Fourie: running? How are you finding that community upsell that that you included in that in the funnel. George Fourie: to the, your community level? And do you do you just do to community level? Or do you do George Fourie: $9 to sovereign, to the syndicate as well. James Kemp: I I would. I'm doing that manually if someone's joining the community, I'm starting to reach out to them to. Understand that. But my focus was getting the James Kemp: the front end working, if you, getting people to purchase memberships and then James Kemp: upselling, and then retention in that order. George Fourie: Gotcha, and in just last lost on that, are you seeing? George Fourie: So you got $9 offer? Go straight, for George Fourie: I think I saw it this way. Just correct me. So you got $9 offer. Go straight for 50 bucks a week, or that annual upsell 9 90. I think it was

. George Fourie: Gotcha, and in just last lost on that, are you seeing? George Fourie: So you got $9 offer? Go straight, for George Fourie: I think I saw it this way. Just correct me. So you got $9 offer. Go straight for 50 bucks a week, or that annual upsell 9 90. I think it was. And then on the training you downselled with a George Fourie: 9 for 9 or something that, yeah. So the. James Kemp: The annual works, but it only works to people who know me. George Fourie: Yeah. James Kemp: And so it's deceptive because it works to warm traffic. James Kemp: So then the funnel looks it's working. But then that doesn't scale. James Kemp: So the $50. James Kemp: The $50 a week works to code traffic. James Kemp: If they don't buy that, then by the time they get to the the training. They're offered the 9, the $9 trial. James Kemp: $9 for 9 days. George Fourie: Gotcha! George Fourie: Alright cool. George Fourie: cool. George Fourie: Thanks for that. James Kemp: So it's in totality. It's a $9 front end, a $29 bump. James Kemp: a $99 upsell a membership offer. James Kemp: and then a membership trial as a downsell. James Kemp: It's the sequence. George Fourie: Gotcha got it. James Kemp: And once all those things are working in harmony. Then you're getting. James Kemp: a decent amount amount of members, and they just want to retain them. George Fourie: it. Awesome. Thank you.

## Q&A: Low-Ticket Offer Performance & Ad Strategy James Kemp: Adam, did you have something. Adam Franklin: I did. I've got a lot of things going through my head. James. I guess you might have covered, and I did come late, so I'll watch the recording. Are you finding that there's certain offers that perform best for that initial Adam Franklin: advert that you're running in that $9 type of product Adam Franklin:, is it training, or is it a Adam Franklin: a Gpt or a tool that can get them going faster. James Kemp: Yep. So 3 basic categories is a template or something someone can use immediately. James Kemp: They work under 10 bucks, impulse, purchase bundles of templates or trainings work James Kemp: up to 30 bucks James Kemp: and then live workshops work particularly well because they're time-based. James Kemp:, so they've got and built scarcity. And they work, from 25 to a hundred. James Kemp: Live workshops are just tougher on James Kemp: to launch and deploy on an ad basis, because if you go too far out, then you're running ads too early and you're wasting ad spend. James Kemp: But if you try and wait too close. Then you don't get James Kemp: the velocity, and your your ads can just get stuck James Kemp: and don't get distribution, so that there are. They work extremely well. That is tough James Kemp: to do on a on to use on ads. So they work they work better as a James Kemp: as maybe a regular thing. If you had the the same thing running, every week, or every fortnight or every month. Adam Franklin: Got it and is, is setting up the ads and the time, because I've often been a bit scared of ads, and it can often take a lot of money and a lot of time to get them dialed in right. Do you find that there's a big, expensive learning curve, or is it quite straightforward now, with Adam Franklin: with with adverts. James Kemp: Mean, the wrong offer will always be expensive. Adam Franklin: Sure. James Kemp: So the adds, a James Kemp: ads are as challenging as they ever have been. I think the the biggest advantages we have now is James Kemp: we can test and deploy an Mvp. Of a landing page or something really quickly. So I will start with a minimum viable landing page where it's a headline. James Kemp: It's bullet points. It's a buy button. James Kemp: and that's it. If you get some purchases, then you start adding everything else to it James Kemp: but that the template that I've given you is the James Kemp: the one that you can deploy quickly. James Kemp: because it's just got all the components a guarantee proof faqs. James Kemp: etc, etc, headline sub headline, the ads. James Kemp: They need a little bit of luck as well. James Kemp: and, when we 1st launched, when we relaunched the book. James Kemp: It was, why isn't this working? Because this has worked really well. James Kemp: and it took a few weeks of putting ads up, taking them down trying audiences, and then it just it took off. James Kemp: And so what you find is that you can. James Kemp: It's healthy to. It's healthy to follow urine. I'm, I know, the book works and things haven't magically changed. So we're gonna we're just gonna put it on the shelf for a bit and then come back to it. James Kemp: And then, when the algorithm, gives you the gift James Kemp: and it works in the 1st few days, then it keeps going, and then you can feed it with creative
