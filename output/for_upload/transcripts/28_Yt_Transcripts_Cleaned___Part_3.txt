# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 3

be to do this and you could do this through low ticket products you could do it through AI tools you could do it through workshops you can do it through any experience where someone interacts with you these days I'd be much more mindful to sell a Consulting call than I would to book a free sales call I think it's far more targeted and valuable valuable for someone I think it's far more insightful and experiential for someone and you're far more likely to get a great long term client out of that than you are of just trying to convince someone on a 30 to 45 minute call so none of these none of these things are very new but the tools that our disposal to do something about it are sitting right to front of us and so the the future of marketing isn't marketing it's giving people the experience it's giving them a trial it's giving them a taste of what it might be to work with you and if you're in the information expertise business you have the advantage of a very very lowc costed delivery so you can do things and make them make make sense on an economic basis that people with physical and hard Goods simply can't do so that's where we are in the marketplace that's what I'm doing about it that's what a lot of my clients are doing about it and it's also what's working right now Interview with Dan Bolton: took me 7 months to get my first 100K month which is a huge pain do you think it's easier or harder to get to 100K month now I think the opportunity is never been better for someone with skills James Camp the Savant the Jack barley consultant talk to me about kind of how tone plays into standing out online your online content and your personality they're the same thing right my online content and my personality they're pretty much the same thing because I know you I can finally see you as humans we're desperate to connect with people and we're desperate to truly see and not be deceived when you truly just turn up in the way that you want to turn up as that comes through all these different channels and if you turn up as yourself then you can't be competed with but I have chickens and you don't that makes us different people we're back with another highly Topic demanded treat we have James Camp the Sant the Jack barley consultant and we're going to be diving into how how do get to 100K a month so whether you're making 5 10 20 50 and you want to get to that mythical seven figures we're going to talk about how we have done it how we would do it differently and we're going to break down the offers and the business model we're going to talk about funnels we're going to talk about team and all the mistakes that hopefully we've made that you can avoid so welcome back bro it's great to have you here we got some good feedback on our first one and we we've upped the anti of the production for this one oh just a little bit I know yeah just a little bit but one of the things I want to talk about was well I guess the main thing is getting to seven figures right clickfunnels is indoctrinated as all right two comic only one funnel away right one funnel away and so what I want to talk about is I guess firstly how How we did it we did it I think it would be helpful to talk about what what did we do to get there without going into the full back story if anyone wants the full back story they can click the link below there'll be the origin story going from selling was it cars was that the background yeah all of that lots of stuff so just quick recap what year did you get into actual online Consulting and then when was your first 100K month so 11 years ago damn dog I know I know you you were in your 20s then I was in my nappies so 11 years ago sold my first online program yeah and then it took

anyone wants the full back story they can click the link below there'll be the origin story going from selling was it cars was that the background yeah all of that lots of stuff so just quick recap what year did you get into actual online Consulting and then when was your first 100K month so 11 years ago damn dog I know I know you you were in your 20s then I was in my nappies so 11 years ago sold my first online program yeah and then it took me 7 months to get my first 100K month after I went from inperson Consulting to going online okay that's a sexy headline so what were you selling how much was it and how were you getting those clients yeah I had a program called e-commerce engine so back then e commer was pretty damn new and cobbling together all the different how do you optimize your shopping cart how do you optimize the the the page how do you do Facebook ads and those things were were pretty pretty complicated and so e-commerce engine was was only the beginning of when ads were ads were a thing and Google was the the main channel so e-commerce engine was started at 2 and a half Grand so they join you get a group a call and what else just a it was a Google drive folder with loads of how-to stuff in it so a course yeah and then it went to 4 and a half K and then it went to 60800 I think 65 68 don't remember precisely but it was pay once sell on the phone lifetime access yeah lifetime access group grew and grew and grew ran a call every week y keept selling so you got a course you got course modules you've got a Facebook group and you've got a community call once a week yeah go to webinar account on the the classic Sam ovens model but was just pre just Sam Sam was the one gave me the the seed idea of taking the stuff on I was going I was doing offline going online yeah but then later on when I worked with him it was it's too cheap you need to put the price up right yeah well I think it's important to note same with me I hit my first 100K month First 100k month not 11 years ago in 7 months it took me first iteration of my business was everything for everyone I was around 10 to 20K a month for a year relaunched the agency went from everything to everyone to just working with coach and Consultants getting more sales calls with webinars went from Z to 100K month with that a 9 months so you had me beat by two but I think it's important for people to know that we didn't just hit that and then stay there and everything was nice and dandy way and so can we quickly go on the Peaks and troughs of that because I know that you've had different business model changes it's not you've been selling the course model and things that for the years so you go to 100K a month did you sustain it how long did you st it for what did that look yeah so the next iteration was people said How are you selling expensive things on the telephone I want to learn about how to do that so I had a program called Authority architecture so I took the same model and lifted it across to a much more lead gen B2B I was just repackaging what I'd used to sell e-commerce engine into a front- end course and that was 6800 and then I sold on the phone course group calls the difference with that was the I had I started to to have a back end so I started to okay you've been around for a while you've hit your goals you're getting leads coming in I've got a mastermind do you want to join and that was called Authority Elite so I I I then graduated from the pain of starting every month at zero right which is a huge pain yeah crime a river pain as people at 100 Grand well so just

then I sold on the phone course group calls the difference with that was the I had I started to to have a back end so I started to okay you've been around for a while you've hit your goals you're getting leads coming in I've got a mastermind do you want to join and that was called Authority Elite so I I I then graduated from the pain of starting every month at zero right which is a huge pain yeah crime a river pain as people at 100 Grand well so just a quick recap so going back to the price points you had 100K a month I imagine that was you selling 30 or 40 units of your yeah it was rents and repeat and repair just keep going around starting with zero recurring Revenue got to keep going oh you had pay plans but at the prices I was at most people just paid up yeah that's the recurring Revenue yeah the recurring Revenue lasted for a month yeah yeah yeah totally get it yeah yeah so that then I was started to be sold and indoctrinated on the idea and experienced it of getting some element of recurring Revenue so then I went Authority Elite and that's when I hit my first I did 256k I remember exactly because I remember it happening when I was I'm selling a front end and then I've got a back end which at 50% of the revenue I coming to rec caring 2K a month do you think because obviously Cost to acquire a client we've had so many iterations and Evolutions to the online space just to give us some perspective for anyone who knows the Facebook ads world what was it costing you to get a call booked to and then to acquire a client what was that cost so and when I started e-commerce engine it cost about 100 bucks to get a client disgusting New Zealand Dollars oh my gosh so we're working pay which is $4 us time hard question completely subjective do you think it's easier or harder to get to 100K a month now than it was then I don't just mean cost to acquire customer all the thing and and I think it's important to qualify even though you were 7 months into yeah this business it wasn't your first rodeo you bu you built skills there was no way as a noob as a beginner I was doing I was doing 40 to 50 Grand a month Consulting perfect in person that's 100% what I want there was a skill transfer yeah so online is a Leverage is a leverage piece not and and I think people often mistake it for the distribution so I'll answer the question but I think people mistake it for the internet has given us access to more people but I think it's just given us a bigger power l in terms of the delivery of those things because it showed when I could do Consulting one to one but the leverage I got from going one to many in a group envirment was ridiculous because I to get the 50 Grand a month they had to do 20 30 40 hours a week of Consulting right and I could do the same delivery in 3 hours M so I think it's easier now to grow faster but I think less people are able to do it because the barriers to entry are much lower right so I think you can I think the opportunity has never been better for someone with skills to transfer those on online and grow quickly but I think for most people they don't have the skills that are transferable to achieve a six figure month out of the gate yeah and I think there's there's a really easy way to understand this when I first got Sam Market sophistication oven or really any ads showing up in my news feed let's say 5 years ago or six years ago before I'd stepped into the space Sam's messaging was not all the advanced stuff that we know now in terms of unique mechanisms and things that he was I will show you how to get clients online and that was such mindblowing such a mind-blowing claim because no one could make it

think there's there's a really easy way to understand this when I first got Sam Market sophistication oven or really any ads showing up in my news feed let's say 5 years ago or six years ago before I'd stepped into the space Sam's messaging was not all the advanced stuff that we know now in terms of unique mechanisms and things that he was I will show you how to get clients online and that was such mindblowing such a mind-blowing claim because no one could make it and so I could almost recite his his his vsl headline was how to get 20 to 30 clients a month online with predictability yeah yeah yeah it was down to the dollar in the day down to the dollar in the day yeah and so so heavy breakthrough advertising yeah so it talks about the different levels of Market sophistication so if you invented if you if you figured out how to teach weight loss yeah the claim is I will help you lose weight and then other people come up with that same claim and so then you go I will help you lose £10 in 30 days and then it goes a level deeper in your added mechanism I will help you lose 10 to 30 days using anabolic fasting whatever it might be and that's what the market we've been in has gone through and so why it's harder because the barrier entry is lower is there's so many coaches and Consultants that can come online and say I can help you get to 10K a month I can help you lose 30 the differentiator is obviously you as the human being right it's you as the NCH it's your messaging and all of those things and that's where the complexity comes to right is it's not the the way that you get to 100K month has gotten wildly more challenging because you've got to have 37 offers and run Tik Tok ads and dance on reals and all those things the Simplicity is the same from my perspective but the difficulty is in the ability to stand out and convert strangers andan customers if you're playing in the red ocean with everyone else yeah fully and I think Market sophistication as well of people think about if you if you look at coaching and cons Consulting we've gone through the early adopter phase so the people who were the early adopters who were going to be coached and consult they were the easy sales right and now we're in the mass and we're we're going towards the the middle of the of the curve there are more opportunities because more people of different sophistication levels and businesses are coming into the market but they are harder to sell because there's more aggregate supply in the market for those so there's more opportunity but there's also more supply of people who will fulfill that opportunity yeah it's Online education interesting because when I got started 5 years ago it was really weird when I talked to everyday people that I was surrounded by and I said I bought an online course and it's teaching me how to start a business online it was not even a question of scam it was didn't even registering people's minds that online education was a real thing and now I think with the introduction of you've got got even even just think about how something this I can't remember the exact number but bin Shapiro and he's got the daily wire don't call me on the numbers but it's something he has a million subscribers a month and they pay tens of dollars whatever that might be the idea that you can find your favorite content creator or find their business Guru or sign up to masterclass

.com this is all commonplace now yeah so the average person is being able to access education or content behind a pay wall they never have before so people get it yeah right when you're paying $5 a month or $97 a month or $1,000 for content that you can't get anywhere else that's a common experience now whereas 5 years ago that truly wasn't you had to be an early adopter to get it so there are more people that you said have the have the awareness that this exists and then on the flip side I don't know what the numbers would be but it's felt at least the industry is 10x in terms of if we were through it and I want to qualify by we're not say this is the way obvious we're passionate about what we teach or it's the only way yeah you know we were talking about someone before who just got 3,000 clients 3,000 students paying them $5 a month yeah I mean that's insane so there's a lot of ways to get to 10K just there are a lot of ways to get to 100K but if you're just starting out let's talk about models and offers yeah could I just say something about the speed thing yeah please because the speed is relative to the position of the the number of steps they need to take to get to get to the outcome goal so for example if you have the skills then there's one step past that is packaging the skills so other another person can benefit from those skills then there's the packaging of that and the ability to sell those skills to people on mass and then those people to act on the skills and then so it's Steps but if you're a oneon-one coach or consultant and you're already working with clients you don't you've you've got you get results but you haven't packaged it correctly there's only one step which is just packaging it correctly yeah so those people are further down the steps towards the 100K than the people who had just got the skills or in many cases don't have the skills because they need to get the skill get get get results with the skill package the skill so there's all those steps so the speed is just relative to the number of steps they need to take that's why if someone comes to me and goes I've got a Consulting practice and I'm doing 20 to 40K a month and it's lumpy and it's oneon-one and burnt out I'm sweet this is pretty straightforward because it's just a packaging exercise and putting it off around it whereas someone's I've got all these skills I'm not sure which one to focus on I get results over here but I don't get you that there's some filters to go through before they're going to take those steps cuz they're five steps away whereas the person who's delivering even one to one or with low Leverage is only really one step away and that's a packaging step we can look back to this but I want to mention this as well there's a huge difference between someone who's been at Teachability $10,000 a month for 3 months and $10,000 a month for two years in terms of their teachability as well so one of the biggest challenges 100% so I was I had a client U asking me a few weeks ago who's in the multiple seven figures profit level and he got there really fast cuz he had a really decent sized audience and he was asking me what are the biggest things that you find in terms of taking something from 10 month to six figures s figures and I said well you need to understand that not all six figures are created equal if you are I have an amazing client called Grayson who's 20 and he went from 10K a month to $87,000 cash in four months our first 16 weeks working together it's because everything I told him to do he did yeah he knew what he didn't know and he

me what are the biggest things that you find in terms of taking something from 10 month to six figures s figures and I said well you need to understand that not all six figures are created equal if you are I have an amazing client called Grayson who's 20 and he went from 10K a month to $87,000 cash in four months our first 16 weeks working together it's because everything I told him to do he did yeah he knew what he didn't know and he was fully teachable and so that's a really interesting variable is that it's skills but it's also your ability to be teachable and coachable and not overthink things because if you've been in the game for a while you might not have made a ton of money but you have more confidence than maybe you should in areas where you shouldn't have confidence this is really this is really relevant to me because someone who's joined me this week is making great Revenue making great money and he he was describing himself as a newbie in our convers in our chat conversation and I'm I it didn't click straight away but what he was talking about was that he is saying I'm a newbie because I am I don't know what I don't know right and I'm coming in with a clean slate here and I'm going to listen to this this is my goal I've got all these skills I'm already making lots of money and those things but I want a new model so in his mind he's coming in with a newb and that's the that's the teachable person right that is a coachable person because they're listen nothing's off the table here I've got a goal I want to do it a certain way I know you can help me but I'm a blank slate I've got a beginner's mind and I was oh okay I this well and this is the meta skill of learning right if I have a superar yeah yeah Meta skill of learning if I have a superpow it's that I can learn really fast because I know what I'm not good at I got really brutal feedback from a mentor a few months ago and I was so grateful for it cuz I was man if he didn't give me that feedback I wouldn't have this opportunity to learn but I realized that that's a skill that I've cultivated of going well if my goal is here and I'm here there's a whole lot of stuff I don't know that I need to learn and get better at and evolve into that I think a lot of people struggle with and so yes it's skill acquisition but if we it we could people that have levels of open to learning and we could lay out the plan and some people succeed and some people wouldn't and it's not down to the strength of the plan it's down to the ability to embrace that and learn and be teachable and coachable to apply it cuz if you try and put your spin on every s every single thing I'm unique snowflake right I'm going to try and and I I love and hate this word alignment right I'm going to find that the model that's aligned to me and I'm I believe that but when you're getting your first five clients you're not trying trying to get the five perfect the right to think yet yeah well I was listening to Grant and hosi it was a old interview that for whatever reason hosi pulled off his channel but it was still exists on the internet somewhere and Grant was saying you can't go straight from broke to meaning you have to make money right you can't be trying to pay the bills and also trying to impact the world it doesn't work you have to so anyway all that it say things happen in sequence so if we're talking about the foundational things and let's talk about someone's first offer yeah because either they're at 10K a month and they only have one offer and it sucks and it's not scalable or it's not attractive or you're at
