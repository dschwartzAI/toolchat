# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 15

. So inside our world, we do and build those things. Inside our workshops, we give more context to those things. How do you create a hybrid offer? So we show, we have a look behind the curtain. In the content that I create, I will be speaking about the mechanisms over and over again. I will be talking about the hybrid offer over and over again, and inserting it into one of my content types. I'll be talking about customers to clients, creating customers, turning them into clients, multiple times, because it's a mechanism that is effective and we use it. And I'll be talking about the daily client machine multiple times. So by just inserting those mechanisms into my content, I'm creating context within the content that I create. So if I go to Facebook right now, and I search the word "hybrid," and I look for posts from me, and I search the word "hybrid," you will see how consistently I have created context around that word, the hybrid offer. I've created it so much that everyone in the world has stolen the idea from me. I partly jest, but the nature of inserting the mechanism over and over again means that I'm generating context about that mechanism all the time. My consistency is not only in the creation of the content, but it's also on the insertion of the mechanism. ## Mechanisms, Identity, and Market Differentiation **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of unique mechanisms and a clear identity as key differentiators in a commoditized market. He explains that mechanisms are the unique ways problems are solved and should be consistently highlighted in content. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** And, I've been shouting from the rooftops recently about competition and comparison, and what's left for people to compete on. The only thing left for you to compete on is your unique mechanisms and the ideas that you bring to the market. Everything else is commoditized. Every single other thing can be copied and replicated. But your mechanisms and your orientation towards those mechanisms, the mechanism being the way that you get results, is the thing that you can consistently do that. So we can do this after, in the workshop portion. But if we create context around our mechanisms and we insert those repeatedly, and then we have an aspirational identity – you don't even need to be that good at content and that good at communication, you just need to be consistent with the messaging – mechanisms come down to the unique way you solve problems and a clarity over who those problems are solved for, or the desires they have. ## Content Creation Superstructure and Resources **Summary:** James Kemp reiterates the importance of context in content and directs his audience to additional resources on mechanisms, identity, and authority within his membership and syndicate programs. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** So after we've thought about what context we want to deliver, what mechanisms we have that we want to insert into the content, by the way, if you're in the membership of the syndicate, more on mechanisms and identity and creation and authority in the classroom. So I've linked directly to that. So once we've inserted the context piece, we need to have the actual content., what do we say and what do we write about? ## The Power Laws of Content and Four Content Buckets **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the power laws of content, stating that a small percentage of content drives the majority of results. He then outlines four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problem, and plan – as tools for effective content creation. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** The power laws in content are the power laws in anything else. 95% of the results from social and from content are driven by less than 5% of your content

. He then outlines four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problem, and plan – as tools for effective content creation. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** The power laws in content are the power laws in anything else. 95% of the results from social and from content are driven by less than 5% of your content. I could point at a few dozen posts that have done more for brand and sales and audience and trust and those things than 250 other things that I've posted. So there are four simple buckets of content that can be created regularly: philosophy, proof, problem, and plan. And I want to give you these tools so you can take the tools, assemble them, and then break them apart and reassemble them because it's too simplistic to say that there's this, there's one equation that you just write about philosophy, you just write about problem, you just write a plan. The reality is that in the content, all these ideas are blended together. ## Philosophy Content: Sharing Personal Beliefs **Summary:** James Kemp defines philosophy content as sharing personal beliefs and worldview. He emphasizes the importance of authenticity and vulnerability in this type of content, suggesting it builds trust in a low-trust market. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** So I've got to give you examples, otherwise this is much less useful. So philosophy is what you personally believe to be true. And in the marketplace, in a low-trust marketplace, people are buying who someone is and what they believe in greater numbers than they're buying what they do, because what they do is largely commoditized. So what do you personally believe to be true? What do you believe? What do you observe? What trends are you seeing? What taste do you have? And how do you think differently about common ideas? What are the things hiding in plain sight? And what do that is hidden to others? And often your philosophy, in terms of the vulnerability part, has a useful requirement to say things that other people won't say. in this piece of content, I'm saying that if you don't do the thing that you tell other people to do, then you have a lack of congruency with what you want people to do. If you're a coach and you don't invest in coaching, there's a small lack of congruency there. If you're a fat personal trainer, you get less clients. All of these ideas are, people are observing., my philosophy is, I do what I teach and teach what I do. I've done the things that I talk about, and I do the things that I tell other people to do, and then I demonstrate them along the way. So the philosophy is, do what you say you're going to do and be who you say you are, and demonstrate that along the way. It's much more powerful than telling people the opposite thing. But in that case, I'm calling out an idea, being maybe mildly offensive to some people, but demonstrating in real time what I believe. And again, vulnerability is required. When I talk about my personal life and those things, they're through the lens of an insight and a story. And sometimes vulnerably, they're through the lens of me being me, seeing something that frustrates me and triggers me because it's something that I tolerated or compromised on in the past. So sometimes I get annoyed because I see a past version of myself and realize that it doesn't have to be that. So I will create content that attempts to tell that story. So philosophy is you. What do you believe, and what is your worldview? To a lesser or greater extent, all of my clients share some or all of my worldview about my ideas about sovereignty and freedom and these pieces. So I share those on a regular basis because being my people is an important part of being in my world

. So I will create content that attempts to tell that story. So philosophy is you. What do you believe, and what is your worldview? To a lesser or greater extent, all of my clients share some or all of my worldview about my ideas about sovereignty and freedom and these pieces. So I share those on a regular basis because being my people is an important part of being in my world. It's very useful to believe those things. If people want to build a gigantic business with a glass building with a name on it, then I'm probably not the right guy to talk to. And so I need to be clear in my content that this is what I believe, and this is what I stand for, and this is also what I don't believe in as well. ## Proof Content: Demonstrating How Results are Achieved **Summary:** James Kemp defines proof content as going beyond testimonials by providing insights into how clients achieved results. He stresses the importance of highlighting the mechanisms used to achieve success, making the process replicable for potential clients. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** The second type is proof, and proof is different to, say, a case study or a testimonial. It's different to a testimonial, but it's definitely my take on a case study. Proof is proving you can help someone by demonstrating how you help someone. And solid proof goes beyond testimonials. It delivers insight on how someone you worked with got a result, and mechanisms are very, very useful when you're talking about proof. So this post here, talking about how Tom made 19k in sales helping people finish their music. He joined the syndicate, so I'm inserting the product name, the thing he participated in. And then I'm talking about the mechanisms that are used to generate that 19k. Again, an example many years ago from Matt, the eight steps that he took to transform his business with a case study. I'm not saying just what the results were. I am telling people the mechanisms these people used to get the results. And that's the distinction between a typical case study. Most case studies aim to boost the credibility of the person narrating the story. I'm seeking to generate an insight to show that there's things that are accessible for people to get a result, that if you use a hybrid offer, if you use customers to clients, if you use the daily client machine, etc., that you can get a result behind them. So there's that. I dig deeper into more of those examples, and the actual breakdown of those and the ultimate case study template, which is again in the classroom. But, at a very simple level, these are one step beyond a case study. They're not saying just what happened, they're demonstrating how it happened as well. ## Problem Content: Sharing Insights and Solutions **Summary:** James Kemp defines problem content as sharing insights gathered from experience, offering solutions to common problems. He advocates for providing complete solutions within the content, demonstrating expertise and building trust. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** Problem. So this is, share an insight that you gather from delivering. The more common the problem, and the more unique your approach to solving it, the more traction these posts get. This is where a belief in giving everybody everything they need in your content is useful. I don't hold back when I tell stories that I create. I don't say,

- ```txt ## Pricing for Mentorship **Summary:** James Kemp discusses his pricing strategy for his mentorship program, the Syndicate, explaining how he arrived at the sweet spot of $300 per week and how this pricing allows for flexibility and optimal results for his clients. Video Source:* Million Dollar Mentor.txt **Content:** The pricing sensitivity of the Syndicate was pretty high. When I started, it was $250 a week, and I slowly raised it over 19 months to $500. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, including considering who I enjoyed working with and their energy levels, I found the sweet spot is about $300 a week. People paying around that price stay the longest and get the best results. They also utilize the flexibility of the model, moving up to the Circle for more intensive coaching when needed, and then returning to the Syndicate when less access is sufficient. Going forward, I'm leading with a mentorship offer. Coaching will be limited to 24 people by invitation only. Most people I coach will come through the mentorship offer, understand the distinction, and then decide if they want more access. ## The Power of Demonstrating in Mentorship **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the shift from coaching to mentorship, highlighting the benefits of demonstrating and showing clients how to achieve results, rather than solely coaching them. Video Source:* Million Dollar Mentor.txt **Content:** This is the frame of the offer: our goal is building a 100k per month sovereign consulting business, 65 clients or less, and working under 3 days a week. I will *show* you exactly how I've done it, give you my tools, and help you implement them. The promise isn't "I will coach you," but "I will show you." Mentorship requires access, so we have calls, but we're clear about what happens. In the Syndicate, you have office hours with me Tuesdays and Thursdays, plus monthly workshops where I show you what's working for me and help you implement it. I've removed the promise of bi-monthly workshops. Now I'll do them when it feels right and when the insights are flowing. This is a mentorship community. I show you what's working in real time and help you implement it. This is *not* coaching where I provide accountability, tracking, and motivation. It's on you to bring those, though there are options to get that from me to accelerate your results. ## Positioning Mentorship Against Coaching **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the market opportunity for mentorship, explaining how to position it as a superior alternative to coaching for a specific target audience. Video Source:* Million Dollar Mentor.txt **Content:** The market opportunity for positioning mentorship as better than coaching is significant. Many people have had poor experiences with online coaching—being handed off to assistants, lacking access, or experiencing a mismatch between promises and implementation. Positioning mentorship against coaching is an easy sell. Mentorship doesn't require the same level of investment as coaching, and it's often cheaper. Distinctions create contrast, and contrast draws attention. My messaging is targeted at those currently doing something called coaching or who are dissatisfied with their current model and time commitments. I also target those who have achieved significant things but are repulsed by the online coaching world. Both groups are looking for a new and better opportunity. ## Recurring Revenue as a Hindsight Metric **Summary:** James Kemp explains that recurring revenue is a metric observed in hindsight, emphasizing the importance of focusing on client momentum and dynamic offers to create a model that generates recurring revenue over time. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** Recurring revenue is a mirage. It only recurs in hindsight. Many in the coaching and consulting space believe they have recurring revenue businesses, but they have long-duration products on payment plans. This is a crucial distinction. The only real money is *now* money – cash in the bank

. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** Recurring revenue is a mirage. It only recurs in hindsight. Many in the coaching and consulting space believe they have recurring revenue businesses, but they have long-duration products on payment plans. This is a crucial distinction. The only real money is *now* money – cash in the bank. Upfront payments create a delivery liability. The 20k you accept for 12 months of work is a delivery obligation. Smart businesses balance assets and liabilities. Clients are assets, and we generate yield by delivering agreed value. To grow revenue, we grow the asset: increase clients, client value, or client lifetime. My definition of recurring revenue is revenue that showed up in the past. I'll show you revenue that has recurred. I'll take you into the future so you can build a model that generates recurring revenue when you look back. ## The Power of Weekly Pricing **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for weekly pricing over monthly, highlighting its benefits in terms of increased sales, higher annual revenue, client flexibility, and reduced churn. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** I've found weekly pricing superior to monthly. Objectively, it has a lower "now" number, increasing sales. It generates 8.5% more annually due to 13 four-week blocks in a year. Subjectively, it's more dynamic. Clients feel more flexibility with adding/removing products and payments. It's simpler to upsell, downsell, and minimize churn as investment decisions are more immediate. I cut churn by 80% when I implemented a community level at a lower price, as people downgraded rather than left completely. ## The Simple-Complex Stack for Recurring Revenue **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the simple-complex stack, a strategy for creating a series of offers that address the increasing complexity clients experience as they implement simple initial promises, ensuring continued client engagement and recurring revenue. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** If we make things simple for clients, our offer is simple to sell. But even simple processes are individually complex. I make it simple to create a $3,000 offer. The complexity comes in the execution. Some people sell immediately, others take months. We take people through a simple-complex axis. Simple: "I'll create a $3,000 offer with you." Complex: "How do I sell it?" Simple: "I'll create it for you (Fastlane)." Complex: "It's hard to make $3k/week consistently." Simple:

> "Join the Syndicate, I'll tell you exactly what to do."
 This chain is theoretically infinite. Over time, this axis can continually be sold to an individual client. Making your offer simple, while appreciating the client's experience of complexity, allows for a natural next offer. ## The Social Code: Delivering Insight **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of delivering insight on social media, differentiating it from readily available information and highlighting its value in attracting and engaging an audience. Video Source:* Social Code.txt **Content:** You must deliver insight because insight is extremely rare, and rare things are valuable. Information allows us to observe what is happening, but insights tell us *why*. If you can demonstrate why something is happening in someone's life, you demonstrate a deeper understanding that others seek. People are seeking a deeper understanding of why things happen to them. Insight starts to piece together why something’s happening through real experience. ## The Social Code: Selling Ideas **Summary:** James Kemp explains that social media is best used for selling ideas, not products, as this builds buy-in and makes selling products easier later on. Video Source:* Social Code.txt **Content:** Before someone can buy something, they need to buy *into* something – an idea. If you sell people on your ideas on social, it’s much easier to sell them on you and your products. The sequence is always idea first, then product. Approach social media as an idea salesperson. Don't make direct offers. It’s clunky and induces fatigue. Use social content to move people to social messaging or email. ## The Social Code: Plan Posts for Leadership **Summary:** James Kemp explains that plan posts, which outline a clear direction and strategy, are the most powerful type of social media content for establishing leadership and attracting a following. Video Source:* Social Code.txt **Content:** In a chaotic world, everyone wants a plan. To get followers, you need to lead. To establish leadership, decide on a direction, define it, and lead others towards it. This content blends philosophy, proof, and problem. Plans require courage. They work well as pillar content because they’re risky. Setting your stall out is the single biggest movement of attention you can make. This content can be repurposed and referred back to. On July 18th, I posted my plan to get back to $3 million a year. I detailed the steps, and people were curious and started following along. Eight weeks later, I updated them on my progress. These posts create a viral loop. Setting a plan is powerful for attracting a following and for self-accountability. It sets you on a journey. ## The Social Code: Moving from Public to Private **Summary:** James Kemp discusses strategies for moving people from public social media feeds to private messaging or email, where direct offers can be made more effectively. Video Source:* Social Code.txt **Content:** Attraction takes time. Direct asks move people to the next stage. Two-step posts get people to respond, then you send a DM. Examples: 
> "Recorded a loom on selling 60k hybrid offers with a Google Doc. Want the private link?"
 or 
> "Finally doing a workshop on my social media strategy. DM for the link."
 Be explicit – ask for comments, then DM. I've evolved this into "insight two-steps." They ask for a comment, but I treat them sales letters. Example: 
> "Three steps to selling high-ticket with a three-page doc. Since July, 90 people signed up, paying 10k-75k/year. I did it with a Google Doc. Promise: new money, expand LTV. Workshop:

[details]. DM for link."
 This is a sales page with insight. Sell up to the line, but make the sale via DM. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Prioritizing Life Over Business **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the Sovereign Consultant model, emphasizing the importance of building a life that a business feeds, rather than the other way around, and prioritizing intentional inputs and leverage. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The Sovereign Consultant model is about building a life that a business feeds. Most people want a good life, and the cash flow, impact, and meaning a business provides can feed that life. It's easy to stay at the surface level of strategy, but tactics and strategies alone are volatile and exhausting. Principles and philosophy guide strategy and lower volatility. My calendar demonstrates what's important to me: daily exercise, date night, family dinner, client group calls, and calls only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This creates space for creativity and flow. You don't earn the right to free space; you choose it. Intentional time management dictates results. The Sovereign way is about leverage and serving the maximum number of people. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Building a Brand **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a three-step process for building a strong brand: defining and selling a unique mechanism, crafting an aspirational identity, and building a world around your brand. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A brand is what people say about you when you're not there. The ideal brand does all the selling. Three components: world, identity, and mechanisms. Start with the mechanism – the way you get results. It needs to be unique (yours) and work. Examples: Daily Client Machine (lead magnet with a self-liquidating offer), Customers to Clients (low-ticket workshops with an offer), Hybrid Offer (selling via documents). Next, craft an aspirational identity. What does someone become when they commit to your world? JK's "Cash Creators" is a great example. Finally, world-building. People buy who you are more than what you do. World-building is an abstraction of your reality. Components: characters, language, places, storylines, memes. My world: The Brazilian, Mr. 13, Miss 7, the cat, the dog, Bali, my journey back to $3 million. Have fun with it (oat milk, Atomic Habits). ``` ============================================================
