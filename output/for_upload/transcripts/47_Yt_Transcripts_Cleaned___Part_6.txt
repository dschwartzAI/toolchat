# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 6

and I've had people going to have pay me multiple six figures y so it's I I believe two Dimensions we're selling two dimensions of time yeah what gets done in terms of what did you say the goal yeah the the dream and the goal the Dream and the goal so sell the goal and then the dream yep and then two dimensions of this is everything that you get there's plenty there but if you want to go if you want to go faster go on the fast lane then then you can you can be here so so with so everyone listening to this has probably a binary belief they're either trying to Hash it out one offer to 1 million yeah we know that works right that can totally work right then there are other people who have value ladders and offer stacks and they go from a $7 thing to a $97 a month thing to blah blah blah blah again totally subjective there's no right way but how would you think about it when you're thinking about we've got this core offer that we're helping people build out right 90 days 16 weeks weekly pricing dream outcome it's goal not dream I love how I'm confusing people with the language it's dream but goal but it's the the short-term time commitment with a believable podcast yeah yeah when should people consider just totally opinion on integrating a second offer the second offer might be completely different so if we think about on practical ends it's a different Community different curriculum yeah and or just bolting on something to their original offer when I say that maybe it's a community offer and then you've got one to one connected to that I believe so this is this is this is a comes back to it depends on how fast you want to go I believe someone should develop a 12mon road map out of the gate even if they don't stick to that for the client with a definitive way of where you're going to take them in the first 12 to 16 weeks so I believe that people should develop a 12-month Roat for the client just to give themselves some certainty and have something to sell into and you know and if you already have a front end offer where you're just serving someone for 8 to 16 weeks one of the easiest offers to make after that is do you want to stick around and keep getting support yeah well why the road map is The Road Map important because because the biggest objection I hear from clients that can't figure out how to keep clients is they we've done everything you're then create more things to do and more problems to solve each problem you solve creates another problem to solve so what you're saying is identify more problems and solutions than just what you intend to solve in the first 16 weeks so that reselling becomes easy that's the first piece then what's the second piece to that that it's Dynamic mhm that it it's not I think people think that they have to have a 12 month road map that is fixed and at the the the early you are in the beginning the more variables that you have to introduce you go they can do that three-month period and three weeks right but this threat but based on experience the the three weeks I gave them to do that thing that's takes them three months cuz it's complicated right so the road maps a dynamic and and you need to set you need to have a Dynamic approach to to where the clients are going but it's again it's a hypothesis this is the best guess about what clients needs to do in the next 12 months to to achieve the dream and and then sticking to that and then being Dynamic within it to to change the order and sequence if you need to yeah we're always responsive to clients right yeah we talk about what you're making for your guys and I'm making for my guys all the time it's I feel in my Waters that they need a bit more jumping on a community call being so I saw James km say this and I'm mother no kidding but it's is so funny with

next 12 months to to achieve the dream and and then sticking to that and then being Dynamic within it to to change the order and sequence if you need to yeah we're always responsive to clients right yeah we talk about what you're making for your guys and I'm making for my guys all the time it's I feel in my Waters that they need a bit more jumping on a community call being so I saw James km say this and I'm mother no kidding but it's is so funny with business models and stuff that so so how I did it this year so this year was a reset for both of us we could do 10 podcasts about the hilarious journey of our our stories and you were selling software 5 minutes ago and not even doing consulting what I did is I did one: one first yeah and then I capped out a one to one and I'm a huge fan of telling people to at least start with something CU it is easy to sell yeah much easier when you say I'm giving you my time I'm holding your hand we're in the trenches together much EAS easier to sell than saying here's a course login all the best right it's it's easier to sell now especially when people have gone through courses and programs where they didn't get results for yes and the straight out we came out of the gate saying a similar thing which is you've done the courses you've done the programs and all you want is someone to help you assemble the good stuff yes so so what I did is it was one to one and then I filled that up and The Hybrid Offer then I was I can either just get more Ono one clients which was not appealing I could either just charge more which was appealing in the sense that I didn't want to move those 30 clients through a price increase and all that stuff and so all I did was create a community version of that and the community visual that if we just get it visual here okay so how you and I teach this right I think you call it the hybrid offer I don't have a name for it but there's one to one and the one to one that I sold was there's no curriculum so you're just getting my time there was no I think we had a slack Channel and then I built out the community and the community was half the price no one to one with me one call a week and a now a school group right so let's just say it's 1500 a month for community and 3,000 a month for one: one what's really beautiful about this particular stack is the one: one does not have a CPR group it does not have C curriculum it doesn't have separate group calls they have all the same group calls so we've got content coaching and community and this and then all that's happening is some people pay more for time with us crazy and this is what I is again it's so subjective so many ways to make money so many ways to get to 100K a month but I would say is the best way yeah yeah but but I would say what I would do is you fill your cup with onetoone clients you get insanely good at what you do controversial right I know you get you really good at what you do you charge a premium for it because you're selling a time and then you can bolt on a community you can do it either or but what I would say is if you start with a community you're not getting the rips in when it comes to Fig the the feedback loop is too long if if you got someone 10 people in a community it's harder to know how many people are winning and what they're struggling with if the only checkpoints you have is this person comes to a community call every 3 weeks right there's no oneto one chicken so I really starting one to one and going to group but here's what I would say that's where I would cap out to go to 100K a month is that you don't then

Fig the the feedback loop is too long if if you got someone 10 people in a community it's harder to know how many people are winning and what they're struggling with if the only checkpoints you have is this person comes to a community call every 3 weeks right there's no oneto one chicken so I really starting one to one and going to group but here's what I would say that's where I would cap out to go to 100K a month is that you don't then need this and then this and then another thing I think to get to 100K a month it's you could do it with one offer I think the sexiest way that I is it's one offer it's one content one Community it's just that some people get one to one and some people do not and the price reflects that this is the simplest model that I've seen to get to 100K a month i' I'd love to know what do you think of that model cuz I know we have very similar models and then there's one one other we need a third person in the room to argue against this there there isn't a lot of contrari and stuff I'm G to come up with here but but I would really love to know where do things oneoff things come in right so so let's just say people are bought in on this they're going to have one to one and they're going to have Community but I know in your world you have paid days people pay for days there are events that you run there are paid workshops so obviously youve got these core things how do you think about these auxiliary things these periphery things where they're not the main offers you've not spending all of your time promoting this one thing cuz we're going to talk about funnels and getting clients shortly and how to fill these but but how do you think about those things because I think one of the things that people really struggle with is holding the attention of I had a client today that just made me lose my mind where he was oh yeah I've decided I'm running a retreat in January so I'm just going to pause all promotion for my offer until then just to fill the event I'm so you are anyway so that's a tension that people find themselves in is they it's juggling balls and spinning plates and because these ones aren't going very well then I launch another one and the these ones are suffering and this one so how do you think about those things I try and make these distinctions as best I can without having an iPad and sketching them out so I I see there's two classes of people that that I transact with in my business there's customers and a customer will buy a training and a workshop with a defined a defined input and those are customer products and I sell those for between 100 and 500 bucks right so they're customers they have transacted with me they get a training they'll get a workshop it's to find them what they get then I have clients clients I dedicate energy I dedicate thought care Etc to and clients are there and they're making a commitment to come into my world and I'm making a commitment to them clients can enter my world in a community for as low as 300 bucks and then they can buy you there's another level of do you want to go faster do you want more access that's the next level up but I also sell ad hoc hours that you can buy in bunches of four and 10 mhm and then you can buy days with me or I I run a retreat every 3 to four months at the moment y so what I found is that in that client stack that it allows people to choose their own adventure because they're already pre-planning their time in their year I've got tons of people coming in January both in terms of to one off days with one: one but also a retreat at the end of January too and they're I'm getting there I'm coming over

mhm and then you can buy days with me or I I run a retreat every 3 to four months at the moment y so what I found is that in that client stack that it allows people to choose their own adventure because they're already pre-planning their time in their year I've got tons of people coming in January both in terms of to one off days with one: one but also a retreat at the end of January too and they're I'm getting there I'm coming over I'm going to plan the year Etc I'm using The Syndicate which is my community to keep going along and that's the Baseline so I've I've found that having multiple levels just allows people to choose their own adventure but it also maximizes LTV because sometimes people want a couple of hours with me to do a particular job and do that thing but they don't want to commit to one to one ongoing yeah and and I find it's it's offers the highest level of flexibility for me and the highest level of flexibility for them but the other distinction I want to make is a difference between offers and products because when I look at the client stack :00 I've Got The Syndicate and The Syndicate plus one one and then The Syndicate Plus :05 hours and The Syndicate plus Retreats or or VIP days then those are :11 individual products but I can also I have an offer that encompasses all and all I R all I really want to do is get :18 people into my world and then they can choose their own adventure as they go along yeah and that means that I have :23 onethird of people who join The Syndicate get something else within the first six weeks they either get hours or :29 they commit to a retreat or anything that yeah so there's a variable at play here that we need to talk about :34 it's the elephant in the room stress everything you just described :40 sounds hell or it's easy and it's amazing depending on this variable of :45 stress for someone yeah sure and so our business model is really unique :51 and we we'll talk about getting clients and team and things that short but I can't speak for you I have 0% :58 business stress my stress my stress exists with kids bro my 5 my :05 seven-year-old is waking up at in the morning I'm bro I'm losing my mind right so when I have I'm :11 running an event in LA in 6 weeks I have four guest spots the rest of clients :17 I've sold one of those guest spots already I'm confident those three will fill I also don't care I don't have :24 any stress associated with that so if I sent an email and I was I'm going to try and sell some hours I have no :30 attachment to whether or not those hours sell we have very high-profit businesses I have no stress I'm just having fun for :37 most people the challenge is when you have your core office I don't even know what I was using :42 before and they're not working very well and then you add :48 in all of these different things definitely now you've just spread your energy thin and you've increased your :54 stress and so I think that's a really important variable to think about is that until you are at a point where :59 energy is abundant where stress is minimized you should be doing the fewest things humanly possible 100% agree you :06 should be trying to get those things the phrase you used is when it's not working well yeah and the Instinct that people :12 have is when something is not working well is not to make it work well it's to add something else that doesn't work :18 well yeah now you've got two things that don't work well you don't have the you :23 don't understand why the other thing isn't working well so you add

[ __ ] I said said a line the other day I was :28 man I put this up on Twitter it wasn't that good but people were quoting it and I was we would rather :34 throw intensity at new things than throw consistency at old things yeah and I think this is just such an important thing to think about because :40 this is where the Nuance is right there is no right way and no amount of offers :46 that you can or can't have to make a lot of money but it's all predicated on you :51 as the business owner your passions the people you serve your capacity earlier this year the idea of even been :57 having this conversation and entertaining entertaining Live Events and things that would have been so far from my version of reality because I :05 was going through this phase of firing my team and trying to get profits back on track now when I'm sitting down :12 and I've got a community and I've got people who buy one to one and then last week I got my first $112,000 a month :17 client that variable with then there's no structure with that so that's what's even more interesting is there's no set :23 calls I'm just there to help launch a book right that would have been crushing because i' been in the midst of the :29 broken bus I've added in this whole other thing I need to think about and I've got someone texting me so now I've got slack and I've got messenger and :35 I've got someone texting me but now it's great I've got capacity and this is the big thing when people think about business model and offers is that :42 there's no one thing or right thing but there are principles that should guide us sure and stress I think is one of the :47 biggest variables that people need to be aware of you likely won't solve stress by selling more things yeah or hiring :54 this is controversial but the idea that you can just hire your way out of stress can sometimes work but if :00 things are already really bad unless the only stressful thing on your calendar is :06 the thing that that person is going to solve bringing more people into the chaos of your business will likely not make it feel bitter it will make it feel :12 worse yeah I that I that in terms of the selling things will it doesn't take the stress away it it :19 largely adds them yeah I the I go back to sequence and the sequence that you describe :25 before is I think people need to pick up on the fact that you and I aren't the right to :32 go through that sequence really quickly mhm in a pretty similar different timelines but not too dissimilar in :39 terms of what we've done and what we're doing in the amount of time we spending with each other is clearly something's rubbing we share we :45 share a fence guys we share a fence no that's that's that now the cat's out of the bag with that one the news is out we :50 started a cult but the the sequence of oneto one adding a community then you :57 adding higher ticket Mentor it's it's that's mentorship :02 that you're doing now in in the TR in the truest sense because it's unstructured it's how how would you think about that :10 Engagement some people are going to that sequence some people are going to take years to do that because they haven't :16 done all the Reps that you've done y but you can follow the sequence there cuz I followed a similar sequence I got 161 :23 to1 clients at 12 bucks a week yeah and I did that for 4 months and that's all I did and I was in safety because I was :31 making enough money and I was fine and I had Consulting revenue from other things on the side and I was :36 offloading some other things that were still making money but I was offloading those to reduce

that you've done y but you can follow the sequence there cuz I followed a similar sequence I got 161 :23 to1 clients at 12 bucks a week yeah and I did that for 4 months and that's all I did and I was in safety because I was :31 making enough money and I was fine and I had Consulting revenue from other things on the side and I was :36 offloading some other things that were still making money but I was offloading those to reduce the stress :42 because I knew on the other side of the 16 that then I'd add a community and then I made a slight tweak to the one to :48 one which I went from the the same model that you're running which is this is how many calls you get to to variable :54 calls on Demand right which is and that dropped the call volume by 40% which created more capacity but I still didn't :01 raise the number of one to one clients because I'm cool I can get capacity back time and energy to scale but all :07 along the way the hidden thing for me was I only do calls on Tuesday and Thursday so I don't feel stressed :14 whatsoever but because I put put constraints on what I was prepared to do :20 and unprepared to do in terms of feeding those things in so that also I think that helps in not getting caught up with :26 the the nonsense that people have of this is one to one is it scalable is it could questioning the :32 modality when really if you just do calls on Tuesday and Thursday I had an unusually heavy day yesterday did seven :38 calls right and it was that's okay what have I done today yeah come here :44 and talk to you and I went went to breath work and but it's the the sequence I think the thing that :51 people don't miss is that time Dimension that you can go through that sequence really quickly whereas someone listening :56 to this might need to do do that over 3 to four years Y and last note on this before we talk about funnel is sometimes :03 it's not even about logic it's about emotion in the positive sense right can we both double our business by doing :11 nothing else and just growing the things we have yes yes do we want to do other things because it sounds fun yes and so :18 did I need to add an in-person events for my community sell I don't think I did but it sounds fun I'm :24 in La next month running an event I'm in Japan in March running an event that sounds fun and so this is where it's :30 also not about need oh but do we need it's you can get to a point if you have high recurring Revenue High :36 profit low stress you don't have to be super strategic and everything have to be logical you can simply do stuff just :42 cuz you want to do it yeah I'll share this because it's been amusing for me I :49 I have not taken any PID PID and Fs this year really and I controversial I I I do :57 with partner offers CU 20K up front and it's a it's a chunk of work cuz I'm co-writing co-creating an offer with :03 someone but there is no pay plan because we just get straight into it and that's a particular type of type of partnership :09 but for my scalable coaching Consulting I've not taken a :16 painful every month I've increased Revenue by at least 14 to 20% my :23 recurring Revenue proportion is over 80% of monthly Revenue so I'm by all :28 and I'm and I made six figures profit this month M didn't quite make six figures last month but I will this month :34 and by every conceivable metric is going up but it's boring yeah isn't that isn't :41 that weird to say that I felt a couple of times of that grind up of just watching the everything just go up
