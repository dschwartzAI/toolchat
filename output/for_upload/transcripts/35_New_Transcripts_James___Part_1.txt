# New Transcripts James - Part 1

James Kemp: so the install offer the offer install. James Kemp: Here's the doc. James Kemp: If this is your 1st time with us, and you're a guest. Welcome if this is your 1st time with us as a member. Welcome! James Kemp: How these work is! I show you something James Kemp: and talk about why it works and talk about how it works. And then we've got some time to get it to work for you. So there's always a supporting document with these, usually a template. James Kemp: So the supporting dockers and the in the chat. James Kemp: and there's also a template that we'll get to soon. James Kemp: So the install offer this one's pretty cool because it is James Kemp: the highest converting offer I've run for 7 years in terms of how I've deployed it, and also James Kemp: the James Kemp: when I've passed it on to clients. I've seen a very, very fast conversion when this is deployed as well, and it's cool, because it's simple James Kemp: and it goes wrong when it's not simple and it's over complicated. James Kemp: So the the running of an offer driven business James Kemp: is the most efficient route to scale, because James Kemp: when you make offers, and when your prospects receive offers, you create some motion James Kemp: right? And even if the offers aren't working. James Kemp: You still create motion because you create motion for both yourself and your clients, and James Kemp: that puts you in the game. And James Kemp: most of business is not thriving and becoming a billionaire and making this and making that. It's surviving until that opportunity comes along that, creates the outsized returns. If you are not making and delivering on offers frequently, then you are not getting paid or creating results. Frequently James Kemp: it is that simple. If you aren't making offers, you aren't serving people. And in the process of serving people we improve our craft, acquire more skills. We get them results. We create compound effects across the board. James Kemp: If we are not making on deliver and delivering on offers, we are not delivering some level of change in ourselves or other people. We're not delivering some level of transformation in ourselves or other people. We're not really going anywhere. James Kemp: The reason I get paid every day is not because I make offers every day is because I help other people every day, and in the course of that I make offers right? So it's this big, positive circular loop. James Kemp: But what type of offers when how James Kemp: matters to it dictates what results we get, because all offers aren't created equal. All clients aren't created equal. James Kemp: And when I talk about an offer. I'm just making the distinction between a product and offer. James Kemp:, a product is something that we do and deliver on. James Kemp: and that we and and the offer is the wrapper that we put around it, that someone interacts with. James Kemp: that. The offer is the wrapper that we put around something or or a collection of products that someone interacts with interacts with in the sense of, we get their attention for it. And then ultimately, when we have an offer, we promise a result or proximity to a result around it. James Kemp: and we use different offers for different purposes. James Kemp: and discernment and sequencing is required for you relative to where you are right now. James Kemp: So here's 4 types of offer. James Kemp: We have a customer offer that purely creates a buyer James Kemp: that is usually a singular product in that offer it creates a. It creates a buyer, and then we can discern what that buyer needs next, and then turn them into a customer who make the custom of buying

. James Kemp: and discernment and sequencing is required for you relative to where you are right now. James Kemp: So here's 4 types of offer. James Kemp: We have a customer offer that purely creates a buyer James Kemp: that is usually a singular product in that offer it creates a. It creates a buyer, and then we can discern what that buyer needs next, and then turn them into a customer who make the custom of buying. James Kemp: We use that to create cash flow. We create qualified buyers. . I talk a lot about intent. If someone invests in something. Then, no matter the dollar figure, we should be curious about why they invested in that thing at that particular time, for why they're trying to solve. Because then we can ask the magic question, do you want some help with that? James Kemp: So a growth offer is committing to a path James Kemp: of progress over a medium to long term period, and it provides recurring revenue. James Kemp: A transformation offer James Kemp: is that's creating a change that is exceptional relative to the average. So this tends to be coaching, or or a long term coaching engagement. It creates a high margin product, and it creates recurrent revenue. James Kemp: An acquisition offer is a binary offer., people, it's easy for someone to say yes or no to that solves the pressing problem that in the marketplace or solves the pressing problem that you can solve, for James Kemp: that provides clients, and it provides momentum because it's the the faster you can acquire a client, deliver to them and then find the next problem to solve the faster you're in momentum and also require it also creates cash flow. James Kemp: An install offer is an acquisition offer. James Kemp: It is a relatively short duration engagement that solves a specific problem. James Kemp: and that is a very easy offer to say yes or no to for a client. And it's also a very easy offer for you to make in the marketplace, because it's focused and specific. James Kemp: So when we look at the the the matrix of what we have then, ideally. James Kemp: we have an install offer that sits on the front end of our growth offer. James Kemp: So I'll use an example to illustrate that. Better James Kemp: the offer install which is my install offer, which is, there's a lot of tautology, and mixing up the order of words here because I do what I teach and teach what I do. James Kemp: The the offer installers the 1st 13 weeks of the syndicate with a couple of little sprinkle add-ons that what that means is my delivery can be maintained the same. James Kemp: I on board someone. I get on a call with them. I set a direction. They get access to the group calls and a direction on training and feedback. And then that continuum that gives me the opportunity to sell to someone over a short duration period without promising or talking about a 12 month. Transformation allows them to get started, and then also allows us to have a conversation after 13 weeks of whether they want to stay in that engagement. James Kemp: And approximately 80% of people do stay past that 13 weeks. James Kemp: So the install offer and an acquisition offer has a dual purpose. It it allows us to get customer clients quickly, but it also allows us to bring clients into our world and have the opportunity to keep them over the long term when it's part of a when it's part of a pathway and it and it syncs up with the offer behind it. James Kemp: and it's optimal to have a growth offer that a client can continue with at the conclusion. But it's not essential if you just want clients. Now, when you want to get started and and you want to get rolling anything. Making the offer is the most important thing

. James Kemp: and it's optimal to have a growth offer that a client can continue with at the conclusion. But it's not essential if you just want clients. Now, when you want to get started and and you want to get rolling anything. Making the offer is the most important thing. James Kemp: the James Kemp: one mindset that is very useful to inhabit in the world of help. Whether you're a consultant, a mentor, a coach, or a service provider. James Kemp: is that the offer and the promise you're about to make already exist in the marketplace. In some form, right? James Kemp: Desire is everywhere. James Kemp: People want things that they don't have right now all over the shop. James Kemp: Right? Problems are everywhere. James Kemp: People want stuff to go away and be solved for all over the place, and more desire, and more problems are created than solutions. every single day. James Kemp: so opportunity is bottomless, and the central key to speed of conversion James Kemp: is turning existing desire into immediate demand. James Kemp: If you watch the the call that I had with Lana earlier in the week, we talk about what's already present in the marketplace. James Kemp: What's already? What's already happening? What do people want right now and then? We're just looking for something that meets that existing desire, and that demand. James Kemp: and the more pressing the problem. James Kemp: the more acute and immediate. That demand will be James Kemp: right if you turned up. If someone had got their leg chopped off. And you said, Do you want me to stop the bleeding? You don't need to send them a Google Doc and put them on a 45 min call to put them through a sales process to get. Forget them to say yes, please. I'd you to stop the bleeding right and and metaphorically, there are people in your that match. The skill set that you've got out in the marketplace, bleeding or pining for things that they don't currently have. James Kemp: So it sounds so trite and overly simple. James Kemp: We sell things that people want and especially in James Kemp: the coaching and consulting and expert market. James Kemp: Most people have a really difficult time of getting out of the way of the of ideals, and you hear this in language . James Kemp: they need to have this, and they should have this, and they must want this, which are projections out into a marketplace James Kemp: of James Kemp: knowledge that you possess, that the market doesn't yet possess. Oh, you need you. You should have a Crm. And you're dude. I've got 5 clients, I can, name them, and I know their birthdays. But, to a Crm expert you need a Crm, because that's just what happens. That's what you need to organize things. They don't. They need something right now, and offers that offers that work meet that James Kemp: meet that market right there. James Kemp: The 2 central killers of offers that people don't want the thing that you're selling. James Kemp: Coaches are notorious for making things for themselves, and then thinking that everybody else should want it. James Kemp: And it's not clear what outcome they get. James Kemp: So we simply solve for this. And this is a requirement of much as a surrender requirement rather than a force requirement. We solve for this by having a hypothesis developed from real world data or experience. And that is, people are already buying this off someone else. That is a positive market signal they've asked. They've asked you for it before. That is a positive market signal

We solve for this by having a hypothesis developed from real world data or experience. And that is, people are already buying this off someone else. That is a positive market signal they've asked. They've asked you for it before. That is a positive market signal. James Kemp: and more commonly, it's a thing you're already delivering to clients, and it unfolds in the process that that's a particular thing that clients love or or clients want. James Kemp: and we solve for clarity by promising one clear outcome over one time period. James Kemp: The further we get away and the more dimensions we get away from these these simple truths, the lower the chance of velocity and outcomes. James Kemp: And again, I'm going to beat up on pretty much everybody. James Kemp: just because you want something doesn't mean the market wants it. James Kemp: and we must understand what the market wants to to meet the market where they are. James Kemp: I think it was a Dan Kennedyism, but, into the conversation, and that's already happening in their head. Right? And and all desire and problems are already out in the marketplace. And we just need to turn that into demand with an offer. James Kemp: and we do that through a simple equation. James Kemp: So we have a specific outcome James Kemp: over a specific timeframe. And then we convert James Kemp: specific outcome is either very easy to point at, very prescriptive and specific and objective, and a specific timeframe is that. How long will that take, or how long are we going to engage together. James Kemp: When a prospect clearly see what happens in the future, they can make a clear, buying decision. James Kemp: It's important to understand in the world of services. The thing that we're selling doesn't exist right James Kemp: in physical products. When you go and buy a car and you're going into the showroom and someone points at the car. And you're, I want that one. But it's black James Kemp: that has a physicality in existence James Kemp: which is tangible, right? We sell things that don't exist yet, because the future hasn't happened yet. So the clearer the picture that we insert in someone's mind of what is going to happen in the future, the more tangible our offer becomes, and the more tangible our offer is, the more viable because it fundamentally feels real right. James Kemp: So as with any equation James Kemp: the the defined inputs create the defined outputs. The smaller the promise, the more easy it is to keep and the more specificity we have around what gets done, and over what time period, the higher the conversion. James Kemp: the further again, the further we get away from that, the slower it is, and the harder it is to sell and the less quality of the data that we get. James Kemp: So here is my install offer called the offer install. It's not confusing whatsoever. James Kemp: This is the reason these work as well is because they're very, very short and we had this conversation in the syndicate Michael, who's a, one of the best salespeople and and sales trainers in the world, talking about the mindset of offers and a huge, a huge component that we're talking about on Tuesday was. James Kemp: things that are easy to say no to right and specific offers are easy to say no to, because they're not relevant for that particular person. James Kemp: Your offer should be as easy to say No as as it is to say yes to, because the right person says yes, and also the right person says no

. James Kemp: things that are easy to say no to right and specific offers are easy to say no to, because they're not relevant for that particular person. James Kemp: Your offer should be as easy to say No as as it is to say yes to, because the right person says yes, and also the right person says no. James Kemp: So I'll go through line by line about what works. So obviously, we've got the headline. James Kemp: We? We do limited openings. So we want a high velocity offer ecosystem. So we offer less than we can possibly supply. James Kemp: If you can service 10 people right. Now, then, opening it up for 4 means that you offer less supply to the market than you're prepared to fulfill, and you aim to generate more demand than supply. James Kemp: I say it every week, but the way to run a low stress business is having much more demand than supply, and the way to have high demand and low supply is meter. The supply and release it, and stagger, stagger its release, but also generate as much demand as possible. So you'll always you've always got an overflow. That means you're never chasing people. You're never wondering where the next clients come from, because largely people have missed out on your last offer. James Kemp: So I to start with a qualifier. James Kemp: the the common qualifier, and the market for help. The market for coaching or consulting is, people have gone through something, and they have gone into a program. And it wasn't very good, or they didn't get high levels of access, or they didn't get the specific outcome. And they left feeling James Kemp: all I was told to do was watch lots of videos and go on a Facebook group and maybe turn up to some calls once in a while. Right? So I specifically call out the people who already have the solution awareness. James Kemp: what you need is a high, converting offer for your audience. Right? It's baked in about the about the requirements that we have. James Kemp: They believe the solution to their lack of sales is high converting offer, and they have an audience. James Kemp: What they don't want to do is watch hundreds of videos get more generic advice. Put your prices up, etc. They want specific help and targeting right? And then I put the this is what I do. This is what I do. James Kemp: This is what I do every day. I do it for myself, and this is what's going to get done. So this is how we partner together, we combine your delivery and audience with my offer creation skills. James Kemp: This is what it is. This is me, you and some Google Docs and some zoom time. Right? So I've created the specific credit, the specific environment that we got to operate under. And then I'm really clear about what it is. James Kemp: or the central piece that people are buying? Is this everything else around it? All the access they get to trainings, all the access they get to a group. And all those things their benefits. They're not core propositions of the offer. James Kemp: Our goal is at least 10 k. In new revenue. Here's some examples of what happens when people do this. These are not typical. There is no cap with the right offer for your audience, which is true, because I've engaged with someone here, and the offer made over a million dollars twice., so, there is no upper limit. But the promise is very manageable and very measurable for someone who's got, just some basic things that I can work with. James Kemp: you understand? Over 12 weeks we install in cash flow one client offer generating at least 10 K. In sales. James Kemp: Right? It's binary

., so, there is no upper limit. But the promise is very manageable and very measurable for someone who's got, just some basic things that I can work with. James Kemp: you understand? Over 12 weeks we install in cash flow one client offer generating at least 10 K. In sales. James Kemp: Right? It's binary. James Kemp: If you don't want that James Kemp: right fine, it's you don't need that right now. You don't benefit from it. You don't see the benefit from it, etc. James Kemp: It is easy to say no to not either. That's not my priority right now. I need more leads or no., I'm already at 7 figures, and 10 K, is my coffee bill for next month. Right? So it's it's it's it's right in the pocket of relevance of someone who's a good fit for me and the syndicate, who's probably at between 10 and 30 KA month, who's looking to reorganize things and make them more stable and more efficient. James Kemp: And then I go into a little bit of why offers are important, and then we unpack, and we future pace what happens. James Kemp: So get clear on your ideal market and co-create a client, offer to get some results within the minimum of you. James Kemp: We use a hybrid office, or I insert a mechanism into there and then, in phase 2. I explain what cash flowing is. Right. So we cash flow the offer and work to tap on these new clients. I'll leave you with an offering system that you can run every single month James Kemp: with. I'll talk about ascension and pricing, and how we do it in a moment. If someone buys this and they stay with me for 13 weeks and they go off happy. Then I'm happy if someone buys this, and they stay with me for 13 weeks, and they stay in the syndicate and then stay with me forever. I'm happy. The result delivers. James Kemp: no matter what. There is not holding anything back from the future. The offer is the offer, and it's designed to get the result James Kemp: right, and then again reiterate that. So what we do together, I reiterate what gets done, how it works. So I front load the delivery of these. So we get on a 1 to one call. We do the offer. There's probably a small amount of homework for the people to go for the person to go away with, and then I drop them into the infrastructure I've already got. So that person gets access to the syndicate calls, gets access to the trainings, etc. James Kemp: So again, that's a benefit. James Kemp: That's not the core proposition of the offer. But once they're in, as with, people are coming to the syndicate calls and says, Well, I want to stick around. I this group, etc, etc. Then they go James Kemp: the investment I'll talk about. I use pay as you profit in a few different ways. I'll talk about this in more detail in a moment. But. James Kemp: this James Kemp: template covers. I don't use this pricing right now. But this one is 5 K. Now 5 K. When we hit 10 k. Of sales. James Kemp: and I put the pay plan secondary. So I'll let you finance the initial 5 K. Over 12 weeks at 500 per week. James Kemp: Then I have a qualifier. You're probably doing these things. You're probably dissatisfied with this. You have these things right? James Kemp: And we are more defined. James Kemp: What about who we don't work with and who we do
