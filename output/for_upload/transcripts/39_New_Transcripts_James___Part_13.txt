# New Transcripts James - Part 13

. And that's the same characteristic of every offer that is, it was for, it was for something I saw with one person and then it, the scale comes from the trust that well, if it's really useful and really good for one person, then it's probably good for 10. Yeah. Maybe a hundred and maybe 400. Yeah. And maybe, and so I think the, there's the, we have the ability to scratch our own itch because the other place that a lot of offers, the best offers come from is scratching my own niche, but the other place they come from is scratching other people's where I'm, I know how to get them out of the, I know how to get them out of this. I know how to, maybe even save them from this because they're stuck in a funnel builder pushing buttons and wiring about the f*****g drop shadow and what color the button's gonna be and all that stuff. Right. And I know how to solve for this, right? That, that, that's, that's one, one of the point of the, AI tool we're building for, workshops, is that you don't have to go into the funnel builder because I've seen so many people get stuck there of, where's the button going? It's, it doesn't f*****g matter. So the tool doesn't output the funnel. It outputs the CSS that you copy and paste in the funnel and you don't need to go near it because the funnel is the output. So we skip the bit that I know people get stuck in because they're dragging boxes around. And that's how I think about these things of the scratching a itch that I've got, but also scratching a itch of one person because this wonderful thing called the internet has allowed us to find, before we could find the one person or, or two or three, and now we can find 10 or a hundred or a thousand or a million who who we can help with doing that one thing. Yeah. And the best offers for me come from one place for one person and then scale because, it turns out that hundreds or thousands of people want that. Yeah, You're welcome. Elizabeth, formerly Lizie., Could I just say, could I just say something else as well? Can I just, can I just joke about this for a second? It would be so funny if we just kept talking until no one was here. We just, just fast forward a few hours and we're just still, yeah man. So I, anyway, I just think it's so funny just holding everyone captive. If I was to launch something brand new today, I would personally invite the first 10 people to it. I wouldn't, I wouldn't use attraction, I would use curation. Right. And I would not be, that could go into tactically cold messaging people and just get it from a, from a sense that, hey, I've got something that might be might be for you. Yeah. Because if we're, we only get to start something once, a lot of the things we've built have, have taken pivots and turns and those things, but there was only, there was only one set of initial conditions for everything. Yeah. And if we're starting again, the initial conditions we set in terms of the who and the, and the things we do, I'm talking about for relevancy matters so much because that's the initial conditions that we build from. And so I wouldn't, I wouldn't go out there and say I'm doing this and this is it and I'm gonna sell you on this. I would go, I'd write one page on a Google doc and I'd and I'd go people and say, I've got something I'd think you might . Yeah

. And so I wouldn't, I wouldn't go out there and say I'm doing this and this is it and I'm gonna sell you on this. I would go, I'd write one page on a Google doc and I'd and I'd go people and say, I've got something I'd think you might . Yeah. And I, I, 'cause I think you're the person who would add to it. Because if we, if we have additive businesses where we bring people in who improve the environment rather than I've got another client who's gonna take all the stuff and then we can build these gigantic flywheels. And that's not based on what we do, that's based on who's in it. Yeah. I don't know if we can all laugh at how crap I am at marketing, but there's somewhere, there's some lesson that I'm reflecting on around this attraction promotion piece. I got 14 clients last month that's an average of, 10 plus whatever, on a normal month. And I do very little promotion these days. Everything's automated. you'll see probably two stories a month of, Hey, if you're on the fence, you should message me in a circle. Almost everything else is just VSL doing its thing. The last three days I emailed the entire list, however many, I don't know how big my list is. Let's say it's maybe 9,000, 10,000 people of a 72 hour window. I had not one person come through at that time. I think, or maybe one, maybe you could count one. And the more indirect I go with promotion, the more money I make when I truly to, this is, I don't know how to teach this. 'cause I'm, this is so unhelpful. Whenever I do not think about making money ever and I don't think about promotion and I simply think about creation, I make way more money. And when I try and go, oh, I'm going to, I'm gonna promote something, I'm making less money. I don't know, I know that's obviously not true for everyone. And across the board, I'm observing this with myself where I will think about a client or think about a potential client and then three hours later they'll reach out and it's almost psychic attraction. But then when I try and go after promotion, it doesn't work. And I found, I found this to be, you and I talked about this a bunch where it's, I went really hard with it in August and got 30 clients in 30 days. And I was, man, I, no one could fault me for being a bad marketer. It's clearly working. It just doesn't feel me. And the more that I promote anything, the more I hate what I do and the more I just create and then attract people, the easier everything feels. And I don't know what the lesson is other than I notice that I'm getting worse at promotion. And the more I, the more I talk about working with me, the less anyone wants to work with me. And the less I talk about working with me, the more people wanna work with me. It's, it's funny, it's funny, I'm running, I'm running three front-end offers at $9 each with a $29 bump. Yeah. And the bumps the same. And that, one ad set one, one product is front end profitable slightly. One's back and forth between below neutral and one's not working at all. Yeah. Then it's hooked up to the cash campaign and it's selling a a $500 or a $3,000 offer, automated the whole way through in the past, Thursday now. So since Saturday there's been one to two conversions from the cash campaign every day. Right

. Yeah. And the bumps the same. And that, one ad set one, one product is front end profitable slightly. One's back and forth between below neutral and one's not working at all. Yeah. Then it's hooked up to the cash campaign and it's selling a a $500 or a $3,000 offer, automated the whole way through in the past, Thursday now. So since Saturday there's been one to two conversions from the cash campaign every day. Right. Which is what, how much?, 500 or 3000. So there's one 3000 and then all the rest for 501 time. Yeah. So that campaign is now fully profitable. I'm not sure what the ROAS is, but, probably by the numbers it's probably, three times ROAS and it scales. Mm-hmm. Right. And I'm bored of it already. Yeah. it's a money printing machine. Yeah. Right. And if I keep putting money in and I keep feeding creative in it and it will just keep going. It's just there. Yeah. And I, and there's three pages, 11 emails and that's it. And it's really unfulfilling and really boring. Oh, I get it. And now I'm putting numbers into a spreadsheet. Yeah. What what's your, what's your point you're getting at here as in, it's working and you'll keep doing It, but making money is boring as in, and once how to do it, The Yeah. But what do you think the lesson is for you, right now? as in is it, is it making you go, do I want to do this and spend two grand? 'cause for me it was I was, I spent $200 to give a client last Night. I'm get the s**t Outta it. Yeah. So talk to us about that. Because, 'cause there's a, there's, there's a part of me that you are saying, boring for me, I don't care if it'd gimme a 10 x that's not interesting to me. I hear boring. And I go, I don't wanna do that. But for you, there's something else there. So what, what do you think that Is? I it's the, what is it? It's the ma it's the, I've mastered the, I've mastered, where's the, where's the upper limits of the game? how far can I push this thing? Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. And there's gonna be a day, there's gonna be a day in the next few weeks or the next few months where I'm, oh my God. 'cause I'm, my ad spend will be five grand or something. Yeah. And I'll be, I, there's a big donut on it and I lose 5K and then I do it the next day and then I'll be, I don't this game anymore. Sucks. Yeah. It's not fun on those days. Yeah. I I I think, I think it's the once you, once you have one or two simple things Yeah. Then gamifying everything else for interest and fun is the way that everything else flows. Yeah. And I think I've been through the cycle enough to also know that, unleashing that. So I will teach it and then I'll let other people play with it and then I'll learn things. And to me, the learning, the learning is the most fun thing. Yeah. That when I teach something and someone goes and takes some of it, but it ignores the other things that I told them to do and makes it work. I don't go, well you are clearly not a good student. I go, tell me how this worked. So Right

. So I will teach it and then I'll let other people play with it and then I'll learn things. And to me, the learning, the learning is the most fun thing. Yeah. That when I teach something and someone goes and takes some of it, but it ignores the other things that I told them to do and makes it work. I don't go, well you are clearly not a good student. I go, tell me how this worked. So Right. The curiosity of, the curiosity is the most fulfilling thing because I'm endlessly curious about how far this funnel thing can go. Then I'm endlessly curious about how those ideas spread and, and then curious about what other people can do to completely break my brain in terms of the assumptions that I've made to do it, to teach me something that makes me better. And that that's the, that's the, the quest of mastery is, okay, now I've, I've got this idea and I've got it working and now I need to let it go because I don't really know s**t. Right. It's that someone else is gonna come along and, buckle the assumptions that I thought I had about this, about how what's good and what's bad and, and, and do a better job than me is exciting. It's not Yeah. Yeah. It's not threatening at all. Well I think this is the no, the old ancient wisdom of know thyself. And this is why I think you and I have been able to collaborate so much over the years is, we are very similar in conviction and values, which is why we are such good friends. And how that expresses itself can in some instances be similar and in other ways be different. So you, someone asked a question about your $10 million a year goal. And, for me, one of the differences that I, I found at least, I don't know if this is com completely true for you., but you seem to be less distracted when you do have money goals. And I feel really distracted when I have money goals. Mm-hmm., I, I wouldn't I, if you ever see me publicly talking about, I'm gonna make this much money. I'm telling you all right now I'm super off track. send me to a shaman in brew. Dan's back on the ba back on the business hams wheel. 'cause it's so uninteresting to me, the most money I've ever made with ease has always been accidental. It's never been, 'cause I had a money goal. every time I've said I wanna make this much money, I personally go off track. And so when you talk about this funnel, I Do, you can I, can I share something? Yes. I, I knew modern autonomy wouldn't work for you. I knew it would work when you told me how much money it was gonna make. Yeah. What do you mean? Before I launched or after? Before. Oh yeah, yeah. Because you had this very rational output and I'm, yeah, Yeah. Which is not me at All. Your mass is correct. It will do that a hundred percent. And then it did do that. Yeah. And then I also knew that it wouldn't do it for you. Oh, completely. When, when you explained, when you said this is how much money it's gonna make. And I was, your your working is correct. Yeah. I just wanna get paid to exist. I'm trying to gamify it so much where my business model is. So there's not an ounce of obligation in anything. That's the game for me. And then it's how much money can that bring in? that's a fun game to play as a byproduct. But anytime I've focused on money outside of my first 10 KA month, it's only brought me misery

. And I was, your your working is correct. Yeah. I just wanna get paid to exist. I'm trying to gamify it so much where my business model is. So there's not an ounce of obligation in anything. That's the game for me. And then it's how much money can that bring in? that's a fun game to play as a byproduct. But anytime I've focused on money outside of my first 10 KA month, it's only brought me misery. It's never brought me closer to my higher self. I've never become a better human because I set a money goal. There's, there's no version of us that's instantly happier because we doubled our income. you can create freedom, but you don't just instantly create a new version of yourself that has a higher baseline happiness, a lower baseline stress level simply because you make more money and in most cases you double the money. You doubled the stress In most cases. Yeah. Yeah. No, of course not every case. But it's that, that for me has been a huge, huge, lesson for me is money is a terrible north star for me personally. Creativity, self-expression. How do I gamify the system? So I feel I'm a glitch in the matrix who somehow tapped into the infinite money supply on World of Warcraft and has found the cheat code. That's the game I want to play. Yeah. The paid to exist frame is is is available to everybody. Yeah., Manuel asked, this is my first call here. Do we get a replay? A hundred percent. You get a replay, in the respective community. Dan, Dan doesn't, Dan doesn't have a Zoom password so it's VA's gotta do it. That also might be accurate. I think that's, that's, when you were talking about building landing pages before, I was, oh man, I've not done that in years. I don't even know how to log in to go high level. I don't know how to send an email and go high level at all. I send my VA at WhatsApp message and I say email, entire list, subject this, message this. And then she sends it, which means it's completely on her time zone. So I can never send an email on real time. And it's amazing., guys, we should probably call it, 'cause honestly James and I could gas bag here all day., I hope it's been insightful for you to at least pull away, pull a couple of threads from our rants to just self-reflect If we could distill anything. I know I speak for James when I say, the most important advice is, find the thing that works best for you and do that. Do you feel that's a fair summarization James? Or do you feel it's more about, get high testosterone and marry a Brazilian Well cool. A call, book a call. I've got a $4,800 offer to sell sell You this, this too could be yours. Can I tell a, can I tell a really quick story? Yeah. guys, guys, you're allowed to jump off at any point In the, in the early, in the early days of Uplevel with Sam, if you got to, I think it was a million. You got a, you got a VIP day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. On a jet. I didn't get a jet. Oh you well you that was the whole thing. You got a jet. Sorry. Anyway, I better message him now and say you f*****g owe me a jet man., but you got a VIP day and he is, I was in Auckland at the time and he said, I'm coming back, coming back to New Zealand this day. And I was, oh, that works

. Yeah, yeah, yeah. On a jet. I didn't get a jet. Oh you well you that was the whole thing. You got a jet. Sorry. Anyway, I better message him now and say you f*****g owe me a jet man., but you got a VIP day and he is, I was in Auckland at the time and he said, I'm coming back, coming back to New Zealand this day. And I was, oh, that works. And so I met him at Sky City in Auckland and we, hung out, went to breakfast and then, we'd spent the day together. Right. Just, we're just wandering around and sitting at different places and, and, and, I was selling e-commerce engine at the time and, I'd done my first mill and it was, it was good. And what do I do next? And, the, the only advice I came away with put the price up to 4,800. It was two and a half grand at the time. It was, it was just, just put the price up and I made one change to the whole thing and I put the price up the next day and sold it on the phone and nothing changed and then I just made more money. So Yeah, if you haven't, if you haven't had a 4,800 later on, it was 5,800 and then it was 6,800., offer. Where have you even been for the last 10 years? Yeah, bro. Scaling Hustle bros. I liked that one. I thought that was funny., yeah, Sam's such a funny dude. Dude, I really, I hung out with Sam twice when during Covid and after the second time I thought to myself, we probably don't need to do that again. 'cause I felt we talked about everything we could possibly talk about. It was the first day was three, three hours of four hours. The second day was three hours and it was just, yeah, I'm think, I think I'm good. Nah, not to say anything about Sam. I just felt we, we, it was only deep chat and there was no chemistry of e ease of just hang, hanging out. No, I felt we exhausted all of the esoteric, esoteric angles of online acquisition and religion and life., cool man. I appreciate you. I love your time and, yeah, all the best. All the best with the new birth dude. Yeah, she's, we're going for a walk soon, so we'll try and Get her do some star jumps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool.

Oh, I'll go next door now and just remove half the stuff and put it in the, in the new Folder. Dude. Anything in my office man, go check it out. Go check it out. 'cause we have so much stuff there. Yeah. So much stuff in that office. It's just I know. Go take it. Go rob me an Apple store. This is what I do. This is how I work dude. I buy something to see if I it and then I, I have a 16 inch MacBook Pro there. Tried it out. Wasn't for me, but now I've tickled that part of my brain where I'm, your Whole family hates Apple watches as well. There seems to be a few of those around.
