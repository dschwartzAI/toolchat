# New Transcripts James - Part 2

. When we hit 10 k. Of sales. James Kemp: and I put the pay plan secondary. So I'll let you finance the initial 5 K. Over 12 weeks at 500 per week. James Kemp: Then I have a qualifier. You're probably doing these things. You're probably dissatisfied with this. You have these things right? James Kemp: And we are more defined. James Kemp: What about who we don't work with and who we do. James Kemp: People need some basic stuff for this to work. People need James Kemp: at least the identification of an audience. And they need something to sell James Kemp: for most of for most people that I work within this. It's not a lack of opportunity to produce an install offer or produce something this. It's an abundance because they help people with about 10 different things, and then we isolate it down to one. In my experience that's much more common than a beginner coming along and say, I don't have a skill, and I don't know what to do. The people who come to me tend to have too many skills, and then we're sharpening them and refining them down. James Kemp: So pricing the pricing is elegant. Shall we say so? James Kemp: If you, if you look at the frame acquisition offers are generally sold to people who have not been clients before. They may have bought low ticket offers. They may have bought customer offers from you. They may even be in a a membership, or something that, where they have a low level of access to you. James Kemp: but they have not had direct and intimate access before. And they're stepping up another trust level. And they're stepping up another pricing level. James Kemp: So James Kemp: reducing perceived risk and opening the door for them to continue with you is we can bake into pricing. James Kemp: So the way that I price these that I found most effective over the years is having a risk, reversal pricing or a risk reduction pricing. There's no such thing as risk removal James Kemp: where there is an upfront payment, and then a secondary payment. Once the milestone is hit. James Kemp: This works on 2 fronts, which is why I love it because it reduces the risk, because you are sharing some of the risk by saying, I will delay. James Kemp: I will delay the payment of this until the results turn. James Kemp: but it also enables you to have a secondary conversation once the result is achieved, you then have James Kemp: the the the energy of the money there that you can deploy in the right way. So what I do is I say James Kemp: you don't owe me 5 K. What I'm going to do is credit that against the next year of the syndicate, and that makes your your weekly payment. Just X. If you'd to stick around. James Kemp: So what that does is deploys the energy of that potential money, and it turns it into a potential benefit for the client that they can then James Kemp: cash in without going into their pocket, because it's free money that then they can deploy to invest over the long term. James Kemp: And that means that we can use that potential energy of that dollar figure to deploy something and and help someone make it easy to stick around, but also allow them to potentially open up a world where they step up in terms of the level of service, or even just stick around, even at a lower level. James Kemp: So I found that that style of pricing extremely effective. And it's obviously relative the the dollar figure James Kemp: is relative to the offer that you've got in the market. You've got, if you're selling to corporate. Then 5 K is way too low. If you're selling, probably fitness and personal transformation, it's probably pretty high

. James Kemp: So I found that that style of pricing extremely effective. And it's obviously relative the the dollar figure James Kemp: is relative to the offer that you've got in the market. You've got, if you're selling to corporate. Then 5 K is way too low. If you're selling, probably fitness and personal transformation, it's probably pretty high. But that if you match the figures, a thousand and a thousand, 2,000 22,000 20,000. Then I've seen it work at all those particular levels. I've seen it work at 50 K and 50 k. As well. James Kemp: So the that offer structure when you've got a growth offer on the back of it works very well to convert pricing structure. Rather, it also very works very well to ascend. James Kemp: So I just wanna before we jump into Q. And A. I just want to talk about delivery and some of the new ones here. James Kemp: The delivery of my install offer has 1 1 on one call right. James Kemp: there will be. If you. If you make a promise. James Kemp: you will have a level of customization and delivering your offer. If you want to control the outcome. James Kemp: I am leaving too much to chance. If I have an offer this, and I just throw someone into the community and go have at it and work it out and watch the trainings right? That works at a low investment level where I can't dedicate the time to to, directing that person and giving them a plan. But but at higher investment levels, where you're promising an roi. James Kemp: you need to control the the flow as much as you can, because you still rely on the client to do some work, to to a greater or lesser extent. James Kemp: so all to say, there will be a level of customization involved in delivering your offer. James Kemp: Get that done early and quickly. If that means that you need multiple one on one calls or intensive service delivery in the 1st few days of the 1st week of the client engagement, do it, then James Kemp: front, load the delivery to set up the conditions for success. So you've got the next 7, 12, James Kemp: 15 weeks to unpack the result James Kemp: the the faster this is completed, the faster the client is in motion, and the faster you can move to the next client, which is increased capacity. James Kemp: If you want to run a small lean business with just you, and, minimal overhead to minimal infrastructure. James Kemp: The velocity that you clear clients through the system James Kemp: is matters more than most things about your growth potential, right? Because James Kemp: every time you have a level of customization you're doing a service, or you're one on one with a client. It has energy expenditure, right. James Kemp: how much James Kemp: how much it takes out of you, shall we say for a call, or doing work, or writing copy, or delivering, delivering pieces for the client

. It has energy expenditure, right. James Kemp: how much James Kemp: how much it takes out of you, shall we say for a call, or doing work, or writing copy, or delivering, delivering pieces for the client. James Kemp: the the if you, if you meter those and get them towards the front of it, and then you move through into a lower touch or a lower stress environment, you'll be able to put more clients through the system right? James Kemp: What tends to happen with most people is that they try and stretch out the delivery over a longer period of time, and then they then they end up clogging the system because they've got so much delivery liability coming up that they can't sell the people now right? I could sell the off the offer in store every week and just roll James Kemp: I I want, okay, I'm gonna do 5 1 on one calls next week, and then I'm gonna sell it next week and do 5 1 on one calls the week after. If I had, if I stretch those out I would be compounding that delivery responsibility right? And this is really James Kemp: subtle, and the people who have delivered to any level will know what I'm talking about. But if you stretch out and you start offering a lot of service delivery and you try and flatten it over multiple weeks or even months. James Kemp: you severely limit your ability to grow on the front end because you can't take in and ingest clients, and then get them through because you are compounding delivery because you are setting up multiple hours of delivery in the future, and that clock that limits your ability to to sign a client now. James Kemp: So what I do is, again, in the what we do together. I'm clear about how how it works. We do an offer install call with me. We create, offers, campaigns, messages, copy, and strategy. James Kemp: Then I direct the client. I direct the person to. Once we've completed that offer. Sometimes we complete it fully on the call. If it's if it's super simple. Often there's a little bit to get done. Then I I tell them to bring it back to me for feedback. We've got 2 calls a week. We've got a community. So we've got multiple touch points. James Kemp: So this is very scalable for me, because there's 1 1 on one component which is the lowest leverage thing I do, and then it's into a high leverage environment where we can provide feedback adequately. But that one on one call establishes the specificity of the offer, the timeframe and the frame around it, and then I've got assets that sit around that to make it scalable. James Kemp: so James Kemp: all to say, front load delivery, and compress it into the shortest period of time possible with the most intensive pieces. The more you do that, the more you can move through clients and sign them up. James Kemp: Wants to do an install offer. James Kemp: No, Jared. Jarred Brown: I'd love to. And then and if I can ask a question just about that, so you're just Jarred Brown: peaking the terms and centralizing their focus for the start of their syndicate experience. right, that's all. It is Jarred Brown: My question before we trial it out Jarred Brown: with with mine. It does. It does the length. Jarred Brown: But what's the minimum length in which you would do it? And does it? Does the pricing Jarred Brown: just the even split matter. So someone joins the summit. It's a 3 k. Painful for the year. Jarred Brown: which means half of that would be 1,500

. It is Jarred Brown: My question before we trial it out Jarred Brown: with with mine. It does. It does the length. Jarred Brown: But what's the minimum length in which you would do it? And does it? Does the pricing Jarred Brown: just the even split matter. So someone joins the summit. It's a 3 k. Painful for the year. Jarred Brown: which means half of that would be 1,500. Half of the time would be 6 months, could I? Could I bring it down to 4 weeks. Jarred Brown: Or is that, okay, cool, are we able to to jam on that potentially James Kemp: in in real terms. The faster someone gets a result, the more valuable the offer Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: If you had an offer that says, Well, I promise to make a million dollars with you in the next 7 days. James Kemp: it would sell pretty well Jarred Brown: It would James Kemp: Right. So the faster the faster you can generate a result. James Kemp: and the more meaningful that result is to the individual. James Kemp: the the simpler that offer is to sell. Jarred Brown: And so Jarred Brown: deliver a specific mechanism over a short period of time. The one on one calls. Surrounded by that mechanism, they fall into the summit, and then the full way to the summit is just us. Jarred Brown:, on this going back and forth around that that particular one mechanism. Jarred Brown: So then, if it's a 4 week experience, would I just then apply that credit as, if you would to continue with this and just apply that credit, so my pricing might not be an even split. My! But how would I then frame up the how do you think I could position the Jarred Brown: pay now and then pay then. position. How would I frame that up with the ideal of them moving into the summit James Kemp: You don't have that ideal. And this is, this is where the danger arises. Right? James Kemp: You have to fucking. Deliver on the offer. James Kemp: If you're just doing this as a way to get them into a 12 month thing, you will fail Jarred Brown: Okay. Ideal wasn't the wrong way. James Kemp: By night. By then you a a a workshop. What did I say a couple of weeks ago? James Kemp: Deliver everything on the workshop. Every outcome is out of your control. Jarred Brown: Every outcome of decision making of what the client make is out of your control. James Kemp: Everybody who's not a member of the membership or the syndicate here is they're nuts right James Kemp: by not being members, but they will. They will come to that conclusion on their own. James Kemp: But delivering in a workshop is about delivering in the workshop, delivering in an acquisition offer is about delivering on the thing. What happens after we set up the conditions for it to happen. James Kemp: But if you have a I'm going to do this, so I can get this James Kemp: it it will not get this Jarred Brown: Sorry I was meaning more. I I completely understand it and completely agree with you. I was meaningful more from the pricing perspective. How do you feel I can play with that pricing frame? If I'm if I'm gonna offer and trial out a 4 week experience, you've got the the 5 K. Now 5 k. Then Jarred Brown: how would I position that with the contrast of the summit for the other 48 years James Kemp: I, Jarred Brown: 40 James Kemp: Let's do it, because that's talking in the theoretical is pointless. Jarred Brown: Okay. Cool

. Now 5 k. Then Jarred Brown: how would I position that with the contrast of the summit for the other 48 years James Kemp: I, Jarred Brown: 40 James Kemp: Let's do it, because that's talking in the theoretical is pointless. Jarred Brown: Okay. Cool. James Kemp: What are you going to do? Jarred Brown: The the big one is the alter ego at the minute, which is Comp comes down to confidence and hesitation. So it's the alter ego advantage, which is what it's called Jarred Brown: The main things that are popping up and people joining the summit recently have all been around Jarred Brown: hesitating key. Moments. self doubt. And so the alter ego is all around. Confidence, hesitation, Stutter holding back in the performance. Jarred Brown: So it's Jarred Brown: a good athlete or an okay athlete will see something. Think about it, may not do it. A great athlete will see it, act on it instinctively, and go after James Kemp: That I. James Kemp: It's e ea a LTEE r right Jarred Brown: Yeah. Yeah. Jarred Brown: Nope. James Kemp: How long. Jarred Brown: Full weights James Kemp: So here you'd put I coach James Kemp: you put something alter egos one of the many components I install into my professional clients. James Kemp: Luckily for you, I'll I I can do this as a 1 off Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: Which is just Jarred Brown: Would you James Kemp: Component after it Jarred Brown: Where would you use the whereabouts would you use Jarred Brown: in the summit? Step 4. Where would you use the language when you break down that in your Jarred Brown: my summer off a dock as an example James Kemp: I understand. Jarred Brown: So I just punched it. Jarred Brown: I just punched it in the chat. But . Jarred Brown:, what is the alter ego, for example? Jarred Brown: Great athletes don't hesitate. Okay. Athletes. Second, guess and play within their shell. All of this comes down to breaking fear and boosting confidence James Kemp: You can explain what it is Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: Acquisition offers, and an install offer specifically James Kemp: talks to people who already feel that that is the solution. Right Jarred Brown: Okay. James Kemp: They may not, they may not call it that Jarred Brown: Okay, that's why I might change that. Then I might change the name James Kemp: What we have to think about in offers is what context is created before them. James Kemp: Hmm, 2 point. James Kemp: So if someone is solution aware, they are looking for the solution James Kemp: right? And then they're looking for. Who's going to provide the solution? James Kemp: This is not the place that we would educate someone on what the James Kemp: what the best solution is. Or maybe I just need to train harder. Maybe I need to have a better mindset. These are people are . James Kemp: I need that older ego, and I need to carry it with me, and I need to take it on the field straight away, because James Kemp: I've understood the benefit from that right Jarred Brown: Yeah, the language is probably more Jarred Brown: confidence, so I'll probably make it something the confidence total. Jarred Brown:, I don't think athletes athletes aren't identifying. Don't need an alter ego. They're identifying. Don't I need more confidence James Kemp: You can., you can link those things together. Because if. James Kemp: obviously, Todd's book and those things educated the market a bit a lot on these things

. Jarred Brown:, I don't think athletes athletes aren't identifying. Don't need an alter ego. They're identifying. Don't I need more confidence James Kemp: You can., you can link those things together. Because if. James Kemp: obviously, Todd's book and those things educated the market a bit a lot on these things. There's examples of professional athletes using them James Kemp: so Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: The education and the market doesn't need to come from you. James Kemp: but lots of people know that they need an offer. James Kemp: and I'm not the only one talking about it selling it, or anything that. It's a benefit that the market gets educated towards solutions Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: We don't have a monopoly on most things. We just have a monopoly on on the central idea of how we do it Jarred Brown: Yeah, that's fine. I can test the names, anyway. James Kemp: This is me you James Kemp: so is it an older ego? Jarred Brown: Yeah, the alt. The alter ego is Jarred Brown: the tool that they get. The outcome is confidence in split second moments James Kemp: Yeah, so you could, you could talk to that. There. James Kemp: Our goal is a New year. James Kemp: In 4 weeks you'll have a a new James Kemp: level headed clear-headed., calm under pressure. James Kemp: persona, that you can, that you can activate within 5 min and carry it onto the field every Saturday Jarred Brown: Yep. Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: So again, specificity. And if it isn't an objective thing we can point at money or time or weight, or anything that's objectively measurable. We have the objective experience of what it generates. James Kemp: So you walk you . Describe that person James Kemp: 5 min before the game activating the order ego running onto the field. Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: You feel you're a foot taller and a foot wider, and, a yard faster and etc, etc, you go to town on James Kemp: describing the person they become. James Kemp: Because, yeah, all all personal development stuff is is building a better version of the person in the future. Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: So when I say specificity in that. But you are describing exactly that per the that version of the person in the future Jarred Brown: Yeah, no, I. It's very active right now with Nico. So that's okay. I can break his his experience down, because we're Jarred Brown: been speaking about before performance in performance, post performance, and the intricacies of that. So that's sweet James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: So understand, over 4 weeks we install. James Kemp: So you'd you'd put the pros that you work with. There Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: Your alter ego that you can. James Kemp: what are they going to do?, it sounds a schizophrenic, carrying around an alter ego with them, but Jarred Brown: Forward to 10 scenario 4 weeks. We install your Alta Edo. Jarred Brown: Are you trying to move? But that you can use before the weekend's performance, are you? Is that what you're going at here? Is it? James Kemp: And you can turn on at will. Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: I think people don't know what at well means. You can turn on when you need. James Kemp: It's a hymn right Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: And then that would be the description of that Jarred Brown: The mechanism
