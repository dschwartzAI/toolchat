# New Transcripts James - Part 8

. Yeah. I think we, we have, we have slightly different philosophies in terms of maybe front end products and those strategic moves, right? And it's interesting to me of a hundred percent of the people who have joined me in, in in Q1, consume something. Yep. 90% consume something through the, through buying something and making the commitment an investment, whether it's $9 or a hundred dollars or $999, it didn't really matter. They got in, they consumed something, they got an insight, and then they took the next step, Right? Did other 10% consume something as well? They just did it over a really long time. they watched a lot of stuff. They wa they read a book, they watched a lot of videos, they stalked me across multiple platforms and consumed something, but they just did it in a much more, what we call organic way, Right? 'cause you're not just referring to just paid, but obviously it includes paid, It may, well in, in the cases of the 10%, it doesn't include paid, they didn't buy a single thing until they became a client. Right. But other people bought in some cases one or multiple products. But the theme is consumption. And I notice people getting really stuck on ads versus organic. Mm-hmm. And the commonality between both of them is that if you create a place in an environment where people can consume your ideas, then something, something will happen. Right? Right. Rather than worrying too much as our ads best are, again, 'cause we've got examples of both working. Right. Right. And, and this is where I think it's useful to go back to the, what is innately natural to you, right? If you can produce content every day that's super targeted, that's right on point. And, you can be super consistent with that over long periods of time, then pursuing an organic content route makes a lot of sense because you're just gonna produce it. People will consume it, and eventually someone will do something. Take the next step, reach out. Yeah. Become a cut. If you are, if you're not consistent with that, that you, that you run in sparks of inspiration that you, that you, beaver away for two weeks in a, in a room somewhere and you make a product and you're, and then you're really proud of it and you put it out there, then choosing a strategy that compliments that makes the most sense because both of them get consumption, right? Mm-hmm. And I notice a lot of people try and straddle these two worlds where they, they try and simplify it to organic ads, right? Do I do organic ads? And I think it's, it's more useful to how do, what can you be consistent at producing? And then what, how do, how do, how do how, what is the optimal way for people to consume that? And then the answer is at the end of that chain, because there's some very, very convincing people who are gonna tell you that organic is the best way to grow your business because they Yeah. This is so relative. what are you optimizing for? It's Extremely relative, but it's the, the consistency is where the, where the, where it comes out. I, I talked to a mutual friend yesterday and I was, how's the, the, the mastermind going? And he is, oh yeah, two people joined. One of them, has been following me for two years and the other one for three. And I talked about someone who came to Bali a while ago and who hadn't bought a single thing off me but started following me four years ago. Right? Right

. I, I talked to a mutual friend yesterday and I was, how's the, the, the mastermind going? And he is, oh yeah, two people joined. One of them, has been following me for two years and the other one for three. And I talked about someone who came to Bali a while ago and who hadn't bought a single thing off me but started following me four years ago. Right? Right. And it's, what can you be consistent at and how do you, how do you produce? We have to produce something to put out into the world, but how do you produce, I think, then dictates how you show up and what strategies you use rather than trying to be an imitation of somebody else., it'd be crazy to try and do daily email me if you haven't written every day for half your life, right. When people weren't reading it or weren't watching I was writing. And so by choosing and discerning what you are consistent at and what you can do for a long time, I think, I think forms the choices you make in terms of the strategy because then you then at the end of that, that's amplifying. Yeah. Yeah. I'll, I'll piggyback on that 'cause I think that's really connected to one of the biggest lessons that I've, I've, been thinking about and, and feeling. And you said something that's interesting and I want to challenge it, but you probably will agree as well, which you said, our philosophies on front end products are different, but my philosophy is this, if I did what you did, I'd make more money if I combine that with what I was doing. Right?, moving people to workshops, running workshops regularly, making office consistently, all that totally works. So, so, so philosophy wise, alignment. However, I would sooner want to punch myself in the face than write daily emails. Hmm. And so this is the key thing that I keep thinking about is, it is that true aspect of, everything works and we have to find the thing that feels, what's that saying? It's the thing that feels play to you but looks work to others. Yeah. So I feel that around video, right? I feel really, really light around content creation when I, if I'm allowed to create whatever I want to create, and it just so happens I want to create really often. But if I held myself to a standard, if I have a content calendar and today is, today is pain 0.371, why sales calls, suck., I would, I would quit this business because it feels the business would be telling me what to do. That sounds horrible. And I think there's this really deep sense of something more going on with models where we can talk about it on a surface level perspective of what works or what seems effective. And so, we'll take this for example. Everyone here should have a focus of having something that someone can consume before they get to your offer or your pitch or your sales conversation. You'll make more money the more of your stuff that people consume, right? That's, that's my core, belief around that. However, it has, the way you do it has to feel light to you. And I think, and I'll be interested to know what you think and have observed with this, James. I think there's this whole conversation around the nervous system that most of us are not having, which is that most of us choose models that, that we are choosing because it is the most effective way, right? This is the best funnel of 2025. The problem is, is that it leaves us feeling disregulated, misaligned, everything feels heavy. We feel we are constantly stuck in first gear, can't get momentum because that isn't how we're wired. That isn't what we are here to do

. The problem is, is that it leaves us feeling disregulated, misaligned, everything feels heavy. We feel we are constantly stuck in first gear, can't get momentum because that isn't how we're wired. That isn't what we are here to do. If you are a more creative type, there are so many business models that will absolutely crush you because it'll be, cool, just fill out your numbers 37 times a day and find out what the bottleneck is in the funnel. Where when people ask me what my numbers are, I'm, I have no idea. I get, I get a message from my VA once a week just giving me the summary of something and I barely even look at it. For me, it's much more intuitive. It's more about feeling, it's more about how much I'm enjoying the business. People will ask me, Hey, what you are doing this wait list thing?, is this more effective than this? And I'm, please don't copy me. 'cause I don't care how many clients I get, I'm just optimizing for fun. Talk to me about what you've observed with this, with your own journey coming into this year and the start of this year around this whole idea of, I'm putting words in your mouth, but nervous system, the thing below the thing where it's not this strategy works or this strategy works tuning into what feels best for you. Yeah. I, I make the most money when I'm have the most constraints and said another way I make the most money when I work the least, right? Because the, the non negotiables of I'm gonna turn up on calls three times a week are in, and everything else is, is is vibe in terms of optional. And so that, that the white space enhances the creativity. The creativity. If it's natural and innate and it's emerging, then it's fun. And the more fun it is, the more it's consumed and the more it's consumed, the more people are attracted to it. And the more people are attracted to it, the more people buy stuff. Yeah. Right. There's a question there. What if it feels light? But Maybe I saw that. I was, we gotta go after this Question. it's, i semantics matter a lot and discernment is, def is defining things for yourself and effective is not what James says or what Dan says. It's what is effective for you and what does the, the, the business should serve you. Right? And if it serves you, then it's effective. If it serves you, it probably serves others. And the internet allows us to find who the others are. And this is the, the inversion of the idea of that I, I think the assumption is effective means it makes money, Right? Whereas making money is a byproduct of value creation. And value creation as a byproduct of values and values are a byproduct of alignment of you being aligned with the thing that you're making and then the then this, then it comes at the end. Mm-hmm. Whereas the inversion that most people have is, I'm doing this because it makes money. And so the tightness is the only effective measure is money. Why do I hate it? Well, the the question answers itself because the only effective measure is money, but no value is being created because you don't value it. I'm just closing my window because the boys are just hopping on the trampoline., I think this is a huge lesson because I believe that the worst version of yourself that you can give anyone else is the one of you that's living under obligation. So I want you to really think about this from a pragmatic standpoint for everyone on this call. You follow James and you go, I'm gonna write a daily email because that's what he tells me to do

. I'm just closing my window because the boys are just hopping on the trampoline., I think this is a huge lesson because I believe that the worst version of yourself that you can give anyone else is the one of you that's living under obligation. So I want you to really think about this from a pragmatic standpoint for everyone on this call. You follow James and you go, I'm gonna write a daily email because that's what he tells me to do. And so, four days outta the week, you feel you've got some juice and some flow, and three days outta the week, you feel you're dragging yourself to your computer going, I need to keep this cadence going, or I'm gonna be poor. Right? Or you follow me and you go, I need to create a video sales or whatever else. The worst version of you that anyone's gonna get, clients, potential clients, your friends, your family, is one in that's, is living under the heavy weight of obligation. And so what you have to really understand is, is if you constantly serve the, the goal and the north star of, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to increase revenue, you have become money's b***h. Do you feel, Do you Feel, do you feel responsible I do for creating this though? What do you mean? 'cause we talk, we talk about, okay, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna project, I talk about making this much money per year, per month, per week and per day. And I am getting people to focus on how much money you can make in very short time periods. Right? Yeah. why? Because in marketing it f*****g works. Yeah. Because that's, that's, most people survive Me. I want that. Yeah. And the problem is it works. The problem is people respond to it. And so therefore they go, I, I want that. And then we go, okay, you can have that. And this is what you measure it on. Not how it feels. He's gone. I called him out so badly about being a marketer that he just left. No, I think the, the short term metrics, I I, I've oppressed myself under the weight of those for years and years., I wanna, I I I tell stories about, when I joined, Sam Ovens program and Andrew argued made the first a hundred K month, and I was, f*****g al imagine making a hundred thousand dollars a month. And so these metrics get very, these metrics get very short term where we start to think and look at the only thing that matters is how ma what happens on that particular day or week or month. So I, I'm back by the way, I have no idea what the hell just happened to my computer, but zoom just disappeared., I was the, I I said to everybody, it was 'cause I called you out about being a marketer and you just left in a half. I Didn't pay my wifi bill is the truth. It's too expensive over Here. You're broke. The truth is coming up. Sorry, I did miss the last part of the conversation. I heard you say you're not projecting and then we obviously talk about money a lot. IIII think we talk about, I think we talk about short term metrics a lot to the detriment of how someone's, how someone's feeling and existing in that, in that short, in the short term. Yeah. How does your business and how does, how do you are interacting with your clients and how does making this content feel today? Not what does the Stripe balance say? Correct. 'cause the perversity is, the more you optimize for that, the more the strike balance goes up. Yep. And the more you, the less you look at it, the more it goes up. Correct

. Yeah. How does your business and how does, how do you are interacting with your clients and how does making this content feel today? Not what does the Stripe balance say? Correct. 'cause the perversity is, the more you optimize for that, the more the strike balance goes up. Yep. And the more you, the less you look at it, the more it goes up. Correct. I have no idea how much money I've made the last few months. All I know is that I've made money. I don't track any of it. I also don't have stripe, which if I had stripe, I'd probably know. But I have some really ghetto, for people for, for, for bro scalers who got banned by Stripe., how I think about it, I don't know if this is the right way. I might become more enlightened in my older years and went, man, I was so off track with this. How I think about it personally is I I, my value around this is the Trojan horse, right? I talk about money 'cause that it seems to be where most people struggle. And I've developed a bit of a knack of how to make it. And if I can help people make it and get them out of survival, it allows me to talk about the things that are more important. Nothing's more fulfilling to me than helping someone make a lot of money for them to realize that money was never the thing that we're trying to look for anyway. So that's how I think about it, is that if I was to share what I really believe, and that's not to say that I'm being inauthentic, but if I was to really go out and be, guys, money's just not that important. Firstly, most people wouldn't listen. They'd be, cool, easy for you to say onto the next, you rich guy, person. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. But the second thing is, is that, I wanna meet people where they're at. And so there's this really big tension that I, I'm not saying I've nailed by any means, but how I think about it, if you think if, if you were to interview any one of my clients, I imagine it's similar in your world. People come in., the more I talk about this stuff publicly around not just money, intuition, the energetic, attractive piece of who you are. If people come into my world, there's obviously an emphasis on, let's fix your broken funnel. Let's, let's make your offer better. Let's help you make some money. But it much faster becomes around, what life do you wanna live? Who do you want to be? Let's let's move you closer to a calendar. You have romantic feelings towards because of our beautiful looks, and much much further away from just the money piece. So I think it's an interesting nuance and I definitely don't have the answer to it, but one of the things I will say is that I hope that both of us model a world in which we are happy to leave money on the table. And that money for neither of us is our true north star. That while neither of us wanna go back to being, broke minded and broke ba broke, broke bank accounts, I would absolutely take a much lower paying version of this business if I was able to still be the person I am now still feel the way that I feel, still have the level of freedom that I have in terms of my time., so there's nuances there, but I hope that we are at least doing our best to try and model. And I think for everyone here on this call, modeling is infinitely more important than, than what you say through content. The life you live is going to outspeak any words that ever leave your mouth

., so there's nuances there, but I hope that we are at least doing our best to try and model. And I think for everyone here on this call, modeling is infinitely more important than, than what you say through content. The life you live is going to outspeak any words that ever leave your mouth. And I think that awareness around leadership and market, why you and I are able to attract the people that we attract, I think it has so much more to do with who we are than what we say. Anyway, I'm, I could get off track on this, but I think, I think, I think that's a hundred percent true. And I think, there's a good question there because it's the, it is the, the the, the problem of the ages., how do you get out of the money scarcity mindset? And honestly the answer is, the answer is nuance. But it's, just figure out what it is you need to live on. the, I feel you can either have philosophical questions with someone who can't pay rent next week, or you can just figure out the fastest way to pay rent and then change the conversation. And now how do I do this in a lighter funnel way? I, Yeah. For me, for me, the answer's twofold For me. The, the, the pursuit of money was I had to mind the fear about what I was trying to run away from. And the pursuit of the, my pursuit of money was, was a was, and still is occasionally was through the, running away from the fear of abandonment because I felt that if I had money and I was, and I had a metric that showed I was useful to people, I was less likely to be abandoned. Right. And so the, the root, the root driver that caused me to do the work that I did and do the work to, to enable the skills to build the resources I've got now was me trying to run away from the potential of abandonment. Right. That I would be alone, that I would be unloved, that I would be, not good enough. Yeah. And so the, the money I saw as a shield mm hmm. And so I think most people have a pursuit of money to try to get away from something else. Yeah. And if what the something else is, then you can simultaneously rationally build wealth and money. Mm-hmm. Because it's quite useful and quite important and our society, but also deal with the underlying fear because fear is, is, our number one governor and the, the other, the other piece of that is vision, right? Money, human humans hate uncertainty. And so people who have a very vivid vision for the future, for the world that we are going to inhabit, that I'm gonna inhabit, that you are gonna inhabit people who have a vivid, clear vision of what the future looks, have attention and subsequently wealth flow to them when people buy into that vision. Yeah. And so the actions to the act, the, the simple actions to take today, not easy ones, mind the fear of what you, you what, what are you chasing and what are you, what are you running away from? Yeah. And that fear, what is the, what is your vision of the future that you are gonna step into and potentially invite other people along? 'cause that's what I see. I do. I just form a, an idea of a future that someone that I wanna live and, and, and, and trust that other people are gonna wanna live that too. Yeah. And then, and then, what, what, what financial needs do I have that I need to meet in terms of obligations and rationally take actions that meet those. you say, if you've gotta pay rent, go and get some f*****g money to pay the rent
