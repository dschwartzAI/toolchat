# James 3K Code Transcript - Part 2

. James Kemp: and we see this all the time. That direct, that getting away from the core and talking about all the benefits. James Kemp: confuses you and confuses the market. Right? So personally, I solve for making money. James Kemp: and the stem of that is from one of my core beliefs that true freedom is downstream from from financial freedom. James Kemp: So the core piece about me and my orientation towards the market is making money. James Kemp: All the benefits come around that James Kemp: because the benefits that come along with working with me and the way I make it, and the philosophy James Kemp: they keep people around, but they are attracted to the core idea of making money first, which stems from the core belief that true freedom is downstream for financial freedom. James Kemp: So to understand and define your core. James Kemp: you need to go a layer deeper on yourself and say, What do you belief? What are some of the core beliefs that you build from. James Kemp: because most people try and build from all their core beliefs, and then just assemble this confusing piece of, well, what do you stand for? James Kemp: But when you have a core James Kemp: promise and a core orientation towards the market. James Kemp: and you solve for one core. James Kemp: it's a massive, massive shortcut in terms of the clarity that the market receives you. So the benefits are there. But you solve for one core James Kemp: so validating your market, and these are these are not a test, they are an exercise and understanding. If you go through this and you are blocked and unable to do this, then it's an indicator that there is confusion inside you that bleeds out into the market. James Kemp: So which one of these 4 things are you solving for for your customer? James Kemp: What is the main problem you are solving? James Kemp: How does this problem show up in people's lives? Are they even aware that that problem exists? And in what way are people trying to solve this problem? Now. James Kemp: again, it's an exercise. If you can't define this or you are blocked and doing it, then it's an indicator that you have multiple things going on, that you're trying to be all things to all people in the marketplace. James Kemp: You can be all things. James Kemp: But you must choose one core at a time, as you orientate towards the market, and your core piece can evolve and change. James Kemp: and it does naturally. James Kemp: But there must be a core there, otherwise you will be confused, and if you are confused the market is confused. James Kemp: So James Kemp: that's the piece that takes some time as well, because that's a distillation piece. So you must strip back to James Kemp: for call for reasons. James Kemp: what's your core. James Kemp: So when we approach a product and offer. James Kemp: we must be clear on what we do for others, and how. And this is a useful distinction. I'm using the word consulting here in a one on one context. James Kemp: But the modalities are important, and the fixation on the identity of this labels distorts value creation. James Kemp: so, seeing them as simple modalities, allows the creativity to match the principles. So these are my definitions, coaching, helping people discover the answer inside them. James Kemp: Coaches help integrate James Kemp: consulting, giving people the answer. James Kemp: consultants help execute mentorship showing someone how I would do it. And James Kemp: this is what I put into practice just for some context here. And this is a demonstration. Again. James Kemp: I create from my community. I coach on the weekly calls I consult on Slack, and I mentor on Zoom

. So these are my definitions, coaching, helping people discover the answer inside them. James Kemp: Coaches help integrate James Kemp: consulting, giving people the answer. James Kemp: consultants help execute mentorship showing someone how I would do it. And James Kemp: this is what I put into practice just for some context here. And this is a demonstration. Again. James Kemp: I create from my community. I coach on the weekly calls I consult on Slack, and I mentor on Zoom. James Kemp: and I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit. James Kemp: and you can sell each modality individually, or bundle, bundle them together into products. James Kemp: So there was a snapshot of James Kemp: what my stack looked . Recently I have the syndicate I have slack coaching on top. I have zoom mentorship. You can buy consulting hours. I have deep dives that are virtual or in person. James Kemp: And I'm showing you the potential. James Kemp: I'm demonstrating this as the model right. But we are going to use the simplest stack with 2 products. To start James Kemp: right, we're going to have a community, and we're going to have a consulting product on top. James Kemp: If you want to call the consulting coaching. That is fine. I won't get in. I will argue semantics all day long, but I won't get into the semantics here because I'm just going to give you the way to do it rather than getting to quote app and and what it is. James Kemp: So these stack, in the sense that a consulting client gets the community product included. James Kemp: And the construction of product is simply this. what's in it? And how long is it right? So delivery has 3 components, it has content. It has community and customization. James Kemp: So under the hybrid model, we provide everything someone needs to get the promised result. And the simplest model looks this. This is what you should have. and your product James Kemp: and your 2 products. James Kemp: a training portal. So that's James Kemp: how to do stuff training templates anything they need to get the promised result. James Kemp: a community I use school. You can use Facebook groups James Kemp: genuinely, don't care. Just have a community for your people that gets together, and a low friction way for them to be supported and be together. James Kemp: The tier one community offer you have at least one group call and the syndicate we have 2, James Kemp: and on your tier 2 consulting offer you have one on one calls James Kemp: again. I'm giving you the prescription. This is the simple way to do it. James Kemp: If you wish to go fast. If people who wish to go faster or have a high level of access off for tier 2, or getting everything in tier one. James Kemp: and you include only what is required to get them. The core result. So there are some permitted changes for delivering. you can introduce, done for you components which many of you do. James Kemp: your existing coaching program or packages of hours. We have a couple of people here super successfully selling 100 community offer. James Kemp: and then selling bundles of our hours over and above, and making thousands of dollars a month to selling their time, or having an easy offer to sell to the marketplace is very scalable. so the only key James Kemp: is to have a product that allows for higher client value over and above the community level, because the community level is relatively constrained., we can make 100 to 150 to $200 a week in terms of total client value, and $3,000 a year if we're doing a pay and full option for that. So it's relatively constrained

. so the only key James Kemp: is to have a product that allows for higher client value over and above the community level, because the community level is relatively constrained., we can make 100 to 150 to $200 a week in terms of total client value, and $3,000 a year if we're doing a pay and full option for that. So it's relatively constrained. So we must find those people to expand their economics. James Kemp: and the people who are higher up the power law ladder, who want to go faster. Some people just want one on one help and customization. James Kemp: The second piece with the product is, how long is it? James Kemp: Again, being prescriptive? Your community offer is 12 months. James Kemp: Okay, so we get to the nuance of how to sell this. But the plan allows us to maximize lifetime value on a path pathway that makes sense to the prospect. James Kemp: So that's the product piece. James Kemp: And a lot of people labor this and get caught up. And I need to include a lot of stuff James Kemp: most products James Kemp: die. James Kemp: Add indigestion they're just hard to consume, and there's too much stuff in them. And that's James Kemp: I've kept that simple on purpose, and that's the that's again, the part that people want to add complexity to, because they think they should include a lot of stuff. Or they look at other people, including a lot of stuff James Kemp: when all you need is content, community and customisation. James Kemp: So that's the product. And the offer is the wrapper around it. James Kemp: So the promise and the plan drive the offer. James Kemp: The offer lives and dies on the first page. And when we get to the Google Doc and some examples James Kemp: it desired, it lives and dies in the first 3 paragraphs. James Kemp: So if you get these right, the offer sells itself James Kemp: clearly, articulating the promise of what gets done, and the plan of how it rolls out allows people to see the future before they commit to buying. James Kemp: This is very distinct of the logistics of how and when everything is delivered what's in it. No one really cares how many calls there are, or how much coaching they get until they're committed to the result. James Kemp: Right? That is pure logistics, and many offers and products are just jammed up with all the stuff James Kemp: that's in them. James Kemp: So match this to the right price, and you are 80% there and having a high converting offer. James Kemp: One of the James Kemp: secrets that how I get fast results with people is distilling down into that first page of the offer. James Kemp: You have a great offer. James Kemp: and, up to 10 million dollars. Now the business is the offer. That is, the may drive a performance. So I'm distilling down the primary things that make a high performing profitable business. James Kemp: So James Kemp: what gets done? James Kemp: And again, this is a important exercise. James Kemp: What gets done? What can you point at? Can you describe what they will see? Show up in their lives if they commit to working with you? Can you articulate in words their deepest desires even better than they can? James Kemp: What aren't they going to do, and what negative downsides? Are you helping them avoid? James Kemp: So what's the plan? What happens first? What happens next? What happens after that? James Kemp: Have you painted a clear picture James Kemp: of how the next few days and weeks look, and what they will see show up. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems

. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems. But don't go over the top. James Kemp: and with pricing is there a clear roi? Have you made it easy to get started? And I've done that by giving you the prescriptions of the pricing? James Kemp: And does your price factor in the cost of inaction? Have you just made it really easy to get started as the primary model? And again. this. I'm laboring this because it's a massive failure point. James Kemp: No one wants to watch 54 videos and intend 10 h of calls a week the better the client, and, the more money they have, the less time they have James Kemp: right, because more offers fail because they are indigestible rather than Lane James Kemp: telling people what's in it., all the things they get is more likely to kill demand than enhance it. Again, it's a common failure point that I see in products and offers that people are talking about all the stuff they get. James Kemp: and in and a desire to overwhelm them with value. James Kemp: And it's lazy, because if you have a clear promise and a plan, people don't need to know all the value you you deliver, they just need to get, be clear about it, so they can say yes and get started. James Kemp: So is to get some examples to bring these things together. Your next task is to construct an offer using a simple Google Doc James Kemp: syndicate folks, 95% of you should have one right now. So the reason we use a Google Doc as far as it's fast to create James Kemp: and to share and to modify. And it's most useful to demonstrate James Kemp: by examples. And I've got a template for you here as well. James Kemp: so this is an example from Jason and Janine. James Kemp: and it talks clearly about the promise James Kemp: and the plan. So the promise is. James Kemp: do you want support for me, and my incredible, incredible community can install a system that can can James Kemp: consistently attracts 5 prospects every month, securing at least one high value client every single month on your terms with the visibility you deserve, and without becoming stuck in the frustration of being the best kept secret. James Kemp: so clearly, clearly, clearly articulates what happens right? It uses numbers. It uses currency to clearly say. James Kemp: this is what's going to happen. This is what you get, and these are things you can point at James Kemp: it clearly, says that it's a 12 month program. but then it comes into over the next 6 weeks. James Kemp: and it talks about the plan will develop your client roadmap so you can. So you are faster. James Kemp: So your laser focused on who you work with. And more importantly, they'll want to work with you right? James Kemp: Then we install your product roadmap James Kemp: very clear. No cuteness. Just the client roadmap, the product roadmap, and then the IP generator system. James Kemp: So it's a great example James Kemp: of being very, very clear about the promise and the plan. and again distilling it down and removing any superfluous bits around the core. Right? Everything else in there is a benefit James Kemp: but the core James Kemp: clearly clearly articulated in the promise as something desirable, and the plan that future paces people to go through. James Kemp: This is what sales offers. James Kemp: If someone is clear that those are the things they want, and they agree with the plan. James Kemp: they are very, very, very likely to want to get started when the price meets the expectation. James Kemp: and again the pricing I've given you, will meet the expectation

. James Kemp: This is what sales offers. James Kemp: If someone is clear that those are the things they want, and they agree with the plan. James Kemp: they are very, very, very likely to want to get started when the price meets the expectation. James Kemp: and again the pricing I've given you, will meet the expectation. James Kemp: So the syndicate, another example. Might, remember, I James Kemp: say, what I teach, what I do and do what I teach. James Kemp: So 32% of the people who see the sender get buy it. James Kemp: The James Kemp: average client value is 121 above the 121% above the entry price. James Kemp: That's why we stack offers the it's almost 50% of people in the syndicate who join James Kemp: by consulting hours from me. James Kemp: A dozen people have joined the sovereign circle, which is, triple the price. Thanks. In triple the price of the Syndicate. James Kemp: We've had 8 people come to Bali, 8 more in January. James Kemp: 6 people have got deep dives, either, in person or in zoom and come. So there are lots of people who are upgraded using the stack and the variant that I run. James Kemp: But I'm giving you the simplest one. So the syndicate James Kemp: is specific about what it does. James Kemp: Again, the promises get him off as pumping out cash with having me crank to the handle myself. James Kemp: Our goal is building a million dollar sovereign, consulting business with 50 clients or less, with just 3 days a week per per week on the tools. James Kemp: Then I lay the plan out right. James Kemp: Everything else is the logistics. and how it unfolds. So James Kemp: over and over again, if we have the correct promise, and we have the plan that is clearly articulated, then that is what sells the offer James Kemp: I have. I offer template for you here today. Make a copy for yourself. James Kemp: and I break down exactly where each of those stases are. So the promise, the plan. James Kemp: and then the phases as I feature, paste them and the price. James Kemp: So when you have those things clearly articulated, and that is the work to do. James Kemp: then your offer converts. James Kemp: So James Kemp: after this, we need to construct to construct offers. James Kemp: But at implementation point. James Kemp: are you clear about your core? It's really important. You get clear about the core? James Kemp: Have you decided what content community and customization to include? James Kemp: Again, I've given you the simplest prescription. Does your offer have a promised plan and price with a clear Roi. James Kemp: that checklist there is going to get you closer to a million dollars than anything else. Right? James Kemp: You could have all the leads in the world, and the best sales patterr than on earth. James Kemp: But if you're clear about those things, that is the needle mover James Kemp: in an offer driven business. That is where the leverages. James Kemp: because you are very, very clear about James Kemp: the core. Reason that you orientate yourself towards the market. James Kemp: You're very, very clear about what you deliver. So it's very scalable, and scalability is in delivery, not in the sales and marketing. James Kemp: And does your offer have a promise to plan and a price with a clear Roi! James Kemp: So skipping ahead, of course, you've just all written a Google Doc offer in the last 37 min. James Kemp: and now you have a first draft of an offer inside there

. James Kemp: You're very, very clear about what you deliver. So it's very scalable, and scalability is in delivery, not in the sales and marketing. James Kemp: And does your offer have a promise to plan and a price with a clear Roi! James Kemp: So skipping ahead, of course, you've just all written a Google Doc offer in the last 37 min. James Kemp: and now you have a first draft of an offer inside there. James Kemp: So your goal should I correct the grammar as I go along? Or is that word. Your goal is to get that offer in front of 10 people and validate it with 3 sales. James Kemp: So during this time you'll be listening intently to feedback from prospects. The validation phase is about learning that outcome that we want in terms of validation of sales. James Kemp: but the learning is where people say no when they have objections where they have questions, and for to update the offer. James Kemp: because it's dynamic again. every time I open the syndicate there's probably one or 2 small tweaks James Kemp: that offer. So even though I've sold it hundreds of times in different iterations. James Kemp: I'm always tweaking the offer to get more clarity into it right so to validate. Audit your audience assets. James Kemp: I do not want to hear that people don't have an audience. James Kemp: Everybody has an audience. They just have different names for it. James Kemp: You have a network, you have a reputation. James Kemp: you have things you have people that you can talk to. that you can validate. So. James Kemp: clients, you haven't closed in the past once to 2 months. Former clients. James Kemp: an email database. So do social media messages, your current advertising partners and networks. James Kemp: 10 people. That's all we want to validate something. James Kemp: If you can think of the first 2 people that you put, a community and consulting offer in front. James Kemp: You're you're a couple of, about 5 min of thinking away from getting to the 10. James Kemp: Everybody has people that they can put office in front of. James Kemp: In a simple way. James Kemp: We send them a simple message. James Kemp: I'm opening the doors for 5 people to work with me to get the promise in James Kemp: the time it takes. James Kemp: I've made it easy to get started for $100 a week. Shall I send you the details? So we use the pricing as a hook. James Kemp: and we start a conversation because the conversation is where it gets the insights. James Kemp: so create a conversation around. The offer is the promise meaningful to them. James Kemp: Getting a no is as good as a yes. because if you get a know with the reasons why. James Kemp: then you get insight into the offer. James Kemp:, this time of year. The no could be a timing. No. James Kemp: no, this is not right now, so it it gets to a next step. James Kemp: No's are just as useful and yes, as in a sales process. because it uncovers the next step. We don't accept maybes because maybes don't lead you to a next step, they just leave you in limbo. James Kemp: So get people to a no James Kemp: right? Is it a timing thing? Is the price thing? Is it a is it a promise thing? Is it a clear? Is it a clear piece. James Kemp: a clarity thing? What makes fun? What questions do they ask James Kemp: again? Clear is kind, clear, is kind to yourself and Clear is kind in office
