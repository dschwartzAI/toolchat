# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 13

I would quickly convert those five people, and I would quickly validate whether that is good or bad for me, and good or bad for them. But it's only through the doing that those things are validated in terms of where people see value, what they'll buy into, and ultimately, what behavior that they lead to next. ## Concurrent Campaigns: Maximizing Market Economics and Utility **Summary:** James explains how bundling and unbundling allows for running concurrent campaigns, targeting both external and internal markets with different offers. He prioritizes internal offers for existing community members, providing them with preferential pricing and access to exclusive opportunities. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Bundling and unbundling allows us to have multiple offers at once. I can have two concurrent campaigns running at once, so I can be on the outside selling one thing and on the inside selling another thing. You notice over the past few weeks I've opened up various opportunities. I opened up the Circle to people who are in the Syndicate first before I went to the marketplace. I opened up the Blueprint dates to people who are in the Syndicate first before I went to the marketplace. I will, at the moment, exclusively sell one-on-one hours to people who are in the community, rather than selling them to people on my list because there's a higher value proposition and a higher rate of return. I can also discount those things safely in a closed environment. I don't want to go above the line and discount my hours to people who don't know me and don't have a perceived value of that, because all they see is the discount. ## Maintaining Price Integrity and Maximizing Internal Demand **Summary:** James discusses the strategy of offering discounted pricing to existing community members while maintaining a higher market rate for external clients. This approach allows for maximizing internal demand and prevents sending signals to the market that could devalue his premium offerings. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** While my outside market rate is still $5,000, I reduce that significantly for people who are already in that world. This allows me to bundle and unbundle, but also safely price something. I'm not sending a signal to the market. If you are discounting things on a regular basis, then you can be sending signals to the market where ultimately that becomes your fixed daily rate, and I still have people paying $5,000. So I want to make sure that I can maintain the integrity of that. A cycle that I'm going through now is the Syndicate, opening up the Circle, the Blueprint, and then selling the workshops internally. Then I'm going through a different promotion cycle where I've opened up one-on-one hours, opened up the Blueprint for the dates, and ensured that people who are already in the Syndicate or in the community can have a pay plan on the Blueprint. I've got three VIPs booked, and I'll offer those internally first. By taking these goggles, I can have two different things for sale at once, which maximizes the market and economics, but also maximizes the utility. People have been reaching out to me saying, "When are you going to open hours?" So there was already demand there internally that I could tap. ## Minimizing Complexity for Scalability and Growth **Summary:** James emphasizes the importance of minimizing complexity in business for scalability and growth. He explains that too much variation in delivery creates complexity, making it difficult to scale and hindering the development of a solid value proposition. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** We're looking at reducing complexity. All of the things that I am showing you are things that I'm doing and things that I can scale. I'm prepared to do a segment of hours every few months

. He explains that too much variation in delivery creates complexity, making it difficult to scale and hindering the development of a solid value proposition. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** We're looking at reducing complexity. All of the things that I am showing you are things that I'm doing and things that I can scale. I'm prepared to do a segment of hours every few months. Is it maximally scalable? No, it's not, because I limit the number of one-on-one hours that I have available. The minimizing complexity piece is the piece where most people fall over with this because they start creating rather than unbundling. The more variation we have in delivery, the more complexity we have. If you are doing a lot of different things for different clients at different price points, then you have high complexity. It doesn't matter what your business model is, if you have a lot of variability in delivery, you have a complex business, and complex businesses are hard to scale. They're hard to grow because it's more mental because you don't know what you're offering at any price point. You don't have a solid value proposition. So the more variables you have in your client base, the more complex the business is. If you are doing a small number of things routinely, then you'll have lower complexity. ## Scalability and the Standalone Product Test **Summary:** James explains that the test of a scalable product is whether it can stand on its own and generate significant revenue independently. He uses his own products (one-on-one hours, Blueprint, Circle) as examples of scalable offerings that can each generate six-figure or multiple six-figure incomes. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** The test is in each individual product. If it can stand on its own and scale. For me, the test is, are these individual products a business on their own right? Could I make six or multiple six figures a year out of selling one-on-one hours? Yes. Could I make six or multiple six figures out of selling the Blueprint, by doing the VIP, by just doing the Circle? The answer is yes. So therefore, those things all scale. They scale on the practical level is that I can do them repeatedly, and they scale on the emotional level, as I'm prepared to do them repeatedly. While I'll go through seasons where I'm definitely keen to do one-on-one hours more than I am at other times, they will always be a presence in the business. So by plotting the map of what we have, we have a lot of flexibility. The products are much more dynamic. And then it's up to us: what can we experiment with? What can we go to market with where people will see a value equation that they haven't seen before? ## The Value of a Product Map and Addressing Weaknesses **Summary:** James emphasizes the importance of having a product map to understand the lay of the land in terms of assets and identify weaknesses in production and scalability. He advises pricing products that don't scale accordingly to avoid over-delivering on offerings that demand significant time and energy. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Plenty of people won't see a value equation in the Syndicate. Plenty of people won't see a full value equation in the Circle. I've had conversations with a couple of you, and we decided that the Syndicate was the best place for you right now because you were getting the right level of access to community, the right level of access to me and help. So going up and making the commitment to tripling your investment on a weekly basis doesn't make sense, but that doesn't preclude you from periodically buying hours and access

. Plenty of people won't see a full value equation in the Circle. I've had conversations with a couple of you, and we decided that the Syndicate was the best place for you right now because you were getting the right level of access to community, the right level of access to me and help. So going up and making the commitment to tripling your investment on a weekly basis doesn't make sense, but that doesn't preclude you from periodically buying hours and access. Having a map and having a view of what a product, what an asset is, and ultimately what an offer is, allows us to look at the lay of the land in terms of our assets and the things that we produce, but it also highlights our weaknesses. Are we producing enough in terms of creating assets? It also highlights the weaknesses: are there things that we are doing that we don't want to scale and tolerate? Because if those things are present, then we won't scale them. A number of people, especially in the health and personal development categories, were looking to remove some of the custom elements of their programs because they understood that those things didn't scale. So productizing those pieces, while they're attractive to the market, also, they only have limited scale, so they must be priced accordingly. ## Content-Only Offers and Market Experimentation **Summary:** James discusses the potential of content-only offers as a way to experiment with the market and understand buyer behavior. He considers offering access to all his trainings on a recurring basis without any additional components to see how this impacts buyer cohorts and potential upsells. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** The map is really important to understand those things and then experiment. I will go to the market over the coming months with a content-only offer where it's just,

> "Yeah, have access to all my trainings on a recurring basis,"
 and with nothing else there. What will that do? I don't know. Will it create a whole cohort of buyers? Yes, it will. What will those buyers do? We will see. What behaviors do they undertake? Do people buy my trainings, and then do a portion of those people then buy one-on-one hours over the top, so they skip out the group components? Possibly. Maybe that's happening at the moment where people are bundling together on their own by buying access to some of my content, but also buying one-on-one hours with me, and skipping over the group component that we have in the Syndicate. For them, that value equation is the most efficient at the relative price point. ## Unbundling for Client Empowerment and Flexibility **Summary:** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages. He emphasizes the importance of offering scalable products and being open to how clients choose to combine them, recognizing that different combinations will appeal to different individuals. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Unbundling allows our audience and our clients and our customers to access the value that they see fit, and as long as we are prepared to do it and prepared to offer it because it's scalable to us, then they can assemble that for us with low complexity. I don't have a preference for what 90% of people buy off me until I do have a preference in terms of, I can help advise them what's the best path to go in. So that means that by unbundling, I allow people to choose their own adventure and assemble things that I can't see. A training plus a one-on-one component would be highly valuable to one person, but highly risky for someone else because they wouldn't be able to extract the value fast enough relative to where they are. So it comes back to us being able to unbundle, and our clients being able to see the value equation and tip it in their favor. ## Addressing Client Objections and Diagnosing Value Equations **Summary:** James discusses how to handle client objections related to price by diagnosing their individual value equations. He emphasizes asking clients what they're trying to achieve rather than directly addressing their price concerns, as this provides valuable context for understanding their needs. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** As with any sales conversation, you're diagnosing their own value equation. So what do they say? What do they perceive value in? I've purposely avoided upselling and downselling because it's part of a sales process, whereas this is part of a productization process. What you're looking for is them to put the truth on the table as to where they perceive value. And then you've got the option to present how you would deliver against that value. I'll give you two real examples. When I launched the Circle, I said to two people, "You don't need it." One person said, 
> "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it."

> "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it."
 And so I made an offer where they'd have access to the community and the trainings, and one-on-one access to me via WhatsApp at a price that's higher than the Circle, which includes that component. And they perceived more value in that because they don't want to be involved in group stuff. They want training, and they want to be able to message me. At a practical level, I don't seek to apply a solution. I don't say, "What do value in?" etc. I ask them what they're trying to do. Because that doesn't mean anything without context. "Too expensive" for what? You don't know what that means until you ask them and understand what the context means. We should be rigid in our boundaries and flexible in our packaging of those boundaries. ## Ashley's Unbundling Ideas: Nutrition-Only Offer and Executive Consulting **Summary:** Ashley Richmond proposes two unbundling ideas: a nutrition-only offer for clients already working with trainers and a higher-priced consulting offer for executives who prefer individualized guidance. James cautions against adding complexity and encourages leveraging existing components. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** I think with my offer, offering something just nutrition would probably go well, cause a lot of people are working with an in-person trainer, so they don't need fitness, but they do need nutrition. I also think there's room for the people who want less stuff and are willing to pay more. A lot of executives don't want the group aspect at all. They just want me to tell them what to do. So I think there's room for some consulting offer where they get messaging, a roadmap for them. With nutrition, it's a lot of ongoing support. I think that ongoing support would be helpful in a group. So I'd probably start with an audit, make a plan going forward, and maybe weekly check-ins without trying to make it too complicated. Having a chat, whether it was a group or a one-on-one chat, would be helpful. I already have a WhatsApp group, so I could just make an extra channel for them. If you're adding a component, then you're potentially adding complexity. Anything that's even a small amount of complexity in a leverage business can add up to a large amount of complexity, because leverage works always. Leverage works for us, but it also works against us. ## Unbundling by Frame: Removing the Fitness Component **Summary:** Ashley and James discuss unbundling her existing program by removing the fitness component for clients who already have trainers. James points out that this is unbundling by frame, as the underlying components remain the same, and suggests a pricing strategy based on this reframing. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** At your $100 level, they get training and group messaging. I'd be taking out the fitness side, and then probably the rest would stay the same. So they get the modules, which would have fitness stuff in there anyway, and then the group channel as well ============================================================ # SOURCE FILE: all_transcripts_combined_part_8.txt

- ```txt ## Leveraging Group Dynamics for Client Acquisition **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the benefits of incorporating a group element into coaching programs, even in the initial stages. This fosters a sense of community and makes it easier to expand the program by attracting new clients to an established, thriving group. Video Source:* source: Cash.txt **Content:** Having a group element, even if it's just the first iteration, is hugely beneficial. It becomes a thing, and if it's a thing you love, and it's lucrative, then we're much more likely to sell into a thing once we've got it rolling. Because if I've got 4 people doing this, then why not 5? So you're more likely to grow it and make an offer around it. ## Discernment and Setting Limits in Client Work **Summary:** James Kemp advises coaches to exercise discernment and set limits on their time and availability. While one-on-one coaching is valuable, it can lead to burnout if not managed carefully with boundaries and realistic client capacity. Video Source:* source: Cash.txt **Content:** The thing I'll leave you with is discernment. One-on-one and these components are selling time. They are highly valuable and they have a high return. But things that have a high return also have a high cost. The things that have burnt me out the fastest? Lots of time at Zoom, lots of one-on-one, lots of events, lots of availability, and little boundaries. So it does require discernment to deploy these things and place limits on them. We talk limits a lot about just the practical elements of scarcity and deadlines, both to stimulate the market and get a decision, but also to mitigate delivery issues. It's great to sign 15 clients at once, but if you can't onboard all 15 clients in a reasonable amount of time, you're not going to have 15 clients for very long. So use discernment. Go under the limits that you think you can have capacity for. You think you can take 5 one-on-one clients? You think you can do 10 a week? My recommendation is, halve it, because that's the reality of what you can deploy adequately. Sure, if times are tough and you need some cash flow, then maybe you do need to sell every hour that God gave you to get back on track. There is a time and a place for those things, for doing things we've all done things that maybe didn't necessarily want to do to stay in the game. ## The Power of Simplicity and Sustainable Growth **Summary:** James Kemp highlights the importance of simple, yet powerful strategies for client acquisition and retention. He stresses sustainable growth within one's capacity, avoiding overextension that could hinder future progress. Video Source:* source: Cash.txt **Content:** Use discernment when you're deploying these things, then their power is in their simplicity. But their power is also that they're putting you in a place to move forward rather than maybe limit the next step that you can make as well. ## Event Follow up and Content Distribution **Summary:** James Kemp addresses inquiries about an event, prioritizing existing syndicate members. He also discusses plans for distributing the recording, promising to edit out unnecessary parts before sharing it with the syndicate. Video Source:* source: Cash.txt **Content:** A couple of people messaged me about the event privately. I give syndicate folks first dibs on those. I only put the date up yesterday, so I'll release those probably in a week or so, more publicly, after I've got some more folks in the syndicate. Thank you very much. We'll get the recording out later. We'll edit the bullshit at the beginning and the rambling at the end, and we'll get it out to you

.txt **Content:** A couple of people messaged me about the event privately. I give syndicate folks first dibs on those. I only put the date up yesterday, so I'll release those probably in a week or so, more publicly, after I've got some more folks in the syndicate. Thank you very much. We'll get the recording out later. We'll edit the bullshit at the beginning and the rambling at the end, and we'll get it out to you. Our syndicate people will be in the piece, and I guess I'll be in the, we'll host it on the page, but we'll drop you an email when it's ready. ## Content Creation for Meaningful Conversations **Summary:** James Kemp introduces his approach to content creation, emphasizing its role in sparking conversations that lead to sales. He defines content broadly as any creation designed to communicate a message, prioritizing communication skills over platform-specific strategies. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** So welcome, squad, welcome to our guests as well. If this is your first time, welcome. We've got a Google Doc, it will be, I just had 10 other people join since then, so it will be in the shared with the replay both inside the classroom and also, I guess you'll get a copy of the replay and resources. So, content. To set the scene, I'm going to talk about content in general terms. I get specific in terms of platforms and these different, even mediums. But when I talk about content, I'm talking about the creation of something to convey, to communicate and convey a message. So when I talk about content, you'll understand that philosophy as I go along. I'm not starting from the point of, this is content for Facebook, this is content for email, this is content for YouTube, or whatever. The origin point of content is communication, and knowing how to communicate and what to communicate is the 80/20 factor. So when I talk about content, I talk about it in the macro, and obviously the examples I show you through this are in the micro. They live out in the world, whether it's email or Facebook or Instagram or other places. Content makes money, and content is the most democratized form of leverage that there is. You do not need money to create content. For many other forms of leverage in the world, you need existing resources to have any advantage in deploying leverage. Content is not that. It is fully democratized. The flip side of that is, it's fully competitive. The demands on our attention have never been greater, because there's never been more content. And to be clear, I create content to create conversations. I make money from conversations. I don't make money from making an offer. I make money from understanding what somebody wants and having a solution to that, and then delivering on that solution. But I've made friends, connected with people, made millions of dollars from content. But unless I see something back from it, unless I see over the long term, I wouldn't be participating in making content. And just to, in terms of, to understand that, I write for myself more than I write for other people to communicate. So I have millions more words in different places that are writing to me, which is my thinking that I don't communicate with other people. I just communicate with other people to generate conversations so I can be useful to them. ## The Importance of Practice and Distilling Success Factors **Summary:** James Kemp acknowledges the difficulty of teaching content creation due to his own unconscious competence. He emphasizes the importance of practice and aims to distill his success factors into actionable steps for his audience. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** I will admit something: this is very difficult for me to teach because I've been doing it for so long
