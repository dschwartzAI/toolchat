# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 11

. This "more of the same" approach caters to different consumption preferences and maximizes the value offered within the funnel. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** when I asked Chris yesterday, I'm, What's the what's the message about the book funnel ? What's the how should people think about it? He said. Something that's, very simple in terms of its concept, which is more of the same. If someone is buying the book. Then they are interested in the concept of the book and the problems it solves and the solutions it ultimately has. So what do you put on the in the funnel? You put more of that in there. Right you go deeper, you go wider, you add more additional pieces, and and you put more stuff in it. ## A Simple Book Funnel Structure and its Conversion Metrics **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a basic book funnel structure, including a lead capture, order form, bump offer, upsell, and downsell. He shares conversion rates for each stage, highlighting the importance of the bump offer in boosting overall funnel economics. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So this is the. This is the simple funnel. We have a lead when someone comes in, because they they enter their details. In the box before they buy the book, and then they're showing the the order form and the upsell. We have a bump which increases the economics immediately inside the car. We then have an upsell and a downsell I know Chris runs more complex book funnels than this, and I have before, where I've had multiple upsells, multiple downsells, and everything. I am confident that with the structure you can get all the economics you need out of a book funnel up to a thousand bucks a day in ad spend. If you get, keep it simple and keep it right by swapping these things out. ## Book, Bump, Upsell, and Downsell Examples **Summary:** James Kemp provides specific examples of his book, bump offer, upsell, and downsell, emphasizing the importance of clear messaging and offering additional value at each stage. He highlights two effective bump offer strategies: behind-the-scenes walkthroughs and additional templates. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the book is this, and we I'm giving you all these templates, and most of you have seen the book funnel. But I'm gonna give you the individual components so we can reverse engineer them for you. So the book, it does what it says on the tin. I've got a book there that talks about the suffering consultant, and obviously what you get. the playbook for building a million dollar per year. Solo consultancy with 65 clients or less than 2 days a week. So I'm super explicit about what it is and who it's for, and the byline, because no one really knows what a sovereign consultant is until I introduce the idea. So the bump is a really important one. You get the bump right? And you're most of the way to solving the economics of this. So there's 2 bumps that have worked extremely well for me. There's a behind the scenes. Walkthrough. ## The First Upsell: A Key Signal of Client Intent **Summary:** The first upsell in a book funnel is crucial not only for boosting revenue but also as a strong indicator of a customer's likelihood of becoming a client. Those who invest in the upsell often demonstrate a higher level of commitment and desire for further assistance. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the 1st upsell is the is the big one. This upsells priced at 200 bucks. and it's a deep dive in terms of the concept and in terms of the contents of the book. So my 1st upsell is the 3 K code and the social code those bundled together

. Those who invest in the upsell often demonstrate a higher level of commitment and desire for further assistance. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the 1st upsell is the is the big one. This upsells priced at 200 bucks. and it's a deep dive in terms of the concept and in terms of the contents of the book. So my 1st upsell is the 3 K code and the social code those bundled together. If someone was to buy them, separately, as courses currently run for a thousand bucks, right? And I'm and I can. I'm giving it to them for 2 200 bucks. So there's not much more to say, apart from more of the same right. This is the the step by step, training or take, you, show you how to make a 3 k. Offer. Take it to 3 KA week, and then 3 KA day. And again, the social code which talks about, the social, the social posts that we make, and and and ultimately, how we set those up. ## The Downsell: Simplifying the Offer and Maintaining Intent **Summary:** The downsell should be a simplified version of the first upsell, often unbundling the offer to provide a more accessible entry point. This strategy captures those who are interested but not ready for the full upsell, while still maintaining a relatively high level of intent. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Break up the upsell. Just make your life easy. Right? So if the if the if the 1st upsell is a bundle of things. break up the bundle and just offer one of them. So I we we cut. We. We chop up the social code and the 3 K code and say, Hey, wait! We've got. I really want you to have this. I really, I really need you to have this. I'm going to do it for a hundred bucks. and that converts obviously at a slightly higher level than even the upsell. So the people who are going through that again have relatively high intent ## Chris Benetti on Upsells, Downsells, and Consumption Formats **Summary:** Chris Benetti explains the importance of offering different consumption formats in upsells and downsells. People learn and absorb information differently, so providing varied options, such as video courses or action guides, can significantly increase conversions. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I think you nailed a lot of the good points here. Just from a visitor perspective. from an upselling point of view. and people people different formats of consumption, they'll get a book. And a book is . we all know books are valuable there's no doubt about it. But how how tangible is it going to be for me to be able to, potentially, get a step by step, action guide to implementing some of the strategies, sure, there's going to be a level of that in a written format. But, I think the reason why James's upsells and downsells convert so well, I think it's it's it's over 20% combined, which, if we think about that as a as an average, that's a hundred $50 average between the 2, that's a fantastic add on to the average order, value. ## Completeness in Offers and the Value of Transparency **Summary:** Offers, including books and upsells, should be complete and provide genuine value without holding back key information. This builds trust with clients and demonstrates a commitment to their success, leading to higher quality client relationships. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** They do. And again, it's that idea of completeness. You can't hold back on this stuff. I don't think you can. I don't think you should hold back on any offer. But there there is

. This builds trust with clients and demonstrates a commitment to their success, leading to higher quality client relationships. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** They do. And again, it's that idea of completeness. You can't hold back on this stuff. I don't think you can. I don't think you should hold back on any offer. But there there is. There has to be a sense and a and a and a and a real outcome of them being able to do it without you right. And it is really tempting to hold back on some of this stuff. But because you're I want them to become a client. So I'm just gonna hold back on a little piece the best stuff, the stuff that just sells out the gates, day, one is a how to book with everything it needs off the back of it. And the type of clients you get from that value. Input, they value perspective. And they value time, compression because they know that you're not holding back on them to try and manipulate them into. Oh, he's held back the last step. So I need to. I need to buy that thing. And then there's some tension there. ## Selling Off the Title: Clarity and Binary Offers **Summary:** The title of your book should clearly and concisely convey its core message, allowing potential buyers to quickly determine its relevance. This "selling off the title" approach creates a binary offer: either the title resonates, and they engage, or it doesn't, and they move on. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So before I before I move on to the ads, because there's a lot of variables there. I want to talk about selling off the title. When you look at a book funnel, and when you look at the the work required to do them. It can be overwhelming, right? Oh, I need a lot of I need a lot of words. I need a lot of selling. I am the world's laziest man. and the concept that I always come to with products and offers is selling off the title right. If someone reads the title of the book. Then they get what it's about immediately. There is no abstraction, there is no vagueness. there is no, there's nothing left to say in that. The playbook for building a million dollar per year. Solo consultancy with 65 clients or less than 2 days a week. Right? It is binary right, and all the copy which is not copy is just words flows from there to handle the things that someone thinks about before they buy something. Right? ## Book Sales Page Structure: Addressing Common Questions **Summary:** The book sales page should expand on the title, addressing common questions potential buyers might have. This includes an origin story, current relevance, content overview, pricing, guarantee, and a clear call to action. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the idea I want you to think about is selling off the title that it is binary. The people who are interested are going to start reading the people who aren't interested and are going to be that's not for me. I want 75 clients, and I want to work 9 days a week, and I'm, bye. And that's okay. So selling off the title is that the the thing that you have in both an imagery because you've got the you've got the opportunity to have an imagery in a book cover. both in terms of the imagery and the words used. You sell off the title. It is super clear what it is. It may not be ultimately clear who it's for, necessarily. And they need some context for that. But it's super clear what it is, and they start to lean in

. So selling off the title is that the the thing that you have in both an imagery because you've got the you've got the opportunity to have an imagery in a book cover. both in terms of the imagery and the words used. You sell off the title. It is super clear what it is. It may not be ultimately clear who it's for, necessarily. And they need some context for that. But it's super clear what it is, and they start to lean in. ## Binary Offers and the Importance of Explicitness **Summary:** Effective offers, especially for books, should be binary and explicit, clearly stating what they are and who they are for. This approach allows potential buyers to quickly self-select, leading to higher conversion rates and more qualified leads. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** And I want you to see the cover of your book and the lead as as an offer. Come here or go away right? So when when we're getting in there, all we're doing is unpacking the common questions they have. How does this work? When do I get it? What's the guarantee? etc? Right? And then they click in. So it works because it's binary and so lead with the stuff. A book is not the time to be cute about your pieces, or the mechanisms, or vague in terms of how you present it. It works because it's there, and then everything cascades from that, because then they're getting to this page right if you haven't got them. And the central idea on the 1st page in the bump, this page doesn't work. and then the downsell doesn't work either. And then the experience doesn't work at all right. So think about selling off the title and and ultimately making it binary. ## Book Funnel Ads: New Book Angle and For-Sale Ads **Summary:** Two effective ad strategies for book funnels are the "new book" angle, leveraging the inherent appeal of novelty, and simple for-sale ads that clearly state the product and target audience. Combining these approaches can cater to a wider range of potential buyers. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So we're running currently 2 types of ads. There's there's a time based one. And these are converting it different ratios, because one's longer and one's just shorter and and more explicit. When you have a book out you can use the old thing of it's new, right? People things that are new because they're better than things that are old in people's minds. So words free words new are great things that you can put into your marketing because they are naturally attractive to people. So I've always run new book ads. Candidly, even when the book. Isn't that new? I still run new book ads because it's new to them, right?, I'm trading an ethical line there. But it's new. It's new to somebody. They've never seen it before. So it's new I'm trying to justify. ## Ad Creative and Copy Variations: Feeding the Algorithm **Summary:** Modern advertising algorithms require a large volume of creative and copy variations. Repurposing successful organic content can be an effective strategy for generating ad variations and feeding the algorithm's demand for fresh content. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So with algorithms and distribution these days, the big thing is as creative and copy variations. I keep promising them. I'm going to write some bang along form. I haven't quite hasn't quite come to me yet, but it will come to me where I'll I'll write my I write another one of my disruption ads, or something that you we can probably run for a couple of years. . I've got it in me somewhere. It's just buried in the subconscious right now. But the the balance between, a long form ad

. I keep promising them. I'm going to write some bang along form. I haven't quite hasn't quite come to me yet, but it will come to me where I'll I'll write my I write another one of my disruption ads, or something that you we can probably run for a couple of years. . I've got it in me somewhere. It's just buried in the subconscious right now. But the the balance between, a long form ad. and again use something that works organically. All my long form ads are variants of something that's worked organically on the platform that we put it on. So if you've had a great Facebook post, if you've had a great Linkedin post. If you've had something that's worked particularly well on Instagram that will work as an ad. ## Chris Benetti on Ad Simplicity and Avoiding Overcomplication **Summary:** Chris Benetti cautions against overcomplicating ads and funnels, advising to keep things simple and avoid getting bogged down in complex technical strategies. Focus on getting the core message out and generating clients. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I think there's opportunity to overcomplicate ads a lot, and especially if you start this. Okay, this whole thing. Right? Oh, yeah, definitely, yes. I would just say, be wary of the gurus who are technical ad people or technical funnel people, because they'll make you try to build a complicated system. And ultimately it's all gonna stop you from getting the shit out there and getting it done and getting clients from it. So, keep it simple is probably the biggest piece of feedback around ads that I've got. ## Book Funnels: DIY vs. Agency Management **Summary:** While DIY book funnel management is feasible up to a certain ad spend, scaling and optimizing for larger budgets often requires expert assistance. Investing in agency support can be beneficial for maximizing long-term returns and avoiding the complexities of high-spend ad campaigns. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Yeah, I before I move on to the client speed I really want you to take away today that a book isn't hard, right? What is hardest, scaling it. getting the economics right, feeding it with creative. And and those things I believe in terms of . Candidly, you can diy this up to a hundred, or, maybe a little bit more a day in terms of ad spend and find your feet and optimize it yourself past that, and to really turn it into a big asset. It's it's complicated because there's a lot of moving parts that you want to get right in the funnel, and there's a lot of moving parts that you get right in the ads. ## Converting Book Customers into Clients: Waitlists and Live Workshops **Summary:** Two effective strategies for converting book customers into clients are using waitlists, which automatically funnel customers into client programs, and hosting live workshops, which offer high conversion rates and opportunities for direct client pitches. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the final, you've got your book. You've got your funnel. You've got some ads up, and you've probably promoted organically as well. You've started talking about it. The 1st 4 months of the sovereign consultant was just me talking about it, and I sold 500 copies of the book just by signing up for the book. Right? The the key piece, and the piece of both. The other piece of experimentation is around converting those those book customers into clients. So I've done 2 things, and I'm gonna double down on one of these things. and discard the other just through experimentation. So the 1st one is putting them on a wait list. And if you want the wait list again, it's in the waitlist training in in the classroom

. Right? The the key piece, and the piece of both. The other piece of experimentation is around converting those those book customers into clients.

And if you want the wait list again, it's in the waitlist training in in the classroom. ## Live Workshops: A High-Leverage Path to Client Acquisition **Summary:** Live workshops are a highly effective method for converting customers to clients. They provide valuable content, increase time on brand, and offer a natural opportunity to pitch client programs. A converting live workshop can also become a standalone product, further increasing leverage. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I'm going to double down on live workshops for 2 reasons. A live workshop is a better product than a static course. So I'm gonna change my $200 upsell into a a course and a program and bonuses. But it's around a live workshop. and a live workshop is a much higher converting path from customers to clients right? We know around here that, people can easily get 10 to 40% of people who come to a workshop into their community or client program. If I was starting from scratch I would sell a live workshop in the funnel and get people who buy the book into that into that live workshop and ultimately pitch the client program from there. ## Book Funnel Templates, the Sovereign Book Club, and Done-For-You Services **Summary:** James Kemp offers funnel templates and announces the Sovereign Book Club, an 8-week program to help participants create, market, and launch their own book funnels. A done-for-you service is also available for those who prefer to outsource the process. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So 2 things left. We've got some swipes. Chris has put together way more than I asked him to. He's massively over delivered. We've got creative swipes. We got the copy swipes. and we've got the funnel template. This is the I'm not sure if you can see that this is the live book funnel that we're running on software consultant. So as you can see, it's done. 40 ish brand on the front end. This is the exact funnel that I've given you. So I've given you everything in this one. So it's got the sales page, the upsell, the downsell, the confirmation, and then we've included the wait list, and then we've included the delivery components of the of the different of the different upsells and downsells, so you can drop your upsell and downsell, and that delivery. ## The Sovereign Book Club: An 8-Week Book Funnel Creation Program **Summary:** The Sovereign Book Club offers an 8-week guided program for creating a book, developing upsells, building a funnel, and running paid ads.
