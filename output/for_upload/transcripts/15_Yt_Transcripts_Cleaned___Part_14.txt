# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 14

it if there's no true genuine desire there yeah it's very difficult to acquire skills when you don't have desire behind them yeah it's very difficult to wear I really want to be good at this and I need to be good at this when there's no actual want deep inside you to want to do it well well I think we'll come back to this but this idea that business needs to be hard is a really prevalent one because I think business is already hard because we have to grow and gain skills and stick out things things and develop character traits that allow us to focus on one thing for a really long time but then people also make it unnecessarily hard they go well I'm not good at this so I must get better at it because I I don't want to have a weak Link in the chain I don't want to have a hole in the bucket but man we have friends who have great businesses and suck at huge parts of it right they either hire around themselves we have multi-millionaire friends who can barely tie their shoes yeah yeah yeah that's a reality yeah and I'm useless at some some very normal we talked about this with life admin right yeah I would way rather be hit with a hundred thousand dollar tax bill and have to figure that out over the next month then organize a youth camp the scale of of the problem is significantly different but the complexity or even just if you peel it back if I had to buy our groceries every week and things that it sounds so such a luxury but those things stress me out those everyday things but but so many entrepreneurs think they need a master at all I need to have all of the things me good at Marketing sales maybe the best dad the best husband and then that means I need to take all of the stereotypical things I need to be amazing at sitting down and playing with my kids with Lego for hours at a time I need to have the Lawns mode the Hedge trimmed whatever else but you bring that to business it's the same deal my take is that it's a product of weaponizing Shame right and it starts at a young age because we need the system needs people to be in a certain way and compliant with doing those things in productive and with weaponized shame and now we've Amplified it with this thing called the internet to say if you don't want things these things you're not normal then there's something wrong with you if you don't want to be this if you don't want to spend your days that if you don't believe these things then there's something morally wrong with you and we're going to shame you yeah and it's weaponized everywhere yeah and it's weaponized by people's Often by the people that are closest to the recipient of that shame right because they're you should want this I was asked by people who came to visit a couple of weeks ago as we're sitting in our house with our staff everybody here has local staff we have a family it's true guys and they're how do you feel about these people serving you and I was amazing amazing because this family have a house here they've got Vehicles they've got they send their kids to school that their son's getting a higher education because they work for me and they love my kids just they're their own it feels great but that's just one example of things to be well you shouldn't have people serve you yet as an entrepreneur your time time is the only scarce thing on earth unless you yield it properly with the skill set that you were either innately given and Amplified you are going to fail to create the most value you possibly can so you should be ashamed of doing the things you're bad at and doing the things that you shouldn't be doing because it's going to cost you and it's going to cost the people who depend on you yeah and this this is we'll get to it in a second but let's talk about Sam ovens because he went through that period which is what my mind is going to now but most people listening

.co.nz there's a picture of this Penthouse apartment I think it's 2014. he's right in the Auckland viaduct in the harbor he's got a zebra rug a motorcycle a pistol all of these Antiques and things that around this house and he's just the cool dude of Auckland but who was this guy that you met at that time so I was I was in that transition so I was still Consulting for the main the main guys and I was still acting marketing director but I wasn't employed by them so I was running I'm going out Consulting and I reached out to him because he'd been on Mexico oh yeah with SNAP inspect and his software company his software company at the time and I met this extremely confident it's not nose kid really that's what I thought when I walked away because he's he's 10 years 12 years younger than me yeah and I was big swinging dick I work for the fastest growing country and Company in the country you've got it all worked out but but I was enthralled by his confidence and his and his vision about I just do Consulting to generate cash flow to build the software company and at the time the software company was the main thing and then in a software company if anyone who doesn't know was an app for property managers property inspection probably inspection it was really good I'm not a property manager but it you can take fixtures and it solved a real pain problem it still exists and he's yeah since the interview lots of people reached out talk about because he he kind of alluded to this doing consulting to generate cash flow for other things or because that was this angle at the time and that's what he was doing and he said I'm starting a thing and at the time it was a Dropbox folder full of stuff and it was just putting online and kajabi and I signed up months later when it was a proper products do you remember all that those six grand six grand and this is twenty he did me a solid though he did it in New Zealand Dollars oh my man he did at the time that was very welcome yeah because I think six grand us at the time was 10 grand kiwi or something that yeah and he's dude don't tell anyone but I'll do it in kiwi dollars thanks bro yeah and this was 2014. 2015. oh it's later than that right no about 2015. yeah yeah it would be about 20 2014 2015

. so he's based in New Zealand Consulting is is a side hustle and you get into this Dropbox community of there's some trainings there's no Consulting accelerator that many people would have experienced later yeah and what was that experience because because at this point I imagine you're still Consulting in person I was still Consulting in person and we moved to waiheke island off Auckland and so I was starting commuting and I was I've got a job again I've got a flipping job again right and because it was single source of income have to get up have to go to a place have to stay there have to come back and hop on a boat to get to Auckland boat yeah wait if anyone who doesn't know waiheke island is not connected via a bridge it's a 45 year 35 yes 35 minute Theory and it's a beautiful Lifestyle on there but then to have to go to the CBD or wherever you're going every day that was yeah it drained me real quick yeah and after having all those ideas sitting in my head and then that sub track playing in the background through podcasts and things of freedom and location Independence and digital nomadism I needed to do my own thing and so through Sam's course I launched my first product e-commerce engine and then we did a million and it was about 13 months yeah well yeah talk about timing as well unfair advantages back in the day when you could get leads for a dollar on Facebook and course 50 bucks yeah yeah but just got on the phone first price point was 2500 yeah then put it up to 6 Grand later so walk me through that process so you've got all this expertise you've built in person he tells you how to package it into a course or are you coaching one-to-one what does that look yeah the classic course with calls model that I call it now I had a Google drive folder with six modules in it and an introduction yeah a free Facebook group no sorry a Facebook group which is obviously free but paid for for clients yeah and then then a weekly call with what was it called on go to webinar oh goodness yeah 400 bucks a month at the time man yeah that's crazy yeah we don't know how good I'm done now it was great yeah and e-commerce them was really fragmented so it's pre-shopify so it was really people had all these different it wasn't pre-shopify but it was early it wasn't a big thing it is now the de facto solution for Ecom yeah so all these people had all these different platforms and the tech stuff was a bit of a nightmare yeah so to give them email templates and card abandoned sequences and conversion and Facebook ad templates it was a brand new thing at the time to that to that market it was what you give me stuff that works out of the box and I just go and copy and paste it and you help me modify it and I use it and it makes money yeah cool and so that was the most natural people for you to work with I guess having got come from grab one and Groupon yeah was you're now just in that e-commerce space you're not a coach helping coaches get clients it's you have an e-commerce store it's I've seen three billion dollars of e-commerce transactions flow past my herbals yeah so I was I know how to make people buy stuff online yeah so what was that learning curve going online the biggest learning curve was just the deployment of it because I thought I had to know all the tech and all those things the click funnels templates and that stuff yeah so that's all the stuff that that tripped me up sorry guys quick technical difficulty I had a camera that overheated we are back in the game so we're talking about you coaching online e-commerce and talking about the learning curve and so the biggest challenge for you at that time was the deployment they're getting the stuff done yeah going through all the steps yeah well it's the the stuff that you think you need that you don't really

all those things the click funnels templates and that stuff yeah so that's all the stuff that that tripped me up sorry guys quick technical difficulty I had a camera that overheated we are back in the game so we're talking about you coaching online e-commerce and talking about the learning curve and so the biggest challenge for you at that time was the deployment they're getting the stuff done yeah going through all the steps yeah well it's the the stuff that you think you need that you don't really yeah and the the first iteration of that course was I've got to get this done screw it so that's why I use Google drive right and a Facebook group and that because I was sick of passing around and procrastinating on myself going I need to host it in an online thing yeah and it's the same thing now with I need all this stuff to be to make it look a certain way yeah so I was much more worried about what people thought about it then it was it something that you were getting from Sam as well at the time meaning you bought into a program that was awesome on Dropbox because I'm sure at that time there were some people that just changed it so I didn't I wasn't I was on the cusp of there was still stuff stored there yeah and I think the first iteration was just a tree of files and then there was the kajabi stuff and videos and again it was building it as we were going through it yeah the first version up level well I think one of the the best I don't know if you said this out loud or if this was just something I took from Consulting accelerator but when I started in 2018 yeah I had skills that I could transfer to marketing but I had no marketing experience per se I had no ads experience no funnels and so I was really good at sales so I was getting people to say yes and then going all right now I need to figure out how to do this and I'll never forget just the belief I got from going through this program was I need to believe my ability to figure it out so I never forget hiring a a getting a client and I was doing something around his content and then he hired me to do his Facebook ads and my confidence came from the fact that Sam had all the modules on Facebook ads in there even though I hadn't gone through them and never run a Facebook ad so I run this client's card and he's yeah man really need these ads to work and I'm they're gonna to be amazing right and then I go through all of Sam's stuff and then overnight and then at 5am I launched the client's ads and then the next morning I wake up however many hours are later and he's got all of these webinar registrations and his crushing but for me it was that delusion that even though I didn't have the expertise I could borrow it from someone else and also I just I needed to believe my ability to figure it out and I think that's a belief that served me so much I don't know if there was anything around that time that that carried you through belief-wise can you remember what your self-taught was in that time because you were going from in person to online you're running ads people were now probably talking crap on your ads and you're now an expert selling a product what was that self-talk that was a complete Paradox because I was the big deal I was a marketing director of the fastest growing company in the country so it was a paradox of the small Fray internet little tiny stuff was who cares right what's the big deal but the ego was the thing that was preventing me from doing the stuff I needed to do because it didn't look right right so both of those opposing forces got me stuck right in terms of not launching it fast enough not hitting the ground running because when I did it was it was off straight away so there was a paradox of I'm really good look at this this stuff's little it's so easy I

paradox of the small Fray internet little tiny stuff was who cares right what's the big deal but the ego was the thing that was preventing me from doing the stuff I needed to do because it didn't look right right so both of those opposing forces got me stuck right in terms of not launching it fast enough not hitting the ground running because when I did it was it was off straight away so there was a paradox of I'm really good look at this this stuff's little it's so easy I could phone it in yeah but also I needed it to look a certain way because I was worried people went away you've got a reputation you've got yeah yeah I get it so it was the worst Paradox you can get because the two opposing forces of the equal you're just stuck in place yeah and I was for months stuck in place doing what were you were you doing the equivalent of I'm building a website for myself I was doing the equivalent of I'm gonna move these boxes around on this landing page and make and do the slides for that vsl video again yeah yeah and by Friday it will be done oh no I should change that word right perfectionist procrastination yeah because I was worried about what people would think about it which I think is human nature I think there'd be a lot of people listening who laugh at something that and go I remember those days or that's so funny but most of my coaching calls are dealing with people even at multiples and figures who were just overthinking stuff they're they're in they're in a that a loop of productive procrastination I'm not not this is one of the things I've learned about entrepreneurs normal people when they're overwhelmed or unclear right normally right they they don't do anything right so that's why when you talk to normal people the everyday person around procrastination it's such a huge topic because they're struggling with inaction most entrepreneurs struggle with too much action they're taking so much action in so many different directions that it's the thing causing them to not move forward because they're productively procrastinating right so instead of me creating the module I'm going to listen to 10 podcasts and five of the best YouTube videos on it and read three books on it so that I create the perfect podcast of the perfect module or the whatever it may be yeah and that version of what you went through I'm trying to get the landing page perfect is the same thing that everyone goes through it just looks different it looks more mature that it's the same behavior in that same whether it's scarcity or insecurity or inadequacy driving people for I'm just waiting for it to be perfect right that's it's a perfectionism that people wrestle fully I think also that there's also as you grow up there's a there's a creation of optionality get this thing so you can get that thing get the get the qualification so you can get the job so if you create options for yourself if you create more options yourself for yourself it's better the reality is very different the more options just lead you to more more noise in the system to say what's the actual signal and because it's the hardest question to answer what do I want right so that you get more options to get things that other people want that you think you should want so then you just get stuck because you're dealing with your own internal procrastination but you're also looking at the wants of others and going maybe I should want that maybe what I want isn't good enough yeah I totally agree and I think that's the whole idea of people are suffering from the the silent disease of of confusion or lack of clarity is so true yeah right most people just do not know what they want or if or if they know what they want they don't know why they want it oh you want to get to 50K a month why sounds great 100 camera I would love to shake Russell brunson's hand but they don't have a vision that's fueled by a motivation that will

I totally agree and I think that's the whole idea of people are suffering from the the silent disease of of confusion or lack of clarity is so true yeah right most people just do not know what they want or if or if they know what they want they don't know why they want it oh you want to get to 50K a month why sounds great 100 camera I would love to shake Russell brunson's hand but they don't have a vision that's fueled by a motivation that will push them through and so they're just stuck in cycles of I think the part at the end of the rainbow is going to be awesome and it's going to be a 50k a month and then you get there and it's not there yeah people don't typically have a Clear Vision with a clear motivation that's going to push them through the different seasons yeah I also I also see that there's also the other sea there's a lack of consequence right yeah yeah there's we we love Clarity but we also act on consequence and an example would be in our friends group at the moment lots of parents in their 40s and a couple of people have died of heart attacks right right and their 40s too early too young and it has prompted lots of people to look at their genetic line get tested heart health diet all those things but until then everyone was carrying on eating the fried food and doing the doing all the things because there was there's no obvious consequence to the behavior and people go oh you want to live long time for your kids and they they sound nice in a theory in a theoretical way but when it comes to it fried chips taste nice and and beer is good sometimes but I think it's also consequence there's very in Comfort there's very little consequence yeah there's very little consequence to not doing the thing yeah and this is why I see so many entrepreneurs driven by the darkness driven by that dark thing of I've got to prove my dad wrong yeah I was born when I was young that teacher who said that I was never going to amount to anything and when I was 14 that the seeds of that are there yeah and the consequence of not doing it is more internal pain yeah and the the benefit of doing it is a some misaligned view that that will provide relief from that pain yeah and so I think consequence motivates most action and you don't need to be clear about something to do it yeah because Clarity is a fiction how when covert everyone was wow well this is really we didn't see this coming and it's we never see the future coming yeah it's a ludicrous analogy because it's we didn't see the future coming before covert and we don't see the future coming during it and after yeah in these ideas you can't even say covert you've got to get it out the thing the thing that happened in 2020 but that there was there's this idea that Clarity needs to be present before we take action there's an idea that belief needs to be present to take action and I was sharing with clients recently of I need so little evidence now to believe in something we call it Instinct and we call these accumulated wisdom and all this stuff but I see something working once and I'm I'm gonna do a lot more of this yeah yeah and I think as you go along you you don't need as much belief because you you can pattern match some things and go well this is this so I'm going to do more of it right and you don't need belief and Clarity to do it but you need some consequence to make you move otherwise you ain't doing it isn't that fascinating thing about the amount of convincing you need to start a business versus the amount of convincing you need to launch a new offer right people can convince themselves in a heartbeat to go I need to launch a new tripwire a new funnel whatever but to get over that hump of belief around I have something to to give of value is this huge
