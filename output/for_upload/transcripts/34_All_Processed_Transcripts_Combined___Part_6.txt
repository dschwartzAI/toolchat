# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 6

The language is unforceful.

 This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings. ## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles **Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened? Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them. Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week. Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed. Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days. It's sexy to the right person. Helping people get their first 500 or next 500. Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event. If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter. Small promises are easy to keep. Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this? A community connects them. You're building a network. What's in it for them? The first sale is to yourself. Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes. Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase? If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific. Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution? The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community. Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle. What happens? We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan. You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing. What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance. Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers. Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: 
> "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."

Guy: My offer is for project managers: 6-figure role, reduced stress. Is that enough to differentiate? Most people would take a little bit more stress for more money. Focus on the 6-figure PM job. Reduced stress is the next problem to solve. Every solution creates another problem. Ahmed: My community offer value drops after 4-5 months. Should I switch to a one-time payment and smaller weekly fee? Pricing is a proxy for value. Why don't you deliver more value? We have weekly trainings. I could teach more, but I'm running out of things to teach. Most businesses have the fundamentals. Bad businesses look for the new piece. Repackage the fundamentals. Give them old value in new ways. Maximize value, maintain/increase price. Khan: I'm launching a community offer in English: $50/week for calls and community, $150/week for implementation, $250/week for WhatsApp, $750/week for one-on-one. Too complicated? Launch the middle two tiers in a hybrid: $100 and $250. The $100 is an easy start point, the $250 allows for higher-level access. More creates confusion. Treat free members as leads. This is the founding offer. Stefan: I'm working on an offer for customer experience optimization. How do I get specific on the goal when outcomes are different? You choose the playground. The sovereign community offer ($3k to $3k/week) isn't relevant for a $13M/year client. Who's your first customer? A medical supplies business with high turnover, low staff, no digital expert. Currency can be time and energy. Installing one system saves 10 hours/week. What do they want? Demand and money are unlimited. What's the intersection? Sell to the demand that's already there. Adam: How many benefits can be added? All of them, but lead with the core. What if tier one is live a better life, tier two is making money? Too confusing. Tier two is faster, more access. How to get paid in full? Both ways work. For large discounts, don't mention it in the doc. For bonuses, pre-sell it. The $100/week is a strong enough lead. Put offer hypotheses in the community for feedback. Specificity is key. Train yourself to be specific, and it carries over to all communication. Things people can point at are footholds on your content. ## Workshops as a Client Acquisition Strategy **Summary:** This segment focuses on using workshops as a powerful tool for acquiring clients. James emphasizes creating workshops that deliver real value, focusing on client needs, and strategically making offers within the workshop context. Video Source:* 100Dollar Offers.txt **Content:** So when I am starting to think about a workshop, I'm always looking at what clients want. The reason I'm holding a workshop about workshops is that the market is in a low-trust place, and workshops are effective for building trust. The market has become cynical, and workshops are an antidote because they allow you to demonstrate value. Once we've got a concept of what clients need, we turn it into an offer. I make the distinction between products and offers. Products are something we do, an offer is something people engage with. So I package it up in a way that is attractive. $100 is a nice price point. Workshops are challenging if you're doing something brand new. They're not necessarily a place to test concepts, but they are a place to reframe, reiterate, reteach, and remind clients. We have fatigue, life gets in the way, people get off track. The best workshops reiterate, reteach, and remind, giving them a new frame. You need people to do shit. The people who do stuff for you are sick to death of being fat

. Workshops are challenging if you're doing something brand new. They're not necessarily a place to test concepts, but they are a place to reframe, reiterate, reteach, and remind clients. We have fatigue, life gets in the way, people get off track. The best workshops reiterate, reteach, and remind, giving them a new frame. You need people to do shit. The people who do stuff for you are sick to death of being fat. No more convincing will get them to that point apart from being utterly fed up. People buy stuff to make feelings go away. Show them what works in the workshop, give them the blueprint. Package it into a solution, the 7-day fasting solution. After 7 days, if they want to become a client, credit their workshop investment. Focus on people who are ready. People don't wake up ready because of an email. They wake up sick of feeling a certain way. Nurturing and educating doesn't move the needle. I try and say the same thing 10 different ways. The workshop frame is self-contained. They give everyone a result. The worst mistake is holding a workshop just to get customers. The more you try and manipulate, the worse it does. It's tempting to leave out pieces, but that's a huge mistake. You're under-delivering. I sold over a thousand $100 tickets and over 500 at other price points last year. 100% refund guarantee, and we did 5. A workshop is self-contained, has everything needed inside it. The approach is trust. The best clients understand the value of proximity and insight. They get the information and decide they want to be closer. Most people are fine with information. The majority will do nothing. Some will try. Some will see it work and come back. Some will think it's harder than it looked and need help. If you measure workshops only on conversion rate, you are back to marketing, and most people suck at marketing. A workshop is self-contained, gives everyone a result, and trust happens after. Are you ready? If you are, show up. I've got the safest way. Don't use the word "proven." The longer I go at this, the less prepared I am to convince. Here's an offer. Here's another. You stop where you want. People make themselves ready. Marketers have indoctrinated people to believe they can change minds, but that's mixing cause and effect. It's offers for people who are ready. Take your marketing hat off, you're not there to sell. Focus on giving them the result. One of the greatest gifts is a lack of anxiety. Aggressively marketing comes across as anxious. I come across I don't give a fuck. You're gonna do you, I'm gonna do me. The duality of good workshops is the more you create for clients, the more sales you make to customers best for clients. I want to work with people that understand the value of proximity. Results come from osmosis. Information is everywhere. The less sales I try to make, the more sales I make. I focus on client delivery. Flipping the script: a workshop sells tickets, delivers to clients, and generates clients. Two frames: part of client delivery ("This is a workshop for our members") and a small part of something larger. Show how it fits in the big picture. The people I had to do the most salesmanship with were the worst clients. All the desire exists. Just make offers. Don't spend time on a 42-step email sequence. They came to the conclusion themselves. If you give them too much, they'll go somewhere simpler. If you mismatch the energy, they'll think you just want their money. Don't be a marketer. Alexandra: I'm a marketer trying to get out of marketing. I run webinars for professional services businesses

Identify the time, who will use it, and give them the process. They have to do some labor. Otherwise, they buy courses. They don't buy group programs because they're not time efficient. They buy things one step away from done-for-you, but more economically viable. Alex is good at setting up Zoom and pixels. The sovereign blueprint is built on principles: 2 days a week, dinner with kids, nothing scheduled Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays. Coaching is helping people discover the answer inside them. Consulting is giving someone the answer. Mentorship is showing someone how I would do it. A creator conjures original ideas, a curator assembles the best ideas. If I do these things, this is how they come into fruition: share content, grow leads, create workshops, sell tickets, make it easy to get started, maximize client experience and LTV, build a client base, find those who value coaching. Hierarchy: maximum 24 people in the circle at $750/week, maximum 100 in the syndicate at $250/week, no maximum for membership. Many people intend to work with you. The key is making offers that get people to commit. Maybes kill progress. Offer-driven businesses don't get maybes. The strongest intent is purchasing. Understand their intent. When someone buys a $9 ticket, did they do it to get what was in the workshop, to run workshops, or because they're fed up? Most won't buy your coaching. The most efficient business has a range of offers. The sovereign blueprint: 2 days a week, $1M net/year, run on my own. Because workshops are one component of the sovereign blueprint. The judgment of a workshop is understood by looking at the marketplace. Most people won't buy. Most won't become clients. Most marketing filters through a thousand to find one unicorn client. The realities of market dynamics: not everyone will buy your stuff. Leverage is identifying who is likely to buy, who will buy regularly, and who would find further access useful. Customers are one-off transactions, clients are allocated time, energy, and resources. What people say and what people do are different. The key to an efficient business is making offers that get people to commit. Maybes kill progress. Offer-driven businesses don't get maybes. Purchasing demonstrates intent. Understand their intent. Most of the market won't buy your coaching. I operate within the power laws. Only so many will pay over $3k/month, and I can only coach so many effectively. I can mentor more, and information is infinitely scalable. I work backwards from what clients need. I sell workshop tickets by defining what my circle needs. I create for clients, give them proximity and access, insight and some access, and information. I turn creations into products, create customers, and invite them to become clients. I've got a call as an option. Create workshops for clients, sell tickets to customers. Pricing isn't irrelevant, but relatively unimportant. Any purchase is a trust signal. Purchasing has friction. Four types of offers: money offers and live a better life offers. $100 workshops work for money offers, $25-$50 for live a better life offers. Pricing is a dial for volume. The best thing about a workshop is it's a singular component. I produce a Google Doc and go live. To dial up clients, add a bonus call. Solve a single problem, deliver a single result. Sell them what they want, give them what they need. I trick my clients into coming by making it sound more fun. I'm a big proponent of selling the next thing, making it sound great, but delivering what they need. Magic pills sell. Frame it magically while staying ethical. If you're experienced, you can take more risks testing new ideas. I believe people's time is precious

. Solve a single problem, deliver a single result. Sell them what they want, give them what they need. I trick my clients into coming by making it sound more fun. I'm a big proponent of selling the next thing, making it sound great, but delivering what they need. Magic pills sell. Frame it magically while staying ethical. If you're experienced, you can take more risks testing new ideas. I believe people's time is precious. Repurposing something you're confident about and giving it a new frame is the best way to deliver. I've delivered workshops about workshops 3 times. I find new things, so I reteach. Remember they're a small sum of the larger part. I can't help you build a sovereign business in this workshop. There's a bigger piece. Three types of workshops: demonstration (show what's working, give them the things that work), model (show the overall model, give them a plan), and mechanism (help them use the mechanism to get a result). Demonstration: show what's working, why it works, give them the things that work, and let them replicate. I want people to copy me. Model: show the overall model, give them a plan, help them envisage theirs. Mechanism: help them use the mechanism to get a result. Traffic to your sales page is warm. You don't need long sales pages. Short, punchy, bullet-pointed pages work best. The more you give to sell, the more objections. Put logistical details on the sales page. Content pre-sells the sales page. 3-7 day promotion periods work well. Most people run out of things to say before 7 days. Content builds context. By the time they get to the sales page, they're sold on the context. Your workshop depends on your delivery method. Some do slides, workbooks, docs, straight to camera. I docs because they help me think. Delivery has two parts: the vehicle (document, slides) and the conversation (Q&A). Insight can happen during or after. The replay goes into the community. If they don't join, they get it on an ungated page. Ungated means it's pirated, but it works in your favor long-term. How do you get clients? The key metric is the number of offers you make. Insert the offer briefly but carefully. Client offers convert better when offered to customers. Workshops convert better than webinars. It's easier to sell to someone who's bought before. Five touch points: 24 hours and 60 minutes before, beginning, end, and replay. If you offer a call, that's a fifth touch point. The more offers you make, the more clients you get. Three common mistakes: building a workshop a webinar, building a workshop to sell (leaving pieces out), and creating workshops when desperate for clients. Even if you don't have clients, run a workshop for an imaginary client. Focus on delivery. Results are created long-term. Good results come from giving good insights, teaching, and experiences. If you focus on delivery, then have a system to distribute it, you'll get the best results. Your marketing becomes demonstration and distribution. Most people spend 80% of their time marketing, 20% delivering. I spend 80% creating for clients, 20% productizing and monetizing. I work backwards from what clients need. There's a paradox with workshops: some of the best for clients are the worst for customers. Think about turning workshops into long-term assets the same way you think about ads. Run 10 workshops to find the one that works long-term. Judge them on three dimensions: product, delivery, and client generation. What are you focusing on? Client acquisition? Run spicy workshops that give immediate results. When upselling, send reminders 24 hours and 60 minutes before

Run spicy workshops that give immediate results. When upselling, send reminders 24 hours and 60 minutes before. Deadlines are the most ethical scarcity. If you're doing things live, you have natural scarcity. Scarcity is interesting. If you impose it, it's not real. If you constrain yourself, it works. People choose round numbers 10. What about 3? Set yourself up to win. Winning is not losing. I put constraints on things that allow me to win by default. If you're in the season of wanting to push people, you might want short, intense volume. But as soon as you try and create scarcity, you're back to manipulation. Weekly workshops run out quick unless there's an anchor workshop repeated every second week. If going weekly, repeat something 50% of the time. If you open all workshops to clients, respect their time. With ads, you need instant gratification. Show-up rates plummet the further out you book. Run the previous workshop as a product, then have the live workshop periodically. Every quarter, I have a customers-only workshop. Selling multiple workshops together? What are you trying to do? Increase client quality? Churn reduction and retention is difficult to sell because it's invisible. Craft products that show where they start and where they go. How to double your $5k/month coaching business in 30 days. Growth is getting more clients, keeping clients longer, getting clients to pay more. Workshops are an antidote to expensive lead generation and long conversion cycles. Frame the workshop as exactly what clients need. Once you help people see power laws in their client base, they can double or triple their revenue from a single source. Making a workshop tangible in the personal development space? The root of every thought is a feeling. All feelings lead to thoughts lead to actions. Make it physically present, point out where and when it happens. People don't buy abstract things. They want to wake up without dread. Bring tangibility by making them physically present. Everything has a place. Tangibility of feelings has a place. Future pacing is pointing at things that will happen in the future. The more immediate, the more tangible. Personal development should focus on mechanisms. Get them out of their head. Get them to do something tangible. Even if it's brilliant, most won't do anything with it. Be a little less depressed every day. Change sells transformation. Bring them down to something to point at right now. How to generate content for email sequences? I look at things and go, "That's interesting!" I draw a vague line between the content and the offer. Boston challenge workshop or web class? What's the distinction? The web class shows them how, the workshop teaches. What do you want? Clients. $27 for the workshop, then invite them to become a client. Don't run a web class. What would it do that the workshop doesn't? This is marketing, more information. Focus on people who are ready. I've got the healthiest way for those who are ready. Don't use the word "proven." I'm less prepared to convince. Here's an offer. People make themselves ready. Marketers think they can change minds, but it's offers for people who are ready. Take your marketing hat off. Focus on the result. Give them a lack of anxiety. Aggressively marketing is anxious. I come across I don't give a fuck. You're going to do you, I'm going to do me. The more you create for clients, the more sales you make
