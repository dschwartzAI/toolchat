# James 3K Code Transcript - Part 1

James Kemp: So we're ready for the 3 K. Code. James Kemp: some more than others. James Kemp: Welcome to our Hello to the Syndicate people again. Our normal Tuesday morning slot has been hijacked for James Kemp: me talking to a Google, Doc for James Kemp: about 40 min. James Kemp: and then tomorrow again, and then tomorrow. And then when we have a QA. So I've got 2 Q&A's together syndicate people on Thursday. James Kemp: after we wrap this up. So I'm James Kemp: we'll be adding James Kemp: and subtracting and customizing as we go along, and welcome to James Kemp: welcome to our guests. James Kemp: so James Kemp: to get into it, permission to start. James Kemp: gonna share my screen James Kemp: and go along. James Kemp: Voice is a way. But Karkey. James Kemp: after a bit of travel. James Kemp: I say, I want to start. James Kemp: Everyone can see my screen. Good. Everyone can hear me fine James Kemp: and members, and to get people. Let's go straight into the classroom this afternoon, after. I guess we will give it as James Kemp: a single replay our first, and then I'll edit it over the next couple of weeks, and you'll have access to that, too. James Kemp: along with all the resources. So anything I show you today you get access to. James Kemp: So the 3 K code white people buy. So today is all about, I'm going to give you context. But today is all about assembling, crafting, and delivering a high, converting hybrid offer James Kemp: and I want the theme of all of this. We need the theme of all of this to make it simple. James Kemp: because everybody James Kemp: fucks it up when they get complicated when they think they are an exception, or you're looking for reasons why. And most of those are James Kemp: emotional and getting in the way. James Kemp: Because the 3. The 3 code is meant to be a prescription. James Kemp: So when we assemble that as a formula. so I do give variables. James Kemp: and, in the Q. And A. Afterwards we will talk about your specific variables, and I teach you how to think along the journey. But results will flow from following the prescription. So my job's to give you the prescription. James Kemp: And this formula is designed to be tight and minimal. I do not spend a lot of time or much really, or paying lip service to mindset or blockers, or particular reasons why it won't work or or will work. James Kemp: It fails if you try and look for complexity or more. Okay. James Kemp: because your job is assemble tests learn in a record. and all results James Kemp: in business happen in the marketplace. It doesn't happen in the consumption of ideas. And we all love ideas. We all love insight. We all love learning new things and gaining new insights because we get that little hit, and it feels exciting. But most people get in their own way James Kemp: to prevent themselves getting in the game. All the mine stuff of why, it won't work for me, or I'm an exceptional these pieces, but I can give you the formula. James Kemp: but you must mix the potion and apply it. James Kemp: The most difficult thing about working with me is I break it down into the simple bits that people don't, because then it becomes unavoidable that you have to do something with it. James Kemp: So this is a a prescription and a formula. but it's up to you to apply it. So James Kemp: the system we use. And there's some essential stages of evolution as we go into a marketplace

. James Kemp: but you must mix the potion and apply it. James Kemp: The most difficult thing about working with me is I break it down into the simple bits that people don't, because then it becomes unavoidable that you have to do something with it. James Kemp: So this is a a prescription and a formula. but it's up to you to apply it. So James Kemp: the system we use. And there's some essential stages of evolution as we go into a marketplace. So to generate a client, we can simply break it into phases. We can have a lead. So someone within the right to communicate with a customer someone who's transacted with us or a client, someone who we commit time resources to. James Kemp: And these distinctions are very useful and important, because they allow us to design for those particular stages. James Kemp: and then we can break it down, because, to obtain a client efficiently. Most demonstrate confidence in each stage. So people can skip any of these stages. Someone can become a lead and quickly become a client. But this is an exception rather than the rule. James Kemp: Daniel, yesterday who was we were talking about? The send to get back and forth is . James Kemp: Hey, I this. You can try before you buy, and that is exactly the frame of a customer versus a client. This is an interaction. Does he it? What what's it gonna do? What does it work? Let's have a look under the hood to see how it feels, etc., etc. James Kemp: So for a client to ascend and identify themselves. We must understand intent and desire. And the fastest way to understand intent is desire and initiate a transaction, get someone to give you money James Kemp: right? Because behind that is some intent and a single signal of desire. So for someone to give you money, you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something to desire. James Kemp: So the system we are building James Kemp: is just this blueprint. James Kemp: We have James Kemp: 2 levels of client offer. We have at most a couple of customer offers. James Kemp: And then we have a big idea, and that sequence is very important. James Kemp: And it's very distinct in terms of how we're going to work through. James Kemp: So for clients, we have a community offer and one upgrade option James Kemp: for customers. We have one-time products to generate, customers in cash flow. And ultimately this model is offer-driven. James Kemp: So we get leads. We turn them into customers, and we turn those customers into clients James Kemp: it's nothing more difficult than that. But simple and easier different things. James Kemp: And this is the model I use because I aim to do as little selling and marketing as possible. James Kemp: I just want to demonstrate and make offers. James Kemp: This is the thing that works for me is how it could work for you. Do you want some help doing it. James Kemp: and that is available to everybody. So, working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long-term relationships and to find those I create clients and help them generate value. James Kemp: to find clients. I generate customers to understand their intent, and to find customers, and demonstrate my ideas, to earn attention and trust. If we approach everything as an offer, whether it's free or paid, it helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible. James Kemp: So if I can leave you with one thing is teaching you how to think about making offers. You'll have a highly efficient, highly lucrative, highly fun business. James Kemp: because it will. People will find their natural place James Kemp: because clients are not created equal and power laws apply. the majority of the market are James Kemp: in pain and have a problem and are relatively opportunity unaware

. James Kemp: So if I can leave you with one thing is teaching you how to think about making offers. You'll have a highly efficient, highly lucrative, highly fun business. James Kemp: because it will. People will find their natural place James Kemp: because clients are not created equal and power laws apply. the majority of the market are James Kemp: in pain and have a problem and are relatively opportunity unaware. James Kemp: The the majority of the market will be down there where they'll spend, up to, a few $100 with you at the most, and never go from there. James Kemp: There's a portion of the market that are problem aware, but solution unaware. James Kemp: They know they don't have enough leads. They know they don't have enough dates. They know they are overweight, but they don't know which path to choose to solve. Those get out of that pain and solve those problems right? There are lots of solutions in front of them. James Kemp:, and our and our goal is to educate them about our solution. So they have the opportunity to James Kemp: evolve James Kemp: and ascend. James Kemp: And then there's the core. There's solution aware and desire results. Those are the people that we have as clients. James Kemp: So they spend much larger amounts. They stay for a lot longer because they are James Kemp: very problem, aware of what they need to solve. James Kemp: And you help them become problem aware. and the very solution, aware that they're aligned with your particular solution. James Kemp: And then there's a transformation. . I've had clients and partners and relationships that that span a decade or more right. They are very, very few people in the marketplace to do that. These are the people that my world a license I mentor, I partner with them. I have Equity or Jvs or these people. James Kemp: But when you understand power laws in the marketplace, it removes a lot of fear and a lot of scarcity, and just understanding that not everybody is going to move to the next stage. Not everybody James Kemp: should move to the next stage and come into your inner circle. And the piece about the the primary thing about running the highly efficient offer driven business James Kemp: is that it's not for everybody, and people are always at the right stage. James Kemp: What I can say is, there are people in your audience and leads and customers that will happily pay you 50 times what others will. You just need the right offer to enable them to do so? James Kemp: So in a power and a power law offer driven environment. We're making offers. And we when people settle where they settle. James Kemp: So James Kemp: that's fine in terms of the, the philosophy and the theory. But how do we do it? So James Kemp: we're going to plot a straight line to a million dollars. And we're going to work James Kemp: along 2 dimensions. The first one is the order of work that we have to do, and the second one is the order of application that people must go through to get there. James Kemp: So pricing is both an art and a science. James Kemp: To get to a million in one year, you need to average $83,333 in revenue every month. You have 2 tiers and your client offer. James Kemp: and I'm throwing a lot of lingo at you. Don't forget you get this document, and you can decipher these, that as you go along, a lot of you send it to folks will be familiar, I guess less so. James Kemp: but that you have 2 tiers in your client offer. You have a tier one. You have a community offer. and on tier 2 you have consulting

. You have 2 tiers and your client offer. James Kemp: and I'm throwing a lot of lingo at you. Don't forget you get this document, and you can decipher these, that as you go along, a lot of you send it to folks will be familiar, I guess less so. James Kemp: but that you have 2 tiers in your client offer. You have a tier one. You have a community offer. and on tier 2 you have consulting. James Kemp: If you have 15 tier, 2 clients, an average 600 bucks a week that generates just over 38 grand a month. James Kemp: If you have 50 tier, one clients on average, a hundred $50 a week James Kemp: that generates 32,000 in revenue. James Kemp: So your total monthly revenue. at 70,000 from clients just requires signing 1.2 5 clients per week. So when you break it down, it's not that scary. If you sell 30 customer offers at a hundred dollars a week. James Kemp: and Gen. You generate another almost 13 grand. James Kemp: and you're over that number only 4%. Of your customers need to convert to clients to hit your numbers James Kemp: in my world. That's between 11 or 15. So 11 and 15% of people who buy my customer office end up becoming clients to some degree. James Kemp: So we choose pricing that maximizes conversions and economics. James Kemp: And James Kemp: I debated this, shall I give you ranges? Shall I, then? And I'm just gonna give you James Kemp: the numbers if that's okay with you. Because I got 5 years of data behind this, and I'm just going to give you the shortcut. James Kemp: So a community offer James Kemp: at one to $200 a week and a 3 K. Paid in full for the year. We'll work with the widest range of markets. James Kemp: I've seen that work over and over and over again in multiple markets and multiple vertical calls and multiple categories, multiple affordability. B, 2 BB to C, James Kemp: and consulting offers at 3 to 600. Sell to the right people in the right ratios. James Kemp: . So those people who want more help from you personally James Kemp: that sells in the right ratios again, in multiple markets. James Kemp: multiple modalities and multiple verticals. James Kemp: So James Kemp: if your $100 customer offer converts 5 5 to 15 cent of bias into clients. James Kemp: This is the path of least resistance. James Kemp: So if it's okay with you, we got some pricing. James Kemp: You can charge higher prices. James Kemp: You can use sevens and nines and angel numbers, and it's more likely to divert you from the path and keep you on it. James Kemp: because the creativity is better better deployed into products into your clients. James Kemp: So James Kemp: let's stick to the prescription, and then you can experiment after you follow the simple path. James Kemp: So to hit a million. It is critical. We attack in the right order. So this is what we are doing together over the next 3 days. James Kemp: So the common approach is to work forwards from marketing to sales, to offer people go I. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it

. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it. Then you need to decipher all those variables, and most people fail James Kemp: because they're being sold to by marketers whose default choice is marketing. James Kemp: and the best way to head a goal is not to work towards it is to work backwards from it James Kemp: because working fords is chaotic because there's so many potential variables, there's hundreds of ways to market and lot of them work. There's hundreds of ways to sell and a lot of them work. James Kemp: But working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage. James Kemp: because over a long enough time period and everybody's tried that we all have both approaches, get you to the goal, but working backwards, gets you there faster and with more certainty. James Kemp: So we're going to do 3 things James Kemp: we're going to create and validate a threek offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc. And that's what we're going to focus on today. James Kemp: We're going to create and sell a customer offer that converts 5% of its buyers into clients for you James Kemp: in that offer that we've just defined. James Kemp: Then we're going to automate the lead flow and the customer offer and Nsn. Customers into clients every week. James Kemp: So we go from making 3 K. And validating that to 3 KA week to 3 KA day. James Kemp: So we use 3 systems to do this. The hybrid offer James Kemp: which I'll talk about today, customers to clients and the daily client machine. James Kemp: The sequence is very, very, very, very important. because each of these systems solve for a specific stage. and we've got a master one before moving to the next one. James Kemp: and that's the right pace. James Kemp: Right? You may be at different stages, and everybody here is at different stages of the current offer of the marketing of the flow. James Kemp: But skipping steps is not speed. I constantly go back and reevaluate my offer based on feedback. James Kemp: One of the reasons that we use Google Docs is because it's dynamic, right? You can put it on the sales page. And those things later. Once you have something that converts at 30 to 40, James Kemp: but it's dynamic. I'm tweaking words. I'm tweaking, positioning all the time. James Kemp: so skipping steps is not speed. It sometimes feels it. I can just jump straight to marketing. I need more leads, so I can just jump jump to that. But it's just skipping steps. James Kemp: So mastery and the sequence compounds. The better your hybrid offer. The more clients you convert. the better your customers to client system, the more customers and clients you generate. and the better your daily client machine, the more leads turn into customers who turn into clients and and it compounds in action. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate

. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate. If you, if you're writing, marketing and messaging organically, or if you move to ads and then add start working, it doesn't add to just amplification of good content. But good content is created from good messaging, which is, which is created from good office. James Kemp: So I need you to understand the sequence, because the sequence is what delays most people because they work front to back, whereas we were back to front. James Kemp: So let's get into the hybrid offer. James Kemp: So traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for durations. James Kemp: It's simple, but it's just easier than simple. That's why the majority use it right? So the hybrid addresses this by selling a rock across a range of prices and times with a single offer. James Kemp: Simplicity is having one offer. and you only need one offer. James Kemp: and there is a useful distinction between offers and products is really made. You need a lot of ways to make the offer. James Kemp: But you don't need many products, and you don't need many actual offers. So hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it. So we sign them up for an ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes and timelines along the duration. James Kemp: Before we get to that James Kemp: we've got to define. Why, people buy. And again, the more variables that you insert here, the longer it takes to get results. James Kemp: But there are 4 core reasons. People buy help James Kemp: to make more money to save money, to stay legal or live a better life. James Kemp:, and the majority of people that sit in the make more money all have a better life. buckets James Kemp: stay legal as compliance, and some of those and some of those are real blue oceans because people really need them., and save money is a different market altogether. But saving money can be a, a core benefit of people who often save people. Time James Kemp: you only solve for one core James Kemp: and all the other benefits that are are exactly that they are benefits. James Kemp: So there's a huge difference between these 2 businesses. You help business owners build systems free up time so they can make more money. You help business owners build systems to make more money, so they can have more time. James Kemp: Both businesses do the same thing. James Kemp: The functional things they do but are the same. Yet both companies will attract a very different type of customer. James Kemp: because one is seeking a better life. and it's in a different stage usually, and one is seeking more money. James Kemp: And if you offer both James Kemp: as your core benefit. Both you and your client will be confused. James Kemp: and we see this all the time. That direct, that getting away from the core and talking about all the benefits. James Kemp: confuses you and confuses the market. Right? So personally, I solve for making money. James Kemp: and the stem of that is from one of my core beliefs that true freedom is downstream from from financial freedom. James Kemp: So the core piece about me and my orientation towards the market is making money
