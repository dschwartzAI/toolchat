- ```txt ## The Universe Rewards Energy Stewards **Summary:** The universe rewards those who effectively manage and amplify energy. By believing in the universe's support and acting as a conduit for energy, individuals can attract abundance in various forms. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Everything in the universe is energy. This central belief has helped me more than any other, because I believe the universe has my back. It will give me more than I can imagine if I create and distribute energy in all forms. It's a simple belief: if I create and distribute energy, the universe will reward me with more energy in different forms. I am content because I make others feel content. I am rich because I make others rich. I am safe because I make others feel safe. I receive generously because I give generously. I'm an energetic being, and if I give and create energy to other energetic beings, then I will receive back energy in different forms. Why would the universe choose to give me anything other than abundance if I'm the perfect steward and creator of energy? The universe is going to give me more energy to let it flow through me. I make a lot of money because I also give away a lot of money. I am highly creative because I give away a lot of that creativity and allow space for more, and I'm rewarded with more creativity because I allow these things to flow through me. I steward them, I create them, I amplify them, and the universe has given me more of them. If you feel this divine entity that we live in, the universe, has your back, then anxiety feels pointless, useless, short-term, petty. It feels dishonorable and unworthy of your place in the universe, of the energetic being that you are. Feeling it becomes an insult to the plan. Cultivating this mindset doesn't take long when you believe in the idea of a benevolent universe. Some of the emotions people hold so tightly just look inconsequential, almost pitiful to me when I think about where we all sit in the grand design. ## Overcoming Worry, Fatigue, Indecision, and Frustration **Summary:** Worry, fatigue, indecision, and frustration are signals from your potential self urging you to change. By flipping these negative states into their positive counterparts – courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease – you align with your potential and the universe's flow. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** On a human plane, we dismiss worry, fatigue, indecision, and frustration as just part of life. But on a different timeline, they don't exist. If you are visited by these emotions, they are signals from your potential self to change. Your potential self, on the other timeline, is sending you signals, saying you are in a state you do not have to accept because I exist in this other state. When these negative states arrive, individually or together, step into the opposite state that exists on the potential timeline: courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease. This is the daily practice. When you feel any of those four, you can flip the script in the moment because that is already available to you on the other timeline. The flip is instantaneous because you already know, and it's already there. It's just the choice to flip it. The skill is the practice of flipping those when they arrive. You've already decided that the universe has your back, so it's dishonorable to sit in those negative places because the universe wants to reward you and rebalance. The universe is also dealing with all the other energetic beings who sit in those states all the time, and it says we need to rewrite the balance. We need to flip the script here. We need to rebalance by flipping this energetic being into one of these four states, or all of them at once. The universe wants to do that because it seeks balance

. The universe is also dealing with all the other energetic beings who sit in those states all the time, and it says we need to rewrite the balance. We need to flip the script here. We need to rebalance by flipping this energetic being into one of these four states, or all of them at once. The universe wants to do that because it seeks balance. It is doing it a disservice to inhabit a negative state. You're blocking its gifts. ## The Power of Belief and the Illusion of Truth **Summary:** What you believe is more important than what is objectively true. By believing in a benevolent universe and your role as a creator and distributor of energy, you create your own truth and attract the corresponding results. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Plenty of other people are going to inhabit negative states, so the universe wants to flip the script; it wants to reach balance. You cannot be wrong or misaligned if you operate from positive states. The universe will balance it out for you. Even if you make a perceived objectively wrong decision, that wrong decision will be made right if you stay in a positive state. The wrong decision will be made wrong if you make a decision from a state of decisiveness and then flip back to indecision. People flip between the states they're in. They flip between indecision and decision. They make a decision, then they flip back to indecision. So the universe doesn't make the decision right because they flip back to the other state. If you maintain the state of decisiveness, the universe just balances it out and rewards it. If you flip back to the indecisive state, then the universe flips it back and makes the previous decisive state wrong because it gives you evidence that it was previously wrong. The art is staying in the state of courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease as much as you can, and the universe will come back and reward those states. Operating from those states is natural; it puts you at one with the universe, in the flow. Then the only tension is external. ## Controlling the Mind and Surrendering to Knowing **Summary:** The mind needs to be right, so control it to define what "right" means for you. Surrender to your inner knowing, embrace the universe's support, and understand your potential exists on a different timeline, already realized. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** These concepts are great on a theoretical level, but they're difficult on a human level because of external sources and beliefs. If you don't believe that you already know, then you are right, and you'll block it. If you don't believe in a benevolent universe, then you are right, and it will give you that truth to prove you are right, that the universe doesn't have your back and wants to punish you. If you believe the current state is the only state you can operate in, that there isn't another state to flip to, then you are right, too. This is the central paradox: the mind needs to be right. So we must control the mind and ultimately control the spirit to enable what right means for us. Surrendering to the knowing that you already have within you and embracing that the universe has your back, understanding that the potential you have lives on another timeline, already there – these beliefs ultimately become true. This has been true for me and for the people I've helped install these ideas in their lives because they sit in a level of flow, which means the day-to-day things that previously stressed them out no longer do. ## Removing Need and Embracing the Abundance Mindset **Summary:** By removing need and not relying on external sources for validation or sustenance, you become a magnet for others seeking to fulfill their needs through you. This abundance mindset fosters genuine giving without expectation of return. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Removing need works better for males than females

. ## Removing Need and Embracing the Abundance Mindset **Summary:** By removing need and not relying on external sources for validation or sustenance, you become a magnet for others seeking to fulfill their needs through you. This abundance mindset fosters genuine giving without expectation of return. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Removing need works better for males than females. It means you don't need any external sources of energy or sustenance. You are your own being, and you don't need anything whatsoever. If you maintain that state, you will find that people will try and fulfill their needs through you. I get so many messages, emails, and long diatribes with people wanting stuff from me. I try to explain to them that it's because I don't really ask for anything and I don't profess any needs. I do not need anything from anybody ever. When needs pop up, I either deal with them myself or ask those close to me to help me fulfill those things. I got very good at asking, very good at receiving. Removing need helps, especially in an industry full of needy people. Many get into the expert industry to try and self-actualize, and they do it through the root of getting money, clients, prestige, and status. If you do it because you love the game, because it's fun, because you're giving energy back to the world, then you get much more of those things than anybody else, usually by many orders of magnitude. ## Stop Telling Stories and Embrace the Unknown **Summary:** Intelligent people often overthink and catastrophize potential outcomes. Instead of telling stories about the future, embrace the unknown and focus on controlling your inputs, not predicting the outputs. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Don't tell stories. This is the catastrophizing of all potential future outcomes that many intelligent people do. The more intelligent you are, the more stories you tell because your brain can abstract and posit second and third order consequences. Intelligent people tell the most stories because they believe they can possibly predict the maximum number of outcomes.
