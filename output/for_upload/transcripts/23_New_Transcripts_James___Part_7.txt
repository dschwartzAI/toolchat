# New Transcripts James - Part 7

. So great to see you on this. Great to see you on this call., well, James, let's get into this kind of raw messy format that we, we've obviously perfected after one previous call, this, but, I think we'll be, We're gonna run a workshop on, on messy Catchups. Totally. This is, you guys have all been auto deducted another a hundred dollars. We've auto, we've auto deducted your credit cards. This is an informal workshop., no, I think we'll be a cool place to start is, I would love to hear from you what have been the themes of this year for you so far. We can then go back and forth and play pitch and catch and talk about, the lessons and what's working and what's not, and the pivots. But for you so far in 2025, what has been the vibe? What's been the theme? What's been coming up for you?, two, two big things., clear modalities, being clear about coaching, being clear about consulting, being clear about mentorship and leaning into those, the the distinctions between them, and consumption. And, that getting, getting people, creating an, creating opportunities for people to consume your stuff, whether it's free or paid leads to opportunities. And there are, there are, we can both, we can talk about the ways to do that, but if people consume your stuff, then they know, and trust you and they're likely to do something with you. Yep. And what's, what's been the under the hood feeling for you going into this year? Was it, was it about keep doing what you're doing? Was it about unscrewing yourself on certain decisions and things that? what's been the actual feeling that you've had in your business? There's, there's been quite a lot of tension with me because the, the, the biggest tension for me that has been separating what I need from what the people in my clients and my world need and, and make, trying to make clear distinctions between this is right for me, but I need to communicate clearly that it might not be right for you right now. Yeah. Because the things that I need and the things I want to do, are I'm coming from a different place with different resources and different goals, and I need to ensure that people are doing the right thing at the right stage and not just copying what I'm doing just because I'm doing it and understanding the context about why I'm doing it. So there's been a lot of tension about trying to communicate, this is right for me, but it might not be right for you and this is right for you, but it's it, I'm not doing it right. This is not right for me. Yeah, Totally. That's been, that's been really hard. That's been really difficult for me. Yeah. And what was the, was there any major problem that you were trying to solve from that you created for yourself or experienced in 2024 that you were coming in? obviously that speaks to the modalities and the way that you frame it from a business model perspective, coming into this year, what were the big themes that you were, I need to get away, I need to get back to this, or I need to shift something? I think, I think the biggest thing for me is, coming into, at the end of, at the end of last year, coming into this year, I've got the circle and then we've got the syndicate. And because of the levels of access that I've given people, the lines between those were really blurry and my energy wasn't fully with the cir the people in the circle around coaching and availability, because I was starting to spread it as the, as the syndicate grew

. And because of the levels of access that I've given people, the lines between those were really blurry and my energy wasn't fully with the cir the people in the circle around coaching and availability, because I was starting to spread it as the, as the syndicate grew. So for me, the distinction of saying the syndicate is a mentorship community, I'm gonna give you everything and look over my shoulder, we're gonna talk on the Zoom calls and, and, and I will coach on those calls, but it's, this is the boundary. And then that freed up a lot of energy for me with the guys in the circle who get WhatsApp access and those things. So I can, I can lean in more proactively. So having that distinction for me was being clear to me that these people get this level of access and these people get this level of access. And it also helped people decide that where the right place was and being really comfortable with people, choosing their own journey., a number of people came from the syndicate and just said, listen, I'm not making use of this and I just want the content and I just want to come to a workshop once in a while and I want access to the training and I'm gonna downgrade. And not seeing that as a downgrade and, and just seeing it as someone choosing the lane that they needed to be in. So that Yeah. Yeah. There was the being clear that I, I can allocate, I've only got so much energy to coach people because coaching is, I believe coaching you need to go layers deeper about not just what someone is not doing or what they're gonna do next, but why they won't do it. Why they won't consistently do it, what's really in the way of it. And that requires a relationship and energy and some depth and some time. Yeah. Sounds juicy. IIII think also the bastardization of the coaching word, by, by a whole industry has been super dangerous about people saying that they're a coach. And it, for so much, 90, 90% of what people have been selling for a decade is consulting. It's, do this, do This. Well, it's, it's an info Info, It's a glorified info with chat. GPT support Coaching's way deeper than that. Yeah. It's not the things you do, it's why you do them and why you don't do them. And the human behind the, the machine that's pushing the buttons. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I just leaning into those, those distinctions for me as being super valuable about how and where and who I put energy to and why to have those clear distinctions and, and then allow people to make their own choices. Yep. I love that. Well, I'll share a bit about my start to the year. And for anyone who's just jumping on or wasn't here for the last call, we did this at the end of last year, this as much as you might be tempted to believe is not, James and I just self indulging, having this patting each other on the back. It's really about, it's mostly, it's mostly that, but we, it's, it's, it's 99% there. Let's, to be honest, the, the key is we're gonna go through the things that have worked for us, are working for us, we've made massive mistakes on, and we are changing, rethinking about this year. Our goal is to have you find yourself in some of the things we're sharing. So to go, oh, that's for me, or Oh my goodness, goodness, I was gonna do that. I'm so glad I'm, I'm not, they said that it sucked for them

. Our goal is to have you find yourself in some of the things we're sharing. So to go, oh, that's for me, or Oh my goodness, goodness, I was gonna do that. I'm so glad I'm, I'm not, they said that it sucked for them. Right? So our goal in all of this is to really bring you into our thinking and both the pragmatic changes, the strategic changes, the tactical stuff we've tried, but more than more importantly to bring in, bring you into the how we're thinking. So if you guys have questions as we go through it, I highly recommend dropping them in the chat. And also treat this you're tweeting the Oscars, right? If something really resonates, let's, let's make this an active conversation so that we know that there might be certain threads we wanna pull on or certain direction we wanna go, want to go in, more. So the theme for me this year has been super deep in a work that has manifested in simplification of the model. So hands up for anyone on this call who struggles with a pattern of self abandonment or putting yourself last in a lot of your life. Cool. The delay made me feel I was definitely the only one that had my hand up, in which case that's fine., for me, this has been a huge pattern and there's, we can go so deep on it, but, but if we're just starting at the starting place of this year and what were the thoughts were coming into it, I've spent a lot of my life simply trying to figure out how to be useful to other people at the expense of my soul. And that that can a hundred percent still manifest today with clients where I'll be, well I'll give you an example. Last year I launched this community bond autonomy from which there are people on this community, on this call that are from that community. And there was nothing in me that wanted to launch it from a passion alignment. Something's missing, I wanna do this. It was purely the obligation of, I feel I have to do something for a, a portion of people, of my audience that aren't a fit for what I'm currently doing. And so when I think about business over the last 18 months, it's been this rollercoaster of simplicity to complexity and then back to simplicity. And so the end of 2023, business was so simple and so freaking dialed, man, one offer two tiers of access, 170,000 a month, USD recurring revenue, very simple delivery. And then what happened was at the start of last year, I launched this, this thing called modern autonomy. It added 44,000 a month of recurring in the first seven days. I was, oh my gosh, I'm a wizard. This is amazing. And then everything went down from downhill from there. 'cause it was a separate community, different to my main community. Then when I was sending an email, it's, oh, so which, which offer am I trying to, who, who's this for? Is this for the beginning market or the more advanced market delivery became complex? I went back to my bro scaling ways. We added, all the bells and whistles into this offer. And it took me a long time to realize, I just need to not sell people into that. And we still have 50 something people in there. We're still delivering, there's still calls and, and all of that stuff. But that was a huge lesson of, there was not anything in me that wanted to do that other than I felt obligated and I needed to do that. And that's been a pattern that I've been trying to unlearn

. And it took me a long time to realize, I just need to not sell people into that. And we still have 50 something people in there. We're still delivering, there's still calls and, and all of that stuff. But that was a huge lesson of, there was not anything in me that wanted to do that other than I felt obligated and I needed to do that. And that's been a pattern that I've been trying to unlearn. And so coming into this, this year, couple of key things and and some of you need to write this down and tattle it on your forehead, less but better, less but better. that. That was a huge theme where I was, there was a point where I had a content team and I was posting two times a day across a million platforms and it made me no more money. It just made me stress that I was putting up more s**t content everywhere., because the team just was going for volume and we need to get two reels a day, regardless of if they're any good. And so it's just been less about Bender, just come back to the foundations one, offer two tiers of access, focusing on on, on things YouTube and the mini video sales letter. But it's been much more philosophical than it has been pragmatic. It's been me questioning the way that I think about my business. This core belief. I know that you and I share James, is, your business is supposed to be built around your life, not the other way around. Not you are not here to serve your business. But I, I got caught up in that a little bit in the last year and I was just doing stuff 'cause I thought it was what I needed to do, showing up for clients in a way that I was, this is what clients need. The worst part was, is that I was recreating things or doing things or being a, a dancing monkey waving my hands on camera. Clients weren't asking for that. I just felt the sense of obligation of, oh, I have free time in my calendar. I must need to create something for clients right now. Letting go of that energy of obligation been huge. Can I ask a question just from, 'cause we've got the benefit of hindsight. Yeah. Looking back, what, what signals during that, that decision about modern autonomy and launching that, what signals do you look back on that you should have paid attention to? Oh, it was what come back. It was everything about should I launch this offer was blinking red lights on the dashboard, right? And so I think I straddle this really, really hard tension, which is sometimes you don't know how something's gonna feel until you do it, which is why we are all grand experimenters and scientists trying new things. However, some things are not worth testing. And so I think one of the best decision filters that I have come back to time and time again is by someone I know we both look up to a guy called Derek s Siver who says, if it's not a hell yes, it's a no. And dude, you, I I wasn't exactly running an ex an experiment by launching a community and having 150 people join in seven days. That's a commitment, right? And so I think right away, because I couldn't decide on whether or not to do it, that should have been my decision. 'cause it wasn't a, hell yes. It was this uncomfortable feeling in my body, feeling stressed, sitting in this room. This is an Airbnb, but I happened to be here when I launched Modern Autonomy last year. And I'd be sitting in this room stressing out about this idea of launching this thing

. That's a commitment, right? And so I think right away, because I couldn't decide on whether or not to do it, that should have been my decision. 'cause it wasn't a, hell yes. It was this uncomfortable feeling in my body, feeling stressed, sitting in this room. This is an Airbnb, but I happened to be here when I launched Modern Autonomy last year. And I'd be sitting in this room stressing out about this idea of launching this thing. But because I'd already posted about it and got feedback and built a wait list of 1400 people or something that, there was this obligation of, well, I guess I have to do it now. And I think getting more comfortable with just unapologetically setting standards, setting boundaries, saying This is what I want to do. I don't have to explain this to anyone. I don't have to justify this to anyone. I'm doing this 'cause I want to do it, or I'm not doing this 'cause I don't wanna do it. That I think was the big thing that I was ignoring last year. There was still a very strong, but people need help, man. I, I can be Dan Bolton, I can be people's savior. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go out here. I'm just gonna save the world from bad coaches and bad content and, and poverty. And I'm just telling you right now, the freedom that I've felt this year of just letting go of the idea that I cannot help everyone, nor am I, nor am I meant to try and help everyone or, I'm not even capable of helping Everyone has been very freeing of going, there is a pocket of people somewhere around the world. Those are my people. My job is to sh to put the bat signal up as much as I can through my content. So those people know where to find me. And I think that's been really liberating and also heartbreaking. 'cause you're, man, I just can't help all the people and I can't, I can't be everything to everyone, which I think is a deep temptation than many of us. So that's been a big thing for me this year. Less but better simplification, going back to how decisions feel in my body, all that kinda stuff. Does that change the way you've made decisions or the speed that you make them? Yeah, speed question's. Interesting. Definitely how I make decisions. right now, The, the Dan Bolton that that, that, that I know tells me about one thing in the morning and then he is done it by the afternoon. Yeah, dude, it's interesting. There's certain things I think I've just, I've, I start to weigh the scope of what I'm testing and trying. For example, you have an idea about a certain type of YouTube video. The the risk is so low, you put it out and it sucks. I put out A-V-S-L-A few months ago and it was 42 minutes and it was, s**t, the moment I created it and I uploaded it and it was s**t in results. So, but that's not a irreversible decision. And so I think, I'll give you a really pragmatic example. We are gonna escape New Zealand summer right now. It's stunning., in about a month it'll be less stunning. And so we're trying to weigh up where we're gonna go for a few months as a family and we can't decide, but we are gonna leave some, we are gonna leave to somewhere in four weeks and we have nothing booked. Hmm

. So, but that's not a irreversible decision. And so I think, I'll give you a really pragmatic example. We are gonna escape New Zealand summer right now. It's stunning., in about a month it'll be less stunning. And so we're trying to weigh up where we're gonna go for a few months as a family and we can't decide, but we are gonna leave some, we are gonna leave to somewhere in four weeks and we have nothing booked. Hmm. But I'm allowing myself to feel okay in that feeling of not knowing, because if I go down the rabbit hole of trying to, research every island in Hawaii, or ask chat GBT the best places for our family in Europe, it's really demonstrating. I'm not saying I haven't not done that. I'm just saying I'm not going to make that My only thing, I I'm relaxing in the not knowing of allowing myself to, when I know to move fast, to move fast, and when I don't know what to do, I can sit with it. And allowing myself the familiarity with feeling uncomfortable is a very powerful frame. this, this is worth writing down for some of you who really struggle with specific vices or maybe struggle with creating, chaos in complex in your business. One of the top life coaches in the world, Brooke Castillo, she said something so profound when she was talking about how she overcame drinking. She said, I realized I didn't have an over drinking problem. I had an under feeling problem. And I think many of us are moving lives not towards something, but away from something. We're trying to desperately not feel the thing. And there's a superpower in just being able to feel it and not have to solve it and not have to do something with it. Right? It's today you realize that you're on this call and you realize your business sucks and your clients aren't great. And, but you don't have to burn it to the ground and change everything overnight. You can just allow yourself to feel it. And I think that's been a huge theme for me is allowing myself to feel the discomfort. Because oftentimes I will try and act myself out of discomfort and that will create a misalignment. That's the, that's the the paradox of being someone who takes action, right? Is that you know how to get out of stress, but it's just what stress are you trying to get out of? Because Well also, is the stress possible to get out of right now, You can get the stress of, well, if I just make more money, it'll be fine. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And more and, and more money can compound onto, more obligation. Yeah. And then especially in the, in the, in the gig that we run. Yeah. So let's, let's go back and forth on some of this stuff around we, I don't think there's a a, I don't think there's a list of, let's go through what works and what doesn't and what we're trying, just let's talk about some really key things and narrow in on some stuff that we've observed or that's worked for us really thinking about this first quarter. Does that sound good? Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Cool. Do you wanna start? I've got a list here. Yeah. I think we, we have, we have slightly different philosophies in terms of maybe front end products and those strategic moves, right? And it's interesting to me of a hundred percent of the people who have joined me in, in in Q1, consume something. Yep. 90% consume something through the, through buying something and making the commitment an investment, whether it's $9 or a hundred dollars or $999, it didn't really matter
