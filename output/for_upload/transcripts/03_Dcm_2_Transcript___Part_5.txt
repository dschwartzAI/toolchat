# Dcm 2 Transcript - Part 5

## Q&A: Organic vs. Paid Ad Messaging Shevaune Ray: Yep, Shevaune Ray: congrats to Tom for pronouncing my name correctly. 1st of all. I just had a quick one, and sorry I'm out getting ice cream. I didn't think I'd get on. Shevaune Ray: So you were saying that with paid ads when you started differentiating who you were talking to by saying, coaches versus consultants, that Shevaune Ray: your paid ad spend bent down when you're using these in an organic way, or with your existing audience, did it convert better when you did that as well. James Kemp: No. Shevaune Ray: Okay. James Kemp: But that's self-fulfilling, right? Because the majority of my audience I've already got as James Kemp: self-selected by being those people. Anyway. James Kemp: Yeah, I don't tend to Co. In content. I don't tend to speak to a specific category or identity too much. But in ads, they're showing them to so many different people James Kemp: right? The filter that you go past it is this for me, has to be a lot more explicit and standing out in in most cases. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that's it's something I've been playing with in my Shevaune Ray: wording. And how I speak to people. I it's so all over the place. Sometimes when I'm targeting Shevaune Ray: and I'm not specific, I can convert crazy. Sometimes Shevaune Ray: those saying the same things just doesn't do anything, and I don't know if it's the market, or it's me, or it's how I'm saying it. But I have realized that Shevaune Ray: I need to unbundle my products more because I was doing exactly what you were just talking about, which they solved a problem. Everybody was really happy, but they didn't want to really do more work because it solved it for too long. Shevaune Ray: and then they would go off, and they'd be happy for so long that I was, Well. Shevaune Ray: I'm nurturing you, and I'm talking to you, and I'm trying to sell you more things, and they were just, no, I'm I'm good I'm good now. Shevaune Ray: So I was selling them one high ticket thing, and they were good for a year. And that just doesn't really work for return clients. Shevaune Ray: So I was selling them one high ticket thing, and they were good for a year. And that just doesn't really work for return clients. James Kemp: That's the paradox of some work. Is that James Kemp: doing a good job limits the lifetime value of a client. Shevaune Ray: And ultimately they can't act on Shevaune Ray: all of it, either. They just feel they are, because they have all the information. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, there, in most cases, most people just want relief from how they feel what they're feeling today. James Kemp: That. Shevaune Ray: And that's. James Kemp: And their drive and their will to James Kemp: transcend their current limitations is quite limited. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever

. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever. And then we'll just reach James Kemp: the limitations, but would also be missing out on a ton of people who bought in a different way. James Kemp: And also we would buy, we could run, lead, lead funnels and those things all day long. James Kemp: but would also be missing out on the people who buy via an infopath and buy products and consume them, etc. Etc. And that's their buying style. Shevaune Ray: Chat too. James Kemp: And the I'm looking for things sustainable. I don't want to be building a new funnel. James Kemp: . I don't want to be building a new funnel every year. I want the core laid down, and then just reframing it, and modifying it as it goes along, rather than . Oh, my God! The webinars, died after 6 months, or the lead magnet stopped working after 3. James Kemp: That's exhausting for most people. So we need a, we need a methodology and a philosophy that's got utility. We can add different. James Kemp: We can change the video. We can change the frontier product. But. Shevaune Ray: And that's I do appreciate that. I know. I I told you that I just switched over to go high level and I appreciate that about that system is that you can set it up with multiple entry points, and all you have to change is the workflow. Instead of rewriting the whole thing. If you just want to switch something out. James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah., once, once the James Kemp: once we've got the especially the info funnel working, it's, okay, let's put some more offers on the front because the bumps the same, the membership offers the same, the upsells the same. So you're just changing out the front end. And, products, fatigue markets, fatigue, things change, and on an increasingly. James Kemp: quick basis, right? And James Kemp: AI, and these things will accelerate that because people feel that they've got much deeper, information inside than they probably necessarily have, so they'll make very good products. James Kemp: But because people are buying them, and that's proven and gpts. And these things the people who are selling them are doing very well. James Kemp: but also they're on the back end. They're tough to convert, because you've you've given every everybody, everything they needed. James Kemp: And you've you've got true cannibalization. So yeah, it's the. Shevaune Ray: Are you going to talk more about? Shevaune Ray: Were you gonna talk more about AI in this meeting? James Kemp: Not today. Shevaune Ray: Not today. That was the other call, okay? Shevaune Ray: yeah. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed

. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, there's there's fatigue all over right, because it's the same stuff James Kemp: largely propagated by the same people. James Kemp: And, people have gone around it, and so James Kemp: they've they've come around and come back to the beginning and, well, what now? James Kemp: I still don't have the things I want. I'm still not the person I want to be. I'm still not getting the results. I want to be. What now. Shevaune Ray: And that's I'm trying to tap into that and get my messaging around that exact thing because I've identified it. But it's Shevaune Ray: what part of that gets people to take action and move instead of just making them more depressed and not want to do anything. So that's that's what I've been playing with in your bundling and unbundling video, the client or customers to clients. Shevaune Ray: And the daily client machine has been, I just keep going back to those and saying, Okay, I'm going to Shevaune Ray: found something different in there. I'm going to change this around. I'm going to do that. And I think I'm gonna Shevaune Ray: sit with the templates from this, and really go to town on it. James Kemp: Yeah, when when things are. James Kemp: when things are tough, or you or you think, you're throwing different stuff out there. And it's James Kemp: when things are tough, or you or you think, you're throwing different stuff out there. And it's James Kemp: sometimes working or not working, there's nothing consistent. James Kemp: Then return back to 1st principles, which is, get a customer James Kemp:, what are we in the business of getting customers. James Kemp: But most things are downstream from that. James Kemp: And it. It just so happens that the nature of James Kemp: online marketing and these things which are, under 10 years old. James Kemp: Everybody went to get a high ticket client, and James Kemp: not appreciating that there were a particular set of circumstances where that worked really really well. James Kemp: because we combined high ticket and high margin with high scale and cheap traffic. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that's for me. I was selling Shevaune Ray: a high ticket customer offer. And I thought I had cracked the code. I thought I was doing amazing, because most of my month was free, and I only had to sell 4 people to be making a lot of money. And I was I did it. I figured out the thing. This is the smartest thing ever. No, because as soon as as soon as the market shifts Shevaune Ray: all those leads dry up, and you have to keep selling and selling and selling every month. And where do they go after they work with you? There's nowhere to put them. Shevaune Ray: and they're not in your world. James Kemp: It's hard to sell recurring products when there's no recurring problems. James Kemp: And some people have recurring product problems where they just don't identify them

. And where do they go after they work with you? There's nowhere to put them. Shevaune Ray: and they're not in your world. James Kemp: It's hard to sell recurring products when there's no recurring problems. James Kemp: And some people have recurring product problems where they just don't identify them. James Kemp: whereas other people genuinely don't have recurring problems, and so recurring James Kemp: and building, recurring or building reoccurring things depend on those things reoccurring and James Kemp: and building, recurring or building reoccurring things depend on those things reoccurring and James Kemp: over a long enough timeframe. Most things do but James Kemp: over a short time frame, which is what a lot of people are operating on. They they don't. James Kemp: And so if a client doesn't need you for a year. James Kemp: You have to either deal with that reality. James Kemp: or, work out what, how, how to, how to bridge that across it. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, that was, that was my hardest thing was to turn what I was doing as a 1 time thing into a yearly offer, because I was so associated with doing it faster, doing it all in one thing I give you all the stuff, and that was how I found you. It was a year and a half ago Shevaune Ray: I found you because a coach that I was interviewing with potentially to hire him. Mentioned your work, and I went and looked up your work, and I ended up not hiring him and jumping into your stuff instead. James Kemp: Thank you to whoever. That was James Kemp: one of one of the things that one of the things to think about in terms of time. I was at a mastermind the other weekend and a guy stood up, and he was James Kemp: a presentation of voice coach right? And he worked with Ceos, and he said, I'm trying to sell James Kemp: something that I can do with these people for a year. James Kemp: but they only need me 2 to 3 times a year when they have big presentations, keynotes, and these things. James Kemp: and what we did in real time was, we, separated their immediate needs. James Kemp: and then their consistent long-term needs right. James Kemp: And what he's done is given people a year-long membership. James Kemp: and then across the year they can check in with them and have a 14 day sprints that lead up to his, their keynote, or them or their big event, and, they'll schedule them in, a few months ahead of time. James Kemp: and then across the year they can check in with them and have a 14 day sprints that lead up to his, their keynote, or them or their big event, and, they'll schedule them in, a few months ahead of time. James Kemp: So he's selling James Kemp: a combination, a hybrid of a membership, and coaching James Kemp: across the year and and allowing them to finance it, which increases is revenue per customer, but it also makes it more predictable. James Kemp: So understanding the products we have and the modalities and and getting into the marketplace is, if people don't need us or want us all the time. Then we have to think, okay, what can what baseline access can they get to keep them in my world? And then, when? When do they need me. And and what's the best way to deliver this product? James Kemp: And so thinking in a nonlinear way is useful because most people think in terms of James Kemp: every week. I'm going to do this with clients, and then every month I'm going to do this with clients

James Kemp: And so thinking in a nonlinear way is useful because most people think in terms of James Kemp: every week. I'm going to do this with clients, and then every month I'm going to do this with clients. But James Kemp: most things don't work that some things do right, lead generation, and those things are conducive to monthly rhythms. But a lot of client work James Kemp: sits on this wave where they need you a lot for a few weeks a year. James Kemp: and they don't need you really much at all, but they benefit from being around you, or having access to to those things. Shevaune Ray: Yeah, you said that in one of your trainings, and it blew my mind, and I immediately changed the membership that I have to where Shevaune Ray: they get I do voice notes every day, because that's easy for me. I just have thoughts, and I put them in there. They get modules, and then I just give them calls when they need it. And I was explaining this to my clients that that's how I do it. And they were every single person was, Oh, my God! That's too much! Every person would be calling me. They would all be getting on. They'd all want. Shevaune Ray: what I found is that out of every 100 people you maybe have 20 who are engaged, and of the 20 that are engaged you have 3 that want to get on a call with you. The rest are just happy to pay. Shevaune Ray: just to be there. James Kemp: Yeah, exactly. James Kemp: I think a lot of people just will pay for the knowledge that they can access something when they need it or access someone when they need it. Shevaune Ray: And half the time they don't even access the information. They just sit there. That's been the biggest thing for me is to watch. Shevaune Ray: Once I transitioned over to school, too, so I can see who's watching what and who's using what Shevaune Ray: a lot of people will be in there, and they'll they'll be so excited that you drop new modules, and then they never watch them. But they're still excited, and they talk about. James Kemp: Yep, it's all a it's all understanding. State of preferences and actual preferences right? James Kemp: And what people are buying. James Kemp: Enjoy your ice cream. Shevaune Ray: It's very good ice cream. It's mango and vanilla. James Kemp: Excellent. Shevaune Ray: And then Beta into 12.
