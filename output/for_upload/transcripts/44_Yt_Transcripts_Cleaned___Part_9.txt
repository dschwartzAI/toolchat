# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 9

convert them into prospects yeah so it's it's a bottleneck analysis as the :41 the first major hire if you because the virtual assistant is relatively easy to find you might go through two or three but the biggest thing I see :49 with virtual assistant is the Rel L inexpensive in the world that we're in and people are I don't have enough :54 work for them to do and you're you said the average virtual assistant :00 30 minutes an hour a day you're paying them to sit around for six or seven hours a day if they're full-time dedicated to you yeah but the relative :07 cost of that at 20 to 30 bucks a day is very very low yeah so at the :12 beginning people need to accept that someone sitting on the bench and they're under utilizing them but utilize them in :17 the future but your 30 minutes is worth more than their whole day yeah also delegation is a muscle you build it up :23 another skill everything's a skill oh man when I first got started with a virtual assistant I would be doing :28 things that the virtual citiz should be doing even when I had one because I kept forgetting that I could delegate it now :34 I got I I realized two platforms this morning had my old profile pictures I :39 didn't log in and change them it was a voice message hey can you change my School Community thing and my cly :46 profile photos to the Facebook one thanks now it's just a muscle so a really helpful framework that I :53 remember learning when I was hiring this and building this stupidly big team was from Ari misel and do AR's :00 story no so AR runs this I don't know what he does now but he used to run something called the replaceable founder :08 and his story was he built this business and then he got Crohn's disease and it got only work 1 hour a day so became efficiency productivity machine :15 when you're hiring let's say you figure out the bottleneck right so you look at appointment hitting you're spending too many times and too much :21 time in the DMS you go through this process called o a o optimize automate :28 Outsource right so the key is you optimize first you go is this thing that :34 I'm doing yeah is it important should it be getting done yeah is this :39 a later thing is this now thing all that stuff you filter it through is there a better way that I can be doing this to make it just as impactful :45 and less time all of that stuff automate oh this is a freaking super important question now in the age of AI :52 cuz now you're having things copyrighting and video editing and all those things where it previously it was :57 I need videos edited post a job now it's there is an AI for that that can take your podcast and edit it up and :04 then Outsource and the the point being your first response to overwork or :09 overwhelm should not be I'll go hire someone if you're going to hire someone it should be this refined focused super :16 Crystal Clear role your job is this this is how many hours they think it's going to be and I think the mistake that I've :23 made is right now I'm making more profit with a team of two than when I had a :28 team of 13 yeah and so the idea of you just keep adding people in and we'll figure it out on the way or hiring for :34 growth right is typically a stupid model when you figure out what the botnick is figure out is it a :41 botnick at all or you just going through a busy week then going through o a o o I think is really really key so right now :48 do you have any team at all what one yeah Alex VA right all round VA super :54 superstar cool right now I have a VA and a Content guy what's up sh up and :01 and I'm going

hiring for :34 growth right is typically a stupid model when you figure out what the botnick is figure out is it a :41 botnick at all or you just going through a busy week then going through o a o o I think is really really key so right now :48 do you have any team at all what one yeah Alex VA right all round VA super :54 superstar cool right now I have a VA and a Content guy what's up sh up and :01 and I'm going to be hiring more people soon because we working with an agency we're really scaling up content but the point is is that I wouldn't :07 even need Dylan to stay where I am if I want to stay where I am I could be right there with a VA as well but the point is is that there's the point is is :14 that there's no set team to get to 100K a month because it depends on your model depends on I don't run any ads :20 right now right so so it's also not should I run ads to get to 100K a month it's what's the bottleneck yeah :26 right and so I think team is much the same the only non-negotiable for me is get an assistant because you should not :32 be adding people on Facebook or responding to a support request or following up a billing a failed pay :37 payment those are all the things that are Nob brainers for me everything else is up for grabs I have no doubt I could :43 make more money today if I hired an appointment set and a closer I'm unwilling to do that because I have no :50 appetite for that that doesn't allow with my values I know that if I hired a full-time coach I could get more :57 clients that way because people love oneone coaching I'm just unwilling to do that so it's a question of values when :03 someone's scaling as well when it's less about the the five person team that is :09 the 100K a month blueprint and it's more about what are your values what are you trying to build how many hours what does :15 it look what are you unwilling to do what are you willing to do and then what are your constraints and then based on that high :20 the last thing I want to talk about as we wrap up is when you think about going from 10K a month to 100K a month what :28 are the biggest skill leaps and mindset shifts people need to experience in :34 order to go from six figures to seven figures the biggest skill leap is is :41 generally around offer making an articulation which is which is an the :46 the skill of empathy of putting themselves into the marketplace because at the moment they're selling something :51 that people but if they their market then they get right in there and and so the biggest :56 thing is the empathy the second the second piece of mindset can be largely solved by proximity if you're going :03 if you're going these days on a journey that you've never gone before and you're not in an environment with people who :09 have either done that Journey or on it with you then you're a fool because we can buy the we can buy the speed bumps :16 even free this we can buy ways over the speed bumps that that far :23 exceed the value of our the the outputs we get far exceed the value of the inputs so I think mindset is solved just :30 by proximity because it changes the belief profile because often when you're if you're sarting out from a from a a :37 leap from 10 to 100K you don't believe you can get to 100K right yeah :42 you just think you can and you haven't gone to I will yeah and when you :47 have the I will piece you can get that through going in a community and you walk around and you go to people you're :53 they're not any smarter than

because it changes the belief profile because often when you're if you're sarting out from a from a a :37 leap from 10 to 100K you don't believe you can get to 100K right yeah :42 you just think you can and you haven't gone to I will yeah and when you :47 have the I will piece you can get that through going in a community and you walk around and you go to people you're :53 they're not any smarter than me they're not even better than I am and then you getting in there and you're :58 okay the mindset shifts by being around people who are doing it and have a have a higher belief level than :05 you mindset doesn't change in isolation you you can't just wish your way to I'm going to do this I'm going to :13 do this I'm going to do this you can brute force it but you will exhaust yourself along the journey where if you :19 just get proximity then it changes your mindset because it changes your belief patterns yeah I find the only way to :24 really shift beliefs is to borrow bitter ones it's either education :29 environment or our relationships and so I I think the thing that we have :35 to say on this to anyone who's listening now to help them the most is you and I :41 wouldn't be where we are without mentorship courses being sponges we would say that because we sell that :46 stuff too yeah yeah but but I would I would say it to the extent of mentorship changed my life pre- business :52 when I think back to when I was 10 11 12 and wildly lost as as a guy in a :58 really crazy family it was the 18-year-old 19-year-old guys that :04 were helping me stay on the track and so I don't sell mentorship now cuz it makes money I sell it cuz I believe in it :10 right and you do too ex and I think there's something to be said about the fact that I think people should be :15 self-responsible they shouldn't be looking for Co coach as partners right meaning we're looking for :22 someone to become codependent with us and jump on the trenches and guarantee us results I think that's where we lose :27 our power that's where we get stuck and we get disappointed is because we're looking for someone to step in and say your problems are now my problems that's :33 not how it works but I think we also make a huge mistake where we think :38 we should be a lone wolf or we're or then we're signing up with a mentor but then we're filtering everything they say through us Reinventing and :45 innovating everything and I think there's just something to be said about following someone's advice and listening to it and doing it not blindly but but :54 without so many doubts and cynicism and skepticism the amount of people that are willing to pay for advice :59 they're not willing to take is wild it's it's crazy it's I see the same I see my :07 role as similar to I see my role with my kids yeah right my kids don't listen to :12 a single word I say but they model pretty much everything I do yeah so I'm :17 either going to be a role model or I'm G to be someone whose actions are completely disconnected from their words :23 and many parents are right they're get off your phone kids as they glued to the thing yeah and and I and I see the :29 same role that we have with both the people that we Mentor but also our mentors too that the proximity of those :37 things is modeled M and we learn much more by osmosis of modeling than we do by someone telling us what to :45 what to do yeah and candidly sitting around this table with us and being around us is a hell of a lot :51 better than them watching

[ __ ] but most of the time it's just purely through osmosis by by us being in proximity yeah yeah people didn't know :31 how close we were they would think that we're just two dudes just copying each other's things but what's :37 happening is we are sharing resources and sharing ideas so we're mentoring each other but most of it's unconscious :43 yeah 100% but but though in saying that the amount of times that we've had conversations where we challenged it I :49 remember coming to you end of last year or started this year and I was I'm going to let my team go blah blah feel serious blah you're I've been :54 waiting for this conversation and that's where I think people it's an interesting thing the last thing I'll :00 say on this is people should obviously lean into the level of access they can afford with the right people :06 there are people that Mentor me that I've never met that don't know I exist Brook Castillo right I would pay :11 for time with her though I probably couldn't afford it now she's probably bazillion dollars I have felt :16 mentored by her and she has shifted my thinking through her content yeah but people should pay for the level of :22 access that they can afford good because when you are in proximity with someone :28 there is something so much more powerful than being on the outskirts of you :33 know buying a course is not the same as having a coffee even though the course :39 might have more information than the coffee of a will proximity right we used to say in church culture with :44 leadership more is caught than taught yeah right so it's yes you can sit down and take the notes but sometimes :50 it's just in and around being in someone's environment in someone's proximity or someone's Community just paying for that level of access that you :56 can afford is one of the fastest shortcuts last thing I'm going to say on mind mindset and mind shifting is you :04 want to think about it hiring which is soul for the bottleneck yeah you don't need I don't need motivation :10 so I binged grant card own and ID my lead and Lewis house and all those guys when I was getting started because I need motivation I need the you :17 can do it I'm good man I feel amazing I feel fired up I feel full of vision so :23 I'm not binging personal development stuff these days and that's not to say I won't again yeah the season but it's :29 knowing what I need in the specific season and then thinking about it a medicine cabinet right not just going I :36 should be reading a book A Week why yeah what am I reading on what is this about so people becoming self-aware :42 enough to know what's the deficit is the deficit in my soul is it in my emotions and my character traits is it in my mindset or is it in my business :48 skills and solving for those skills through getting the right mentorship or exposure to education environments is :55 the real unlock to scaling really fast definitely yeah that was a real right there yeah I just want to thank you :01 so much for taking the time dude this is always a joy and we've been going for 2 hours and 10 minutes I think oh I'm :07 going to be L to Pilates I'm I'm about to wet my pants so I appreciate you brother I love you so much and I love :13 doing this journey with you oh that that was way too that was way wider than I thought it's it's the wide angle all :19 right thanks man thanks man Ex-$120M Director Now Makes More Money Working 2 Days a Week as a Consultant (James Kemp Interview) there are certain things that you can give and get that enrich your life in ways that you didn't appreciate a lot of people say they're building a business but what they want is enough cash flow to live

where I was selling selling Financial leads door Todo and then I found this thing called Google and WordPress and started to realize that maybe it was easier to work with your fingers rather than knock on a thousand doors a day on counsil States and in the English winter so did some reps on the door knocking and then and then was selftaught in terms of generating leads that I sold to finance companies unfortunately finance companies stopped buying leads during a a financial crisis and I had to go and get a job and went went into the tech sector and long story short over five years started as a salesperson and work my way up to marketing director of $120 million business where we were we were a group on clone down down there in New Zealand and accumulated that time the itch to get back into into entrepreneurship and take the skills that I'd both built myself but also built in in high volume sales and online sales environments back into helping people do it and then took the traditional coaching Consulting route learned from the best and adapted a lot of those ideas for myself and then really learn in in the mix did did what I taught what I did and and and did what I taught and the last the last few years especially have been the realization that once you've got a set of skills once you've got a basic skill that it's there's a lot of things to chase there's a lot of shiny objects to chase but we have the great privilege nowadays of choosing to build a business around our life rather than our life run a a business and in my younger days it was all about hitting the numbers and and getting the targets and these days it's about having something that I do that fits my skill set that that that ultimately feeds my life rather than the other way around yeah I think that's your you have the skills and the mindset of let's say or horoi or Sam ovens but you choose to play in this some people would call small game but yeah two to three million a year trying to get to 10 with a a tiny team and only doing calls two days a week is your current goal correct me if I'm wrong yeah yeah hey guys just jumping in here to give you a quick word on our sponsor high level before we get GHL! back to the interview if you don't know already high level is the top sales and marketing solution for any business but particularly agency owners or anybody that needs a software product to resell to their existing customer customer base it has everything you need to capture nurture and close leads for marketing clients and the best part is high level believes in not taxing the agencies on its platform so you can get unlimited clients for one low flat monthly fee the best features include a CRM funnel website and email builders course hosting platform robust marketing automation Builder a Consolidated chat stream with WhatsApp email SMS Instagram DMS and Facebook DMS reputation management social media posting tracking and Analytics and so much more and as if that wasn't enough high level is fully white labeled meaning that you can take the platform and put your own brand on the desktop and mobile app and resell it to your industry for whatever price you want what high level has done is brought the bar for starting a software company way lower so normal people you and I can help our clients with an amazingly robust software without paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in development costs I am not kidding when I say hands down high level is my favorite software of all time it has been integral to my success with my agency it helped me increase my CLI Cent's results and retention and I use it every single day for my own business and if you sign up for high level today not only will you get a 30-day free trial which is not available on their website but you'll get all of the bonuses listed at its keen
