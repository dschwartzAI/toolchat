# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 7

by at least 14 to 20% my :23 recurring Revenue proportion is over 80% of monthly Revenue so I'm by all :28 and I'm and I made six figures profit this month M didn't quite make six figures last month but I will this month :34 and by every conceivable metric is going up but it's boring yeah isn't that isn't :41 that weird to say that I felt a couple of times of that grind up of just watching the everything just go up yeah :49 and it i' at a couple of moments I felt frustrated with it that I want to feel :55 that that time I did 100 Grand in a day I want a rush from it yeah it still happens to me yeah cuz I've had 100 :01 Grand day before I had a I've got a striped screenshot to bloody prove it of of 100K coming in right and I was :10 that felt amazing I want that feeling again yeah it's not on any scalability :18 on any business completely irrational but those feelings still come :24 but that doesn't mean we're completely led by our feelings because our feelings will implode our :29 business because sometimes the feeling is this is boring but I but I :34 have been particularly susceptible to that right so I had to share that cuz I'm very proud of myself if we're :40 getting very honest I had to have many conversations earlier in the year when I was a couple of months ahead of you :45 in terms of the new model and you were I'm thinking about doing this I'm think about doing this and I was yeah talk down from the ledge just do :51 this yeah yeah yeah talk down from the ledge f so let's talk about getting clients because we talk about offer pricing model and we can talk about :58 team as well to wrap up to round out the 100K a month yeah what's a team I say that as I'm about to hire four :05 people and I can talk about that as well getting clients hasir evolved and also the fundamentals haven't changed :12 and we need to stand out in a way that we don't look every other coach I remember when I first started :19 selling our coaching offer in 2020 I'd done coaching previous to :24 that but I was mainly running an agency I ran an offer we would get sales calls I was doing the sales calls earlier and :30 I was hey how are you different from XYZ person right super common then :36 we were selling groups and it was the next iteration of our offer and I was how are you different from this other person who's also selling :42 groups now I don't get that question ever yeah right and so there's a :47 marketing content positioning piece that we can talk about here but let's talk about the fundamental pieces :53 of of how you would go about getting to 100K a month if you're making some money :58 and you're trying to scale up your acquisition trying to get enough leads lead nurture conversion how would you :04 think about that right now and let's say someone doesn't have any money to spend on paid ads or they have very little so :10 it's probably going to be organic to start out with what would you suggest platform strategy all of those :16 foundational things yeah so let's make the assumption that everybody's on something y from the beginning they're :22 on they're on some social media some many people on Facebook some are on Instagram some on cocaine maybe :28 all of the above I I believe in terms of when you're talking about if we we I :33 always work backwards towards the market so I always start at offers and then I work backwards towards the marketing :39 because everything you want to happen in the back end is just there's just fractals of what happens in the front so :46 I'm I'm big on the big idea what is that dream outcome that you're taking people towards and

some are on Instagram some on cocaine maybe :28 all of the above I I believe in terms of when you're talking about if we we I :33 always work backwards towards the market so I always start at offers and then I work backwards towards the marketing :39 because everything you want to happen in the back end is just there's just fractals of what happens in the front so :46 I'm I'm big on the big idea what is that dream outcome that you're taking people towards and you're :51 starting to shape that up that you can going over the next 12 months I'm going to take people here because they need to :58 be pre-old on that idea of that before they before they buy anything yeah so I'm I'm big on having a big idea :05 pre-selling the big idea of you're going to become this I've got this concept of a CO Sovereign consultant right how to make a million bucks a year :11 with 50 clients or less it's it's a binary concept you either buy into that or you don't there's no :17 judgment around that yeah so the more I talk about that Concept in the in the platforms of choice that I use the more :24 people start to buy in that that idea and their curiosity leads them down the track what's the Sovereign consultant :29 what are the characteristics how do how do I access different pieces of those so I framing up a big idea is :37 usually around the identity what identity you're helping someone become or if you're truly unique around :43 identity and mechanism what mechanism you're using so big idea :48 unique unique mechanism those are those are proven Concepts and then talk about it and incessantly on the :54 platform that people are paying attention on and then when you get people engaging with that you understand their intent to the point where if :01 you're really at the beginning you need to know why that person liked that post :07 what level of intent was that was that intent it's your grandma showing you support or is that intent of :13 hey I'm picking up what you're putting down this might be worth the conversation yeah so at the beginning you've got the time to tune into the :20 intent signals of how people are interacting with your stuff but you've got to make stuff in the first place :25 yeah and that's where people struggle with content is what do I talk about but and then if you've got that :31 big idea you can pull bits out of it and talk about those the pieces of that big idea as you go along and then :37 understand how people interact with it so it's all about content ads are :43 content organic is content video is content written is content you got to :48 make content on the platform that you're already on that's getting some Traction in a way that is natural to you that is :55 consistent and sustainable yeah you do video I write they they we we're :00 both making a lot of content but we're doing it in different modalities that suit us because we can be consistent y :06 you can make consistent video I can write till the cows come home so one platform y one idea and :16 then and then it's just doing the Reps on the on the content and pulling the ideas and then understanding as people :21 engage and and what intent is behind it and you I could trust you for the the smart stuff I'm going to give people the :26 dumb stuff so firstly you can obviously do make good videos make offo :32 post a tweet so there's a lot of ways to get clients right there's I :37 I'm friends with people who send cold emails yeah and that's not appealing to me not cuz it doesn't work :42 totally works everything works that's the problem yeah yeah but I think there are pros and cons depending on the business you're trying to build and so :48 one of the issues with let's say

dumb stuff so firstly you can obviously do make good videos make offo :32 post a tweet so there's a lot of ways to get clients right there's I :37 I'm friends with people who send cold emails yeah and that's not appealing to me not cuz it doesn't work :42 totally works everything works that's the problem yeah yeah but I think there are pros and cons depending on the business you're trying to build and so :48 one of the issues with let's say you just send 100 cold DS a day totally works and I think it's a great way to :53 it's a great thing to peer alongside creating content the problem is the moment you stop sending the messages is :59 the moment the leads stop coming in yeah as opposed to building an audience that has a connection with you that's an asset that lasts longer than the moment :05 of piece of content you've just created yeah and so I think the thing that we can both agree on is that you need one platform right when people are getting :11 started they shouldn't be doing five different platforms a redistribution strategy I'm posting tweets here and shorts here and Tik toks here one :18 platform my two favorite platforms I'd be interested to know what you think about LinkedIn but I personally Facebook Facebook and Instagram Facebook :25 is so damn easy to start organically you just add people and your audience :30 grows that Instagram much harder to grow organically we're posting two reals a :36 day right now and we I'm getting really decent growth 10 to 20 people a day and then I might be on a :42 podcast and I think I've had a th Facebook Instagram followers in the last month so it's been working well :47 organically but typically the only traction that I see clients consistently get is when they're running ads yeah so :53 if we're talking no budget it's Facebook what do you think about LinkedIn and :58 then how do people choose what platform that they should use all of the platforms work yeah so for me it's :04 always the one that they're already on that they're getting traction on right and I've had a couple of clients recently going I don't think my people :10 are on this platform and walking away from 14k followers on Instagram and you're going I think my :17 people are on LinkedIn it's don't do you it's it's 8020 you're incrementally at it I'm I'm I'm my two :24 platforms are Facebook and email right because I use Facebook to get people onto email where I can make offers yeah :31 that's all and also Facebook's a really good platform in the sense that the :37 people we are trying to reach also spend a lot of time on it as their primary thing so James and I don't feel any :43 smarter when we sit around scrolling the newsfeed but it's easily the opposite :48 it's easily my favorite platform to get started on you post content it's where the majority of if you're talking :54 about volume the most amount of people in any app are on Facebook right even to this day people who don't use Facebook :01 their their screen time would show otherwise everyone is using it in some capacity it has messenger it's great you :07 can post stories you can send messages you can post content on your newsfeed :13 and it's relatively easy to get leads because you just add people and you can go into Facebook groups and you can add :18 people now some of you might be saying well I just want people to track me down and you're great earn that :24 right but in the beginning when you're just starting out you need to you need to pursue the leads to then earn the right to be pursued yeah when it comes :30 to content let's say people are choosing a platform yeah right I think they need to choose the thing that :36 they're Mo they're best at I don't

Facebook groups and you can add :18 people now some of you might be saying well I just want people to track me down and you're great earn that :24 right but in the beginning when you're just starting out you need to you need to pursue the leads to then earn the right to be pursued yeah when it comes :30 to content let's say people are choosing a platform yeah right I think they need to choose the thing that :36 they're Mo they're best at I don't know if and and they can be consistent now yeah ex that's where the results come :42 from so let's talk about that I think a lot of people are I have to write yeah and they hate writing yeah or that :48 I have to make video and they're terrible on camera the the likelihood of you being of you :54 consistently doing something that you hate and you're really bad at is very low damn I tell you what sometimes :00 as see people making videos I'm you've got a face for radio baby stop making videos I see people write and go :06 you need to be on video yeah yeah 100% so it's it's what can you do consistently yeah and then because it :12 all works it all works yeah I I the distinction between Facebook :18 and Linkedin that you have connections on Facebook it is human to to :23 have your connection Twitter Instagram YouTube I'll include Tik Tok I'm not :29 even on T I don't understand it you have followers so on one platform you :34 have connections yeah so you're one step down the down the relationship :40 hierarchy on the others you have followers which is vague levels of interest that people might pay attention :46 to your staff or leave a thumbs down on your YouTube video but Facebook Facebook and Linkedin the m fact that you can :53 have a connection means that you can get traction faster because you are one step closer to developing a :58 relationship and talking to a person whereas on the other on the other one they're following you then you need to :04 understand whether you have a connection and you can start a conversation to have that so you just get traction faster on :10 those platforms because the very nature of the way that you can 100% you've got you you're connecting with John :18 Johnson on Facebook and he has his real photo and he's got pictures of his kids and then you go on Twitter and you've :24 got Surfer guy 79 talking crap and he's got a picture of a cat but my favorite :31 story around this is to understand the difference in the quality of followers the distinction is on Facebook you can never do business with :37 people who have profile pictures of babies dogs or a cars yeah yeah yeah :44 100% so but never to work one of my favorite stories to illustrate this point was a girl had 1

.5 million :49 Tik Tok followers yes and she said she was going to do a meet up in LA she did a meet up no one came and this is also :55 true of Twitter I know plenty of people on Twitter that have more :00 followers than they make dollars per month that's not uncommon that would be the norm that's normal right then for us :06 we've made Millions from thousands of people not tens of thousands not hundreds of thousands singled digit :12 thousands so it's I haven't even maxed out my Facebook friends yeah yeah exactly I'm in the minority in that I've :18 only got two and a half or 3,000 or whatever the number I love it kill a head right how I made but anyway so :25 so it all the all that they all work but I do think they have really obvious pros and cons that's why I do :31 Facebook over Tik Tok it's not that it can't work I had someone Reach Out me the other day he helped people get :37 clients with Tik Tok he had a million of followers he was broke yeah right so it's just different platforms one of the :44 things that I've become really passionate about and I think we would be really similar to this is your platforms are Facebook and and email not just :52 because email is a really cool platform but there's just a distinct well tell tell me really quickly to :59 help it flesh out the the your thinking behind it of the relationship you feel you have with people who read :05 your newsletter or your daily email so don't want to get too scientific but different different :12 platforms and different communication channels have different levels of entropy so if you're posting something :18 on Instagram the life cycle of that is 24 hours MH it's it's :24 there and pretty much gone even if it's in the feed or those things very few things have any life cycle past a few :31 days at the other end of the social spectrum is YouTube we can watch YouTube videos from 5 six 10 years ago and :38 they're still great so they have low they have just low levels of Decay there's still assets there email is a is :45 a unique Channel because it's got pretty low levels of I have people responding today to emails I sent two :51 weeks ago so there's a there's a low level of entropy that doesn't every email adds something to :57 the communication channel it's one of the last private understanding :02 privacy and the private channels that if I send you an email that you're the only person who's reading it whereas :08 in Social we've got this even though the algorithms even though the algorithms are tuned to us we're :14 everybody's seeing it so email's got a personal thing and and and the third thing with email is that you own it yeah :21 which is the unique thing you these days that's less true because people are being deplatformed and those things yeah but largely :28 you own the list you should back it up but but if you have somehow been deplatform from email you've done something really wrong you really you're :35 on a list somewhere yeah and so so why I brought that up is because my preferred is Facebook and YouTube for for me :42 personally and why I that is because even though you can write long on Facebook it just it's a clunkier :47 platform the scroll you write 500 words on Facebook it's just harder to navigate there's ads vying for your :55 attention and so the peering of thinking short form and long form Facebook is amazing for awareness :01 growing your audience engagement having a long form platform for depth connection trust that real sense of :09 personal connection is amazing and so when I started YouTube 5 months ago firstly I knew I should have started it :15 5 years ago that was plan number one and then I joined Sam M's program he's content stupid just run ads and

harder to navigate there's ads vying for your :55 attention and so the peering of thinking short form and long form Facebook is amazing for awareness :01 growing your audience engagement having a long form platform for depth connection trust that real sense of :09 personal connection is amazing and so when I started YouTube 5 months ago firstly I knew I should have started it :15 5 years ago that was plan number one and then I joined Sam M's program he's content stupid just run ads and I was PR of the people :23 and so we did that and then I cired back start of the year and I was I'm going to do this and my business has :28 just gone this since I started creating long form content and it's because people binge it so firstly :36 this is going to be 2 hours by the time we're done there will be some die hards still listening there will also be some :42 die hards who listen to the first one there will also be some die hards that go straight from this one into another one right I'm a high YouTube consumer if :50 I have high screen time it's mainly me listening to to stuff on YouTube and so having something that people can go :55 really deep with you on is a really powerful thing to do the problem with most people is they post lots of content :01 and they wonder why with all of their consistency why there's not this audience being built even if it's :06 building wide it's not going deep because you haven't given them anything to really latch on to so this is why :12 Twitter you have when I see the amount of posts that tweet Twitter people have done cuz it's got the :18 little metric they've got 100,000 followers and they've tweeted 100,000 times I'm my my brain explodes I :26 may have done I may have done a thousand posts on Facebook I have no idea but but my point being you have to follow :32 someone on Twitter for so long to ever consider giveing them $5,000 yeah right and so I really this peering and so :39 however people do it I think whether they do one platform and they post short things and then they do long videos :46 X Twitter we we've been calling it Twitter this whole time we're so we're so old right now so X baby it's :52 going to date this content real so so I think you can have the same effect if you just drop podcasts and YouTube and :58 things that long form on Facebook the point is you should have content consistently right that's short :04 medium long right you can post stor can access easily to binge yes because this characteristic of binging is super :10 interesting to me and I've got a very poorly defined concept around total attention time cuz when I was doing :16 sales calls I always used to hear this thing of just before someone would would jump on a call they're oh :21 used to i i i i binged your content right and then they they turn up the next day and buy stuff right and I've :27 got this theory of total attention time that if there is a if there's a a lump of time that people spend with you :33 intensely over a period of time and that's condensed they they they watch they watch you every day for seven :41 days the the likelihood that that they're going to become a client or reach out to you or take an action on that is multiple times of someone :48 who's watched exactly the same content over 12 months y and you need somewhere that allows that total attention time :55 YouTube allows it it allows people to bench on your stuff email does as well because people can you :02 know sort and categorize things and look for them the other social platforms less so because of algorithms and it you can :08 have profiles and those things but it's not natural for people to go and click on someone's profile and read
