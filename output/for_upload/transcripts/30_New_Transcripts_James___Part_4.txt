# New Transcripts James - Part 4

. James Kemp: So for for most people. James Kemp: The one is enough. Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Caroline Carpenter: One. Okay, so, your next. James Kemp: They've never. They've never experienced Caroline Carpenter: Yeah, I, James Kemp: They've never experienced a. They've experienced a high quality client, but they came and went right Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Yes. Caroline Carpenter: Yes. James Kemp: They've experienced a James Kemp: someone that they want to work with forever. But they can't. They came and went. They don't know how to talk to them again. They don't know. They don't know what they said last time to get that person to work with them, and they don't know James Kemp: how to do it again. They don't know how to replicate a result Caroline Carpenter: Hmm, James Kemp: And so when you, when you talk to certainty. James Kemp: that transference of certainty gives some James Kemp: relief immediately, which is the comfort of the future. Caroline Carpenter: I do have one example that May. Caroline Carpenter: it's going to make crystal clear what you just said. Caroline Carpenter: One of my close proximity clients. Caroline Carpenter: After I had heard this one mechanism, said for the 1st time, I had a referral Caroline Carpenter: that asked me if I had capacity to do what she was asking. Caroline Carpenter: and she was paying me well, and that was huge for her James Kemp: Yeah. Caroline Carpenter: So I don't know how that would translate in something to point at or tangibles. Caroline Carpenter: But the client that James Kemp: It's not, it's not their next client. It's their next soulmate, client. James Kemp: It's been that's cool. James Kemp: IP, client. Caroline Carpenter: So I'm wondering if my verb is just completely off. Then, with a soulful CEO blueprint James Kemp: No! Why would it be off Caroline Carpenter: Well, that would need to be installed first, st I'm wondering where to position. I love that next soulmate client. Caroline Carpenter: How quickly would I position that, or is this where I Caroline Carpenter: just talk about it? Don't put it in the offer. James Kemp: So the the install offer can be James Kemp: Your next soulmate, client, just one, right Caroline Carpenter: And then you have the James Kemp: Tools and the offer, and the positioning and the messaging to attract as many of those as you want. Right James Kemp: So I the frame of building someone an asset. What they do with that asset is up to them. James Kemp: They probably want my help, cultivating that asset, building more assets, etc. But if they don't. James Kemp: that's fine. James Kemp: Going to deliver Caroline Carpenter: So would would that be a customization? Caroline Carpenter: Somewhere in the middle of my 15 week offer Caroline Carpenter: that is going to stay open for the people who stay James Kemp: So if we isolate what we're talking about here in terms of an install offer. The James Kemp: the offer isn't to become a soulful, CEO, etc. James Kemp: It's 1 thing Caroline Carpenter: Okay. It's James Kemp: You, giving them only the tools they need to attract their next soulmate client Caroline Carpenter: Gotcha James Kemp: And then description of that. What is that right? James Kemp: But it's also the description of what they're currently experiencing Caroline Carpenter: Got it James Kemp: Is, you've got clients all over the map James Kemp: doing different things for different people. Some you love. James Kemp: Some

. It's James Kemp: You, giving them only the tools they need to attract their next soulmate client Caroline Carpenter: Gotcha James Kemp: And then description of that. What is that right? James Kemp: But it's also the description of what they're currently experiencing Caroline Carpenter: Got it James Kemp: Is, you've got clients all over the map James Kemp: doing different things for different people. Some you love. James Kemp: Some. You James Kemp: have a a pit in the bottom of your stomach every time your email pings or they message you Caroline Carpenter: awesome. Caroline Carpenter: Okay, I can probably dig more into that to see Caroline Carpenter: so these are short term right. Caroline Carpenter: these are short term install offers that you keep going on in another container that's already been built. Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: You put them into the where the soulful Ceos are, and then they're, oh, there's more work to do. There's more things to do. There's more. James Kemp: there's more path I'm not at. James Kemp:, 10 KA month for 25 clients with 25 clients. I'm not there Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: So there's more opportunity not. There's more work to do, there is. But there's more opportunity Caroline Carpenter: And I don't know what something that would be priced at, but that Caroline Carpenter: might be determined on. What alls Caroline Carpenter: would that be more a I don't want to say a $1,000 offer. That's probably too small. Caroline Carpenter: Guess it would depend on where I'd want to put it James Kemp: Over time. James Kemp: What's it worth to the person Caroline Carpenter: Good point. James Kemp: I can. I can charge. I found charging 10 K. To help someone make 10 K. Very congruent Caroline Carpenter: Rights. Caroline Carpenter: Okay? James Kemp: Especially especially when you're asset building. James Kemp: charging 10 k. To that with an asset that gets an an immediate yield is a ridiculous deal right? James Kemp: Because they get to keep all the upside. After that James Kemp: got it. That initial 10 K. Could turn into a hundred or a million, or whatever, if they do something with it. James Kemp: I. James Kemp: This is where the value equation comes in that that's . James Kemp: if you frame things as building assets, which is what I do James Kemp: Then people have a sense of, okay, this is this is the yield. James Kemp: And anyone who doesn't understand the value in that doesn't fundamentally understand James Kemp: assets return Roi or anything, and they're unlikely to get the result, because if someone thinks that James Kemp: paying 10 K to get 10 k. Back within James Kemp: at 10 K. And the asset back within a few weeks is A is too expensive. James Kemp: They're not going to make it James Kemp:, because they have a very poor understanding of value. Creation yield assets, etc. James Kemp: And, unlike candidly, most people do. Most people have no understanding because they can't understand things over time. James Kemp: and so they just get fixated on what they have now, and they always have that right Caroline Carpenter: This is probably a terrible question. Have you ever had someone Caroline Carpenter: not? Hey? The cause? The way you frame it? It's 5 k. Now. 5 k. Later, and I know you walked through your very specifics. Caroline Carpenter: I don't know Caroline Carpenter: you ever had someone just dupe out on the rest. Or is that more of a I see who you are

. Have you ever had someone Caroline Carpenter: not? Hey? The cause? The way you frame it? It's 5 k. Now. 5 k. Later, and I know you walked through your very specifics. Caroline Carpenter: I don't know Caroline Carpenter: you ever had someone just dupe out on the rest. Or is that more of a I see who you are. You ? Buy a good James Kemp: Definitely Caroline Carpenter: Got that? Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: If if you high converting offers aren't aren't difficult to come, come up with James Kemp: right? They're not. They're not difficult to sell either. James Kemp: And so when you have volume, you're always going to James Kemp: at at scale, you're always gonna have James Kemp: unequal outcomes. You're gonna have people who James Kemp: absolutely crush it. And you're gonna have people who make a couple of payments and then disappear. Or you're gonna have people who are, yeah, this wasn't what you told it was gonna me. It was gonna be because I thought it was going to be much easier. And you're gonna have all of the above James Kemp: right. James Kemp: I've also had people not want to continue and insist on paying me the the second payment. James Kemp: Hey? This was Ama. This was amazing. I don't want to continue in the community. I don't want access to you on the calls, etc, but I'm sending. Tell me where to send the money James Kemp: right? So they honor the agreement. James Kemp: even though they, I'm giving the opportunity to get even more value from it. They decide that they got what they needed, and they're going off and doing it. James Kemp: and and their way or another way. James Kemp: I always come back. But this happens Caroline Carpenter: Oops. Caroline Carpenter: Okay, cool. Caroline Carpenter: Thank you. James Kemp: Shrink it down. James Kemp: Shrink it down to what you can deliver to someone over a period of time Caroline Carpenter: Hmm. James Kemp: Because all all other outcomes will just happen. James Kemp: And the I was speaking to a client privately this week as well as . James Kemp: why do people? Why do so many people stick around for so long in my world? James Kemp: And I because I don't do a lot of the things that you're told to do about retention right? James Kemp: And James Kemp: the only answer I can really come up with is, because I don't need them to, and they they feel that. So it's all about James Kemp: desire and wanting to. James Kemp: It's all about them finding different elements of value from it that aren't just, how much money did you make today. James Kemp: So I'd I James Kemp: don't force people to get value in the way that I want them to see value, which is largely all when things are designed to ascend or retain people as, how much more money are you going to make over a short period of time? James Kemp: I allow people to get different types of value from me and in my world have another coffee. James Kemp: And so the the retention outcome of that is that while I James Kemp: am focused on helping people make money. James Kemp: I'm also James Kemp: very open to how they enjoy that and how they experience it, and what value they get from it, and what value they get to the proximity to me about who I am and the people in that world, and those things James Kemp: which is all to say that James Kemp: that an installer and acquisition offer is focused on a specific result

. James Kemp: I'm also James Kemp: very open to how they enjoy that and how they experience it, and what value they get from it, and what value they get to the proximity to me about who I am and the people in that world, and those things James Kemp: which is all to say that James Kemp: that an installer and acquisition offer is focused on a specific result. James Kemp: but it can have it can be bundled with a lot of benefits that are incidental that are only discovered when we get into motion. James Kemp: What value James Kemp: to come to the calls Jonathan signed up to the install offer a few weeks ago. He's been on my every single syndicate call. He didn't go. I'm joining that because I've I can join the syndicate and those things James Kemp: he's received the benefits from that, and he's experiencing them, etc. And he's making up his own mind about what it's to be in here. Right? James Kemp: So then, if we just focus on being really specific on the install offer. James Kemp: and we include the other pieces as an experience, then it will just it will unfold. James Kemp: Does that make sense Caroline Carpenter: It does so focus on the result. Let them enjoy what they're gonna enjoy and James Kemp: If you get very attached to, I'm going to sell them on this, and then I'm going to keep them forever. And oh, my God, I'm gonna make so much money it will do neither Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: It will, but it James Kemp: it won't deliver the the full spectrum of benefits to both parties, that is, that is available Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Caroline Carpenter: okay. Now, I'm having the conflict of, is it cool that I put my stake in the ground on? Here's what I'm gonna do, and some women are coming with me. But I think that's okay, because I'm not twisting anyone's arm or James Kemp: It's fine. It's I. I enjoy being focused. I enjoy. When someone's James Kemp: I give someone a Google Doc James Kemp: and they go out and they go fucking. James Kemp: Someone bought this is a mind bending experience that I didn't talk to this person. James Kemp: and they sent me a hundred $50, or or those things James Kemp: And when you give someone the experience that's transformation James Kemp: because you don't shift beliefs, the experience does everything you need to then go. James Kemp: Maybe I can do it this way. Maybe it's possible James Kemp: it it introduces some level of faith. James Kemp: Hey, Lana. Lana North: Hello! How are you going James Kemp: Good. Lana North: Good been bubbling away since we spoke about this the other day, and I really think that I've been working on the the change communication recovery accelerator for people. So what I do for context for people is help. Professional leaders who are running change programs to master their communication team engagement so they can deliver the benefits. What? I am Lana North: wondering the the pain point that I'm agitating around is so for a program director who has to go and report to their steering committee, and things are starting to stall or slow down or turn from green to red. That's the pain point that I think is very real for them. What I'm more wondering about is on the Lana North: any recommendations that you have around the Lana North: sales or marketing process before that Lana North: to get people to put up their hand? Because I'm just starting out. I don't have, I have my Linkedin audience, which is 1,100 people. But I don't have a my email list or things that

. That's the pain point that I think is very real for them. What I'm more wondering about is on the Lana North: any recommendations that you have around the Lana North: sales or marketing process before that Lana North: to get people to put up their hand? Because I'm just starting out. I don't have, I have my Linkedin audience, which is 1,100 people. But I don't have a my email list or things that. What would you recommend to get people to put up their hand so that then I can start to have the conversation James Kemp: Yeah. So the the language you just used there was. James Kemp: They're going to the steering committee, and and the project's about to turn from green to red. James Kemp: So there's lots of different ways to message that you could tell a story of projects you've been involved in, that., we're going from green to red, and what happened. James Kemp: and no one likes being chewed out in the in the meeting and etc, etc. And this is the 3rd project that's gone this way. That's, over time and over budget and and all the rest. So there's stories. But the the old pointing finger never fails, which is when you can point to James Kemp: an uncomfortable experience that someone's just had or is about to have. Then you'll have their attention Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: Because they will be attempting not to repeat that, or they will be attempting to avoid that in the future. Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: So all the content that you create is, if your project's about to turn from green to red. James Kemp: we can have a conversation. I can show you how to how to get that back on track in 4 weeks. Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: Because that's an objective measure that is James Kemp: the the most objective measure that you probably have, that there may be others. James Kemp: But that's an objective measure of the experience Lana North: Yeah, I thought in terms of, when we talk about our goal is this is going from orange, orange, or red back to green or staying staying green when it when you're on the cusp of tipping over James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah. And then, over time, you could say, my clients only have green projects. James Kemp:, in terms of communication. And those things that James Kemp: the no more Reds crew is is us. But James Kemp: it's the objective experience that come that that someone has. And we talked about, on the call Lana North: Hmm. James Kemp: The optics inside corporate matter, more than anything. James Kemp: How is the project perceived? To be going is the most important thing. It's much more important than how it's going. But how? What? What picture can you paint for the people that matter which is the people above? You? James Kemp: thing Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: So the the more you can paint a picture of positivity. James Kemp: the in terms of the objective measure, which is, a green project versus a red one. James Kemp: The more engaged they'll be with that Lana North: Yeah, yeah, okay, that'll that'll make sense. So Lana North: in in terms of moving to a bit more of a tactical point of view, it's still doing the same posting outreach to network, and all of that thing. So anything anything else that works really well that Lana North: I should be considering to open the doors or shine the light on James Kemp: With an install offer. The outreach can be pre assumed, which is. James Kemp: hey? I've got. I've got I've got space to get one project back on track. Thanks, Rennie. I've got pro

. So anything anything else that works really well that Lana North: I should be considering to open the doors or shine the light on James Kemp: With an install offer. The outreach can be pre assumed, which is. James Kemp: hey? I've got. I've got I've got space to get one project back on track. Thanks, Rennie. I've got pro. I've got space to get one project back on track in the next 4 weeks. James Kemp: Is your project at red or green at the moment Lana North: Yeah, yeah, cool. James Kemp: Because you can be hyper specific. Lana North: Yep. James Kemp: again. Michael and I talked about this on on Tuesday Syndicate call Going for no. James Kemp: Yes, and the the immediate disqualifier allows us to move on right. James Kemp: And 1 1 of your frustrations over the last 6 months is that long sales cycle that open Lana North: Maybe James Kemp: We'll find budget. We'll do this. I'll get decision maker right Lana North: Yeah, the more you have, the more maybes you have in the system, the more clogged the system is because you have hope. Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: You're they they'll they might. They'll come in Lana North: I'd rather say I'd rather say No, if it's no, and then I'll move James Kemp: Yeah. So you can move on right? James Kemp: So anything that gets a no James Kemp: is just as valuable as getting a yes, because a decision is made Lana North: Yes. Yeah. James Kemp: So binary offers, which the only potential outcome is a yes or a no Lana North: Hmm. James Kemp: There is a not now Lana North: Which is still a no. James Kemp: If, if we own, if we control supply. James Kemp: binary offers will allow a business to to be in flow and in control James Kemp: far more than than offers the initiator. Maybe Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: Because we're we're just switching it on and off and going. I've got 3 spots. James Kemp: but I'm talking to 10 people Lana North: Yep, yeah. Got it cool. That's helpful. Thank you. James Kemp: The toughest the toughest part of that is is that you are setting up to cultivate rejection James Kemp: in the form of nose right. James Kemp: and the common characteristic for people me and and others who trace it back is that James Kemp: I did door to door for 2 years in my own business right. James Kemp: I got a metric shit ton of nose, and I got decondition to them. James Kemp: and that helps me a lot because I can make binary offers and knows they don't. James Kemp: They don't move any emotional needle in me. James Kemp: because I don't. I don't take it as personal rejection Lana North: Yeah, correct attaching my personal meaning to it. James Kemp: That is one of the trade-offs of these type of businesses. James Kemp: right? And, candidly, a lot of people build James Kemp: armor around them in the form of salespeople, and and these and these things to inoculate themselves from rejection. James Kemp: A lot of people build businesses James Kemp: and build the system around them to inoculate themselves from that rejection because they they take it so personally. James Kemp: Every time something happens they're just on this James Kemp: fucking emotional our client left. Oh, my God, I'm useless. James Kemp: What my mom said when I was 5 was right. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Oh, my God! And then, Shut down for 2 days James Kemp: there is
