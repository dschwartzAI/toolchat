# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 5

> "If I do this, then this will happen. If I do this, then this person will think…"
 It turns into a catastrophic whirlwind of ideas and pre-protected future outcomes that are all fiction. “If I do this, then this will happen, and if I do this, then I will lose this, and if I lose that, then I will be broke, and if I am broke my wife will stop loving me, and my kids will think I’m a loser, and then I will…” People can do that in a microsecond because they believe they understand the second and third order consequences of their decisions. My favorite story is, "I don't know," because it's the closest one to the truth that I know. If I do something today, what is the outcome? I don't know. My only story is, "I don't know, but I'm willing to find out." This means I surrender to a benevolent universe, and I'm constantly able to move forward because I surrender to the fact that I cannot predict the future, but I can give to it. ## Normalize Discomfort and Embrace Action **Summary:** Normalize discomfort by repeatedly engaging in activities you perceive as challenging. Think in questions rather than definitive statements, and default to speed by acting quickly on your decisions to build self-esteem. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Normalize discomfort. This requires embracing it, just dissatisfaction. The story we tell about discomfort is usually much worse than the discomfort we experience by taking action. Normalizing discomfort is a superpower, enabling operation in spaces where others can't because they're not used to the stress. Normalizing discomfort is purely doing the things you currently see as hard or difficult repeatedly until they become… not easy, but just boring old reps. Similar to not telling stories is thinking in questions. I notice a lot of people think differently to me because they think in statements that are definitive and create the illusion that they know what is going to happen if they take a certain set of actions. I perpetually think in a state of curiosity: 
> "I don't know what will happen if I do this. I believe this could happen. I wonder what will happen?"
 And then I take the action. I have trained myself to think in questions much more than in definitive statements because that helps me stay in the space of, 
> "I don't know, but I can control the inputs. I just can't control the outputs."

> "I don't know what will happen if I do this. I believe this could happen. I wonder what will happen?"
 And then I take the action. I have trained myself to think in questions much more than in definitive statements because that helps me stay in the space of, 
> "I don't know, but I can control the inputs. I just can't control the outputs."
 Default to speed. If you have cultivated removing need, not telling stories, embracing discomfort, and thinking in questions, the only thing left is to act. Action is the only way we move forward. The longer you take between coming to a decision and applying it, the lower your self-esteem becomes because you're sitting in the void of a lie. You have a knowing, a knowledge, and you're not applying the action. The bigger the gap between those things, the lower your belief that the gap will be closed. The slowest people to act always have the lower self-belief. The fastest people to act always have the higher self-belief because they get into the feedback loop much more quickly. They've surrendered to the fact that they don't know, but they acted, and then the action led to the next action, and then they stack those things together. When you have looked at your beliefs, assessed what you need to do, and then act immediately, your self-belief and self-esteem rise because you've closed the gap between what is true for you. If you don't close the gap, then you're operating in the void, which is, "I know these things, but I'm not acting on them," and then your belief in future action will diminish. ## Embracing Your Rightness and Choosing Empowering Beliefs **Summary:** Everyone's beliefs are right for them. The key is to choose beliefs that empower you and align with a supportive universe, leading to a rewarding experience of rightness. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** The biggest challenge with mindset stuff is that you are always right. All the things you believe, by nature, are right. People spend their whole lives arguing about right and wrong, but your beliefs are ultimately right, and then you act in validation of those all the time. Everybody's right. The art is choosing the set of beliefs that you operate under that enable the rightness to be rewarded. Without a belief that the universe has your back, it's pretty difficult to get my point. ## Anxiety, Momentum, and Trusting the Universe **Summary:** Anxiety often arises when we slow down and overthink our current position instead of focusing on our direction. Trusting the universe and maintaining momentum are key antidotes to anxiety. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** I really this, and it… I turned up late today because it was the perfect timing for me, because I feel I've been getting lately really quite anxious every now and then. It's really interesting, looking at everything that you've said here versus when I seem to feel it. I seem to feel this anxiousness around business when I… you've said it to me before, when I slow down too much to the current space, and I… and I start to look too much at… this is good… it's hard to put it into words, but where I am now as opposed to where I'm going. Then I start to overthink everything, and I start to feel lost. Usually the antidote to that is, as you always say, it's getting back into momentum. It's weird, because sometimes… I guess this is the believing that the universe has your back. I guess that in that state of anxiousness, I start to think,

> "Shit, what if just getting back into momentum won't be enough this time? It's been enough these other times, but I'm, 'Fuck, what if it's not going to be now?'"
 And then I start to overthink, and that slows me down from getting back into momentum. It's very strange, but this has been a great reminder, because I'm slightly in that state now of just… everything seems to work when I don't do a lot of the things I used to do, and I just focus on moving forwards and staying in momentum and focusing on where I'm going. ## Overcoming Anxiety and Seeing the Board **Summary:** Overcoming anxiety can initially feel unsettling, but it ultimately unlocks a greater capacity to see the path forward and make the right moves, trusting in the flow of the universe. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Up until three years ago, I lived in a pretty much perpetual state of anxiety, to a low level or to a high level. When I started to unpack some of this stuff and some of these ideas for myself and operate in that state of removing anxiety and really thinking about what it was, rather than a mental thing or a chemical thing, or whatever, some pathology of it… the first experiences of not having anxiety made me anxious because I was anxious that I didn't have anxiety anymore. It perpetuated for a little bit longer because then I was, 
> "But this is a thing that everybody else has and everybody else does, and then I removed it."

And then I started to wonder why I didn't have any of it anymore. But then when I was on that plane, I had this level of capacity and being able to see the board in front of me that I've never had. I knew the next move. In the last few years, a lot of people have asked me, "Who's your mentor? Who are you getting coached by?" Most of those things have been very specific or spasmodic because I am… because I can see the board in front of me. I know the next move, even if I don't know what it is. I know it's there, and I know it comes. The removal of anxiety is that peeling back of… all the moves are there, and they… I can see all the concurrent timelines on how they go, and I just decide and choose, and I operate in that state. The transition from having consistent, constant anxiety… and again, we shouldn't judge any of these things, because there are our own personal semantic definitions of them. Some people have debilitating what they call anxiety, and other people just sit there with a low level of it and are not even aware of it, and it drives them. That judgment of what it is is pointless, but the removal of it allows you to tap into the flow, which says all the moves are right there, and the surrender to them, and there is no wrongness in any of it. There is no worry. There is no central thing that is catastrophic that will go wrong. ## The Body as a Supercomputer and the Importance of Raw Materials **Summary:** Our bodies function optimally when provided with the right inputs, including proper nutrition, sleep, and awareness. This allows our minds to operate at their best and align with our authentic selves. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** This resonates so much, and I would love to add a thought. My opinion is that, yes, to all that you said, and also the understanding that our body is a supercomputer and therefore it operates best when it's given the right raw material. So energy and, yes, active participants to be carrying for our mind and body. I hear you saying, though, and that might just be the story that I'm telling myself, so therefore it's true for me, because I hear you saying, not operate from a need. But what I was going to say is things the right food sources, the right amount of sleep, the right amount of awareness gives our body the raw material it needs to function at its best. So then our brain operates at its best. I love… I want to offer another analogy. Daniel Priestley gives the analogy of the David, and I had never heard that story before, but the way he says it in the 10x Is Greater Than 2x is that the creation of the David was the removal of everything that was not the David. I think when we look at us as humans, I feel sometimes it is this journey of removing everything that is not authentically true to who we are, because, I agree, I think we innately know, when we give ourselves space to be present with it, who we are called to be. We go through a process of remembering and clarifying and seeing who that is and letting go of everything that isn't part of it. ## The Light Touch of Holding Results and Avoiding Tight Grip **Summary:** Holding results too tightly, especially financial ones, can lead to their loss. A light touch and trust in the universe's balancing act are crucial for achieving desired outcomes. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** Someone said to someone the other day on a private call about their holding tightness of results, their results being money. Money particularly is sand in your hand. The harder you squeeze it, the more it leaks between the fingers and disappears

[expletive]. ## Avoiding Dogma and Embracing Individuality in Practices **Summary:** Prescriptive approaches to energy sources diet and exercise should be avoided in favor of individualized practices. What works for one person may not work for another, and even seemingly negative experiences can fuel creativity. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** I tend to stay away from prescriptions around energetic sources diet or exercise because they're very personal. I predominantly stay away from dogma in those categories because there are lots of things that I've discovered that don't fit into a traditional view. For example, I've had some of the best ideas ever and acted on them when I've had the most horrendous hangovers that a human can ever have. I think hardcore sleep deprivation is one of the greatest creative fuels, used sparingly. But once in a while, that's available to anybody. You just can't do it all the time. The stimulus and the season matter a lot. That's why I don't buy into a lot of good/bad binaries around a lot of health and a lot of the pieces. They're all useful. Drugs, they've all got a place for the individual in the season or the stimulus, or they don't because, equally, many of those things that I say will work for me will harm somebody else. ## The Value of Ancient Wisdom and Personal Application **Summary:** Explore ancient texts religious scriptures and the Tao Te Ching for wisdom about flow and the universe's workings. Apply these teachings to your life and distill them for personal relevance. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** I believe it's really useful to read one of the major religious texts and have one. I've got a copy of all the major religious texts. I read the Bible pretty frequently. I think it's an amazing source of wisdom. I believe in God, not the God that's mentioned and not the God that Christianity identifies with. I believe in God, but I believe in *a* God. I believe in God, not *our* God. In terms of my understanding bridging to application, the Tao Te Ching was probably the most helpful in terms of talking about flow and talking about how the universe wants to operate and how it does. Anything that's old and has stood the test of time is worth applying. All of my discoveries are through consuming really old wisdom and then applying it and then distilling it. I'll come across stuff that matches my belief because someone's come to the same conclusion as me, when I first read Reality Transurfing. I was, 
> "Oh,

He talks about lucid dreaming and some other stuff that I'm not familiar with and haven't practiced. But I will read these things, and then I'm, "Oh, this validates my worldview," and I go, "Oh, well, okay, this applies to me." I then avoid it because I don't want… I don't need and want to be right on this stuff. I just need to know what the application is for me. So everything that I tap here is ancient. ## The Power of Stillness and Unfiltered Knowing **Summary:** Doing absolutely nothing and sitting in stillness for extended periods can lead to profound insights and a deeper connection with unfiltered knowledge that arises from within. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** The other recommendation, and I've done this twice, is doing absolutely nothing, sitting in one spot for one to two hours a day for about two months. The best book you'll ever read. nothing. No computer. Just sit there with a notepad. For me, after about 35 minutes, stuff starts coming where you cannot consciously identify where it comes from. This is where I talk about the knowing that just comes up into your consciousness unfiltered. It will either catch you… it will probably initiate a lot of emotion. It could be… I've heard of people, and I had a couple of experiences with it, where it was almost psychedelic, almost visual to a level of seeing things. It's interesting. Something is coming up and through that we don't allow to come through because we have stacked so much stuff around us. Even the thought of sitting there for an hour in a chair with no interruptions seems mentally punishing. I've tried meditation and all those things for long periods of time, and none of them worked for me. But just honestly sitting there for an hour or one to two hours changed a lot. ## The Daily Practice: Flipping Negative States **Summary:** Instead of rigid routines, focus on a daily practice of immediately flipping negative emotional states – worry, fatigue, indecision, frustration – into their positive counterparts. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** What has never worked for me is having a daily practice. I tried everything. What has never worked for me is having this, "I'm going to do this for 30 minutes," or "I'm going to do this for that," apart from sitting there and doing absolutely nothing, which was a practice in itself. The idea that I was going to journal for a certain amount of time and do this meditation for 20 minutes, those things never worked for me. It wasn't until my daily practice of isolating and identifying predominantly those four states and making the daily practice of turning them around immediately that that daily practice started to pay dividends and move forward. They're 24/7 of turning around any worry or any indecisiveness and practicing the flip of all those as quickly as possible. ## From Fatigue to Energy: Fake It Till You Make It **Summary:** Combat fatigue by "faking" energy and engaging in movement. This creates evidence of your inherent energy and disproves the belief that you lack it. Video Source:* sovereign mindset.txt **Content:** What's my flip for fatigue to energy? Honestly, deciding… the thing that I will fake it till I make it is energy because I've found with the things that I find important, I always have enough energy for those things. If I go, "I'm tired," those things might be objectively true, but I've got the energy to do the things that I find important. So with fatigue, my true "fake it until you make it" thing is, "Get my body up, do the thing." I make energy through movement. If I'm low energy, I'll go sit on the bike for 20 minutes, and I'll make energy, which is just breaking the belief of the idea that I lack any

- ## Creating a $100k Community: Product and Offer Strategy **Summary:** This session focuses on creating a community-based offer that generates $100k in revenue. James Kemp emphasizes the importance of clear promises, actionable plans, and strategic pricing tiers to maximize both client acquisition and revenue generation. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Morning peeps. I need to take a stance on these otters and the rooms. You end up interacting with otters and AI pilots more than you do with humans. I've got a doc for you as usual. Bear with me on resolution. So, $100k community, today we're going to talk about product and offer. I want to direct us more towards doing in these things rather than, dare I say, mental masturbation. The philosophy is important, but that's consumed by the learning and the doing. Today is about product and offer, next week, validating it with the founding members frame. Week 3 is next steps. Even those with existing community offers could do with sharpening. Results are always relative. How fast you get results comes from what you already have, and what work you're about to do. Sales are a product of 3 factors: audience (60%), offer (30%), and copy (10%). The audience is a product of what you've done before. The offer is how clear, relevant, and timely it is. Clarity is what promises it makes, relevance is how relevant that promise is right now, and timing can leverage trends. Copy is just the words you use. A receptive audience and a clear offer will take you 90% of the way there quickly. Your offer is your offer, relational to your marketplace and audience. Why community? Four reasons: monetizing an audience (most of your audience hasn't bought from you), a home for your stuff (reduces decision fatigue), ascending clients (easy start point), and taking prospects off the market. Economics: our goal is $100k from a community. In the sovereign system, we have clients, customers, and leads. We get leads, turn them into customers, and turn customers into clients. Some people will pay 50 times more than others. Economics comes from paying in full for 12 months and clients signing into higher tiers. The path to $100k is unlikely to be 20 people at $100/week. It's likely to be a mix: some at $100/week, some paying $3k for 12 months upfront, and some at a higher tier ($300/week). If you have a big audience, a straight community level can work. But to maximize revenue, a higher tier is essential. A community has 3 components: content, the community itself, and customization. The simplest model is tier one ($100/week) with a training portal, community platform, and customization (group calls). Tier 2 is for those who want to go faster, including done-for-you components. If you have an existing high-ticket program, insert the community below it. The community offer is 12 months. ## Defining Your Core Offer and Crafting Compelling Promises **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of focusing on a single core benefit in your offer. James explains how to articulate the promise and plan of your offer to resonate with your target audience and drive conversions. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Four reasons people buy: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Everything outside the core reason is a benefit. I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. Your core piece stems from your own beliefs. While I say a lot of things, I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. As you get more experienced, you deliver more benefits

> "I want your support in getting offers pumping out cash without me having to crank the handle myself. Our goal is building a $3k offer that you take to $3k per week clockwork."
 The plan: 
> "We will install the sovereign system, talk about the client offer, customer offers, and then install the daily client machine."
 The promise, the plan, and the phases. This offer lives and dies on this page. Everything else is logistics. Price is relevant to value. $100/week. What's the risk? Weekly frame, come in, can leave. I choose no guarantees, promises, or refunds. Guarantees are a product of trust perception. The more track record you have, the less you need a guarantee. ## Maximizing Community Economics and the Hybrid Offer Approach **Summary:** James discusses strategies for maximizing community revenue, including offering annual payments with bonuses and utilizing the hybrid offer model to present multiple tiers without confusing potential clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We use the $100/week as a hook. Getting payment upfront is preferable. The average $100/week person stays 15-18 weeks, worth $1500-$1800. If we get $3000 upfront, we get cash upfront and they're more committed. I have a $3900 annual offer with a one-on-one call. This converts at 30%. To maximize conversions, I'd offer it at $2500-$3000. Offering $2500 annually is over a 50% discount. We use pricing to incentivize and collect cash. The hybrid offer sells the first tier without harming conversion to the client offer. 
> "You're receiving regular workshops and 24/7 access. Beyond that, have an option for my personal help. Members can upgrade or I can build you a custom plan to take an offer from $3k to $3k/week to $3k/day."
 The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits:
