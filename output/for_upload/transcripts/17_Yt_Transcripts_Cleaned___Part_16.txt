# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 16

values that's why we that's why we look at when people get caught doing things that are underhanded who have a a high moral standing in society we have that look yeah because if you undermine certain values then you can never be trusted again it's funny because again it comes back to that idea of we give people credibility where they haven't earned it based on status yeah this is funny in crypto right it's people were surprised that crypto rug pulls happen yeah and it's you trusted this person because they had a hundred thousand followers on Twitter and had been tweeting for six months about this Amazing Project they're going to have or maybe they had a personal brand as a successful Trader they launch something and then all of a sudden they they rug you lose money they make money and you're wait a minute I thought you were supposed to be this person but they'd not necessarily ever shown themselves be a person who was had Integrity in this area it was just that they were successful and we made that synonymous with trustworthy whereas if you've been I was asked yesterday how how many posts have you put on Facebook do you think it's man maybe it averages out at one a day for five years not including stories not including any other platform it's it's a thousand plus and I consistently have people who come into my world and in short term and short times I become clients but the more common theme I see is I've been following you for years so I remember when you finish being a youth pastor or the compounding effect of the audience and the way that people trust you over time is just so invaluable and I think it's an interesting thing to observe because some coaches and Consultants are caught with their pants down going but I thought I could just run a five-day challenge I didn't want to really share my life online and and I think it's it's an interesting place because I'm really enjoying the journey but many people aren't many people are going I just want to run the ads and have the webinar funnel and I didn't sign up to be anyone's Guru and it's well you're a coach it did yeah if you're asking for thousands of dollars from someone they need to know they can trust you you can't just give them to a closer and a really awesome 45-minute sales pitch gets them in they want to know who they're doing business with and there's so many different choices why should they choose you yeah why should they work with you and that's why vlogging and podcasts and and just content in general I think is so powerful when it comes to building audience because it it's easy to pretend for a video and it's really hard to keep the act up over weeks and months and years and dozens and dozens of pieces of content yeah there is there is a barrier even to the way that you've used the word audience there and I'll pick up on this there is a barrier to people getting started with the belief that audience equals mass right right that audience equals a large amount of attention if you take if you go back on my journey my first client I had an audience of one they became a client yeah because of what factor trust right so in the internet world where we're looking at vanity metrics views and likes and things that are on mass we over index on the size of attention we think we need and we under index on trust and that's that's what's happening in the rebalancing now towards the Creator economy and the personal brand and these things because we're trying to rebalance trust that you can grow a really big business an impactful one off a tiny tiny audience if you have the highest levels of trust in the audience so something that stops people is this idea that you need a big audience right because you only need an audience of one person in a relevant way who trusts you to do anything yeah but and the more they trust you the more intimacy that's already been achieved so the more :03 implicitly you understand how you're useful to them on on the journey you go on so I

that you can grow a really big business an impactful one off a tiny tiny audience if you have the highest levels of trust in the audience so something that stops people is this idea that you need a big audience right because you only need an audience of one person in a relevant way who trusts you to do anything yeah but and the more they trust you the more intimacy that's already been achieved so the more :03 implicitly you understand how you're useful to them on on the journey you go on so I think the idea of audience stops :09 a lot of people just as much as it helps people because but we we go to audience and we look at the :16 mass Market yeah yeah everybody is in the media business now to some extent everybody's streaming this and :23 reeling that and tick-tocking this I'll make myself an augment :28 because we've got an audience of something and it always makes me laugh how :34 much traction people can get with tiny little audiences who trust them yeah what's that belief that I don't have an :39 audience or a list and you're do humans :47 and if if they aren't the right person they probably know the right person right it's all concentric circles yeah :53 it's all concentric circles out but we look at it as one big giant one as an audience and that dehumanizes everything :00 in it which just goes back to the point we're talking about before everybody's lost the humanity and marketing right :05 because it used to be person to person and then it went media printed media physical media and then it went :12 digital so we talk about an audience and we forget there's humans inside and it's Madness well we think about a :18 market a niche yeah they're all created equal there's this just a hundred faces all lined up :25 and they all look the same yeah and I just need to sell to five of them because they're my audience they're :30 humans right yeah and the humanity go has gone out of marketing and and persuasion and these things because :37 everybody forgets there's a human on the other side of the action that you're taking and the message you were taking and that that concept has served me so :44 well in writing and creating for things and it's the the interaction that :50 you get on and we've talked about this before the vanity metrics that you get on stuff that moves the needle :57 builds a relationship makes money in in those pieces as often there's an inverse correlation :03 you do the posts with 150 likes on your Facebook feed and it does nothing it :10 doesn't impact anybody because everybody just piles on to say good job yeah but you do the one that got four likes :17 and someone messages you and said oh my God that thing that you said there you really cut through to me and you got a a :24 person at a certain place at a time you touched a human but we've :30 become obsessed with the mass we've become obsessed with needing this audience thing when reality is everybody :36 has one yeah it's not about and I think a better way to even reframe it is you don't need an auditory connection :41 with people and that that group of better if we just got rid of the word yeah guys would have eliminated it now :48 we've got rid of it beep it out but I read the other day and it summarized thoughts I'd had for a long :54 time which is if you want to create a deep connection with the audience go narrow if you want to create a big :59 audience go wide and I think one of the things that's really fascinating to me is how much money I've made that :05 you've made from relatively small audiences we have friends who are I've got clients who are influencers yeah they have a hundred :12 times the amount of followers that I have and make a fraction of the money because they've gone wide and have a big audience

is if you want to create a deep connection with the audience go narrow if you want to create a big :59 audience go wide and I think one of the things that's really fascinating to me is how much money I've made that :05 you've made from relatively small audiences we have friends who are I've got clients who are influencers yeah they have a hundred :12 times the amount of followers that I have and make a fraction of the money because they've gone wide and have a big audience but they don't have a deep :18 connection with the audience they have and that's where I think that's so encouraging to me because for anyone who :24 is looking to get started or restarted or has lost momentum it comes back to the one how can I write to help the :32 one person how can I shoot a video with one person in mind and when I am my :37 YouTube videos now are averaging 400 500 views my first YouTube video :43 that I posted a few months ago got 18 views and I remember picturing 18 people and a coffee shop and I was going :50 that's a lot of people if I was to be talking and they would have been listening and it's funny how numbers again :57 take the humanity away because we often over inflate the importance of big :04 numbers and we underestimate the power of the the small audience that are intently leaning in if you have an :11 audience of 100 people who know and trust you you can make really good money :16 right Kevin Kelly Kevin Kelly thousand true fans yeah it's such a powerful it's a hundred two thousand thousand thousand :23 thousand but his whole thing was if you are passionate about a band or if :28 you're selling T-shirts or if you've got a thousand true fans and so it's just fascinating to me :33 that this isn't this is a conversation I think many people haven't had with themselves which is ultimately :39 why am I doing this because I was sold this dream of I run an ad I have a :45 webinar I have this coaching business and I'm living this laptop lifestyle and they've lost the why :50 and if you lose the service element of you create content for an audience :56 to help people right a byproduct of that help is trust and a byproduct of trust :01 is purchase but if you don't keep the service part piece a part of it all you have is this funnel and metrics :09 and you struggle to gain traction yeah you're running funnels to generate numbers to look at kpis to :14 optimize click-through rates and then you wonder why you're struggling to create a sense of connection yeah and it's that game of guess who you're :20 does your person have glasses you're knocking them down it's niches work the same way it's well I'm looking for chiropractors on the :25 Internet it's well let's just get personal what types of chiropractors who are they do anyone what do they important yeah what :32 do they want what do they need what's the thing that keeps them up at night all of that stuff yeah one of the things I wanted to talk about was :38 authenticity yeah I think that's probably the thing I've observed in both of us is the the more comfortable with :45 being in our own skin the better businesses we've created because we are not creating from a place :50 of insecurity and scarcity I want to be someone on the internet I want to look a certain way and it's been a sense of :56 I know for me the physical the physical sensation I think of is just :02 just a sense of comfort yeah in my skin what is that Journey been for you over the last couple of years :09 and was that very difficult was there a moment where you're throwing in the towel on the mimicry and you're :14 going I'm not going all in on James what has that been no the only the only

internet I want to look a certain way and it's been a sense of :56 I know for me the physical the physical sensation I think of is just :02 just a sense of comfort yeah in my skin what is that Journey been for you over the last couple of years :09 and was that very difficult was there a moment where you're throwing in the towel on the mimicry and you're :14 going I'm not going all in on James what has that been no the only the only lightning strike :20 moment was when I realized I needed to go online when I was standing in the rain waiting for another Fairy that's the only that only was :28 screw it I've got to do something but everything else has been very Progressive I think two major events were moving to Bali because this place :36 what does it do to you I think it it puts you out in an environment that you're not used to and and is very much :44 it's not it's it's not eat what you kill but it's very much you you realize you're outside of an of the :49 normal systems that you normally depend on and then separating from my wife last year which was :55 oh I have to find myself :00 after being with someone for 25 years which is who am I because you think :06 yourself but when you're in an intimate relationship you both have shared beliefs but you also :12 have beliefs that you need to believe for each other you compromise and and then there's trade-offs so that those :18 two things have have been the biggest catalysts along that journey of finding :23 who I really am because again for in the last nine months it's been around doing :29 the things I had to do and and we you talk about authenticity as well it's the last nine months have been the :35 most brutal emotionally but also financially that I've had to endure for :40 almost a decade for obvious reasons :46 but I've never felt more certain :51 of who I am and enabling me to operate in that because :58 I had to I have to people depend on me so I think :05 when you get when the when it gets real you have to be authentic to yourself :13 otherwise you don't this is the choice that you've made right when it gets real you don't have to :19 be authentic to yourself there's so many different parts you could have taken this year so why yeah we've talked this one :25 what was it about this year that you were big so sorry to interrupt no :31 guys so business is moving in a great direction for you now yeah but you could have just as easily gone I'm just :37 gonna focus on being a dad and not that you're not doing that yeah but you're also taking leaps and strides and :42 your health and things that it's definitely something that you using to make yourself better but not everyone :49 makes that choice no and that's a brutally hard choice because it's much easier to :57 what has caused you to approach it the way that you have this year I don't feel I have any choice and :04 that's what keeps me going and even hearing people say what a good job I'm doing and all those things and I get lots of Praise from lots of people makes :09 me uncomfortable so I'm still working on the being being grateful for who I am and :15 what I do and that and that receiving book because I feel uncomfortable now just from you going :20 you could have done this another way and it could be much worse and it could be objectively :26 so your faint praise is is always welcome but discomforting :31 I I reconfirm stuff that I guess I knew I love being a dad :37 but I didn't know that I knew that right because my ex-wife and I had :44 different ideas of children and what what they'd what what impact they'd had on our lives and those things :50

uncomfortable now just from you going :20 you could have done this another way and it could be much worse and it could be objectively :26 so your faint praise is is always welcome but discomforting :31 I I reconfirm stuff that I guess I knew I love being a dad :37 but I didn't know that I knew that right because my ex-wife and I had :44 different ideas of children and what what they'd what what impact they'd had on our lives and those things :50 and I'm no I love being a dad might love having a loving :55 relationship so it was it was those things of those moments of clarity I also think :00 it's easier I'm 43 I think it's easier as :06 you get older because you just you've done more stuff and you get more of a sense of you've done and tried more :11 stuff so you get more of a sense of the the decisions you make but if because if you listen to yourself you you've got :16 enough instinct to know which which which where's your North Star and where to go so it's been brutally :24 difficult in the practice of doing the things I've done in the last year :30 but it hasn't been difficult getting myself to do them if that makes sense it does make sense and I think about :37 how different this would look and feel if you were an accountant going through a really hard season yeah because you :42 rock up to work you've got your spreadsheets you've got your co-workers you can head down and you can just :48 almost hide we have a very public life yeah but :54 I did do that and I can afford to do that right I can afford to not work yeah :00 for a period of time right yeah so :05 why do I go back to working and why do I make the decisions I do because I gotta :11 I can't not do it so how did you navigate that that was what I'm trying to get to because :16 there is there is a lot of professions that don't have us out publicly having this conversation it doesn't have us :21 posting content and coaching clients and being asked the hard questions so how did you navigate that almost feeling :27 the plane is Airborne and you're changing both engines at the same time and so James is rocking up to a coaching :33 call and as opposed to previous seasons of Life probably doesn't feel he's got it all together doesn't feel he :39 knows which way is up how did you navigate that and work through that while you're still working on all :45 those things going on in your life I pretended I acted when I needed to that I had my :50

[ __ ] together but in in certain moments you definitely don't feel it I had moments there where I was :03 I remember doing a call with a mutual friend of ours for an hour for an hour and a half in :08 January that I had to do and he could tell that I was not not :14 in a good spot but most other people couldn't but which is the skill of :22 playing a character on the internet so I think I navigated it through a mixture of gretton determination some acting and :29 then giving myself a lot of Grace and and also the sheer fact that I I didn't have to do a lot I had to unwind :36 and unravel a lot of stuff in a business that was starting to show signs of being a business that I thought I :43 wanted I was very leveraged and scaled and it wasn't necessarily dependent on the personal brand and some :48 of the things that I'm back to doing now but I think everything was a choice :53 and there were definitely times where I felt I could curl up and sit in the hole :59 still are but there's there's a bigger picture of play I think the kids :04 and a relationship I'm in now that is got a defined future in terms of :10 something that we're doing and going towards have been the most simple factor of that and then friends :17 you and our friend Chris in terms of keeping me sane in terms of :22 in in you've reminded me many times that everything's a choice you get to choose :28 every day those words sit with me a lot I remember when you said them to me you get to choose every day and :34 I'm I'm lucky that I've built a lot of ways to make choices I guess if you :40 said if I wasn't if I was had a job and I was an accountant and I had to go nine to five :45 in those things I don't know how those people get through it and a lot of mainly men don't :50 yeah get through it at this time of life because it feels catastrophic the end of a long relationship with kids and :56 intertwined and all those things so it's not been easy and it still isn't :03 but I think it it gives you the it gives you the reality check :09 of the lived reality that you're in because I think these days we can live a fantasy land for a long :15 time until the rugs pulled from under us and did you feel that's where you were was it was were you living :22 authentically a year ago two years ago was there any sense of autopilot that you that looking back you're :29 no I wasn't create because I I think about this in terms of business models as well yeah there :34 was certain periods of time where for me and my my business I was just following :40 Alex romozy I was freaking it was Braveheart he was on the horse we were charging four and we were :46 we were warring against scale or whatever and and so I was just blindly just doing stuff and it wasn't :53 until they have these Rock Bottom moments or these I would never forget going to La December 2021 and the :59 best way I could describe it is my body hit low battery mode it was what why and it was through those :05 periods where I it woke me up a bit and so was there any sense that there's things were on autopilot or :11 there was the playing of a character anything that always I want to come back to what you just said because I I was on the inside of that as :18 well so I want to give perspective on your side if I can go for it but :23 the in hindsight yes there was there was just that curse of :29 Competency that allowed everything to just to keep rolling on despite a feeling of disease that :36 permeated large Bits Of My Life that this is this
