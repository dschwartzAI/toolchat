# New Transcripts James - Part 12

. I have 80% conversion rates. And without skipping a beat, hormo goes, oh my gosh, that's horrible. And the guy's really taking aback and he is, oh man, you charge way too little. And it was such a powerful moment seeing the penny drop for my client in such an abrupt way of, oh wow. Yeah. What am I doing? This is crazy. And I think that's a real, pricing. I, I have really strong thoughts on pricing 'cause I don't think you should charge a ton of money and make sales really hard and retention really hard. You're looking for a sweet spot. But on the flip side, it's when I had modern autonomy last year, I was charging, I want everyone to hear this. Listen. 'cause it's very, very powerful. I was charging 297 a month for this is, this is real for six support calls a week and unlimited one-to-one with a coach, 297 a month, cancel any time, right? We, we got people in, but it was a nightmare, not the right people. Then in August we stripped back from six calls a week to one call a week. And I, and we removed all one-to-one and we de we increased the price from 297 a month, cancel anytime to $150 a week with a 16 week commitment. No, it was a six month commitment. We sold more people in and we attracted way higher quality people with 80% less delivery. Then we went to 200 a week and it continued to sell and we got 30 clients at that price point in August. Completely automated. That was a huge, huge lesson for me. Sometimes this problem we have of not working with the, the right clients, clients with really, really high standards, low work ethic, not the great vibe. It's a reflection of price because you get what you settle for. Yeah. And at different price points and different goals, the friction levels will be opposite. Right? My $9 trial has a very different goal in terms of friction and filtering than working one with me one-to-one, right? Yep. And so the friction management at, if you've got multiple price points and multiple products or multiple at, at, at, it's related to how much proximity the person has, how much access, what commitments you're making. Yeah. So the, the, pricing is a filter. Yeah. Well, do this guy, this guy Dan Gogh on X? Yeah. So I think Vince is still on the call., he was telling me that he met Dan Gogh. Dan Gogh's a fitness coach, a health and fitness coach. And so he, he probably has an offer, I could probably guess the price point somewhere in the three to $6,000 range. And, but Vince was telling me he has a hundred thousand dollars offer And then he sold it. He sold a few of them. And there's, there's a really interesting framework pricing that I think sometimes it's really, really helpful to have a super expensive thing that number one might take more of the level of support than you, than you want to scale at capacity. And number two, value anchors everything else. someone reached out the other day, who's one of the top network marketers in the world who's become a really good friend of mine. And she was, can you help me build the IG funnel?, help me build it out, do some of it for me. And normally I would just be, this is, I would never do that, but she's really cool. And I was, maybe this would be interesting. So I was, okay, it's 36 K, right? Because I had to find a price that I was, I'd be willing to do it for this amount

. And she was, can you help me build the IG funnel?, help me build it out, do some of it for me. And normally I would just be, this is, I would never do that, but she's really cool. And I was, maybe this would be interesting. So I was, okay, it's 36 K, right? Because I had to find a price that I was, I'd be willing to do it for this amount. And also I have no attachment to whether or not they're gonna say yes. And I think us having offers that you are not attached to selling, but that if it's sold, you'd be over the moon, I think can be really powerful. I don't think change your whole funnel and create an offer that you're depending on and then make it really, really high priced. But for some of you you, you are missing out on a $10,000 VIP day because it doesn't exist. You are, you are missing out on a, I'll fly to you and we workshop together for two, two days, $20,000 thing. And having these tiers and these offers around in your world that you're not diverting all energy towards, but simply having them and putting them out into the market is very, very, very powerful. And at a pure strategic level price anchoring people Yeah. At higher prices helps everything else. Oh yeah. And sometimes you don't even know what demand is in your market until you, you ask if offer to satisfy it in 2021, but Offers solve everything A hundred percent. You have, you have almost zero downside offering something. In 2021, I sold six 20 5K one-to-one coaching spots for 12 weeks. And I'd never done anything that before. And I didn't even know there was anyone who was gonna buy. And it was, and I did it back then out of the energy of I need to make money because I was about to move to America and I felt poor. And also taxes were expensive. And so I was, I need to make some money. So I was, I'm gonna offer one-to-one coaching. And I was, I'm gonna offer one-to-one coaching and I sold six spots at 20 5K each. And then some of those people stayed for a very long time at $10,000 a month. And I was, whoa, I would've never known that that existed. Had I not put that out, I would've never known that demand existed. And so for some of you, you just need to be playing around, not just in the bottom end of workshops and getting people in. Just, just be unapologetic with occasionally just putting out really expensive stuff and seeing if anyone's gonna buy it. The worst case is no one buys and you're in the exact same place that you're in right now. And the best case is obviously it could change your model and change your bank account. Yeah. People, when people were coming to coming to Bali, they were asking me, how do I bring my family? Where do they stay? Et cetera, et cetera. And I was, oh, should get a villa so people can stay in it. And I just, yeah, By the way, if you wanna buy mine, you could buy mine if you wanna do the trifecta. 'cause we're selling our house. So if you wanna build the trifecta of your own little compound and maybe start a cult or a gang, I think that'll be Who thinks James, James should of buy my house? Of if you think James should buy my house, just drop a drop a yes in the chat. ? I'm kidding. But we do need to put it on the Market. King, king of the gang. If I own, yeah

. 'cause we're selling our house. So if you wanna build the trifecta of your own little compound and maybe start a cult or a gang, I think that'll be Who thinks James, James should of buy my house? Of if you think James should buy my house, just drop a drop a yes in the chat. ? I'm kidding. But we do need to put it on the Market. King, king of the gang. If I own, yeah. If I own more than 20% of it, I'm the official king. A hundred percent., is there any other questions here?, we had Jim's question, someone asked about soft CTA and YouTube videos., it was, that was directed at you? At me. Yeah., I'll just say there's no right answer. What's The, what's the soft one compared to a hard one?, I imagine it's just, Hey, by the way, my s**t Versus check this out. Yeah, I'd say so. Yeah. I, I think, I think talking about things is, is is their own as their own CTA, right. I I think people say call to action is VSL, it's a little bit too literal, I think. Yeah. The a call to action doesn't is not a sales pitch. It's a suggestion. Yeah, it's an invitation. Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's a, that's another more probably even more useful way to look at it. Check this out. If you want more of this, click on this. If you want more of this message me. If you want, more info, hit reply., there, and I've found that, it's not about, it's not about video, but it's about email. I found you can have multiple CTAs in one piece of content. Yeah. I quite regularly now will have a link to buy something and a PS or a, a thing on the bottom, which encourages people to reply for two completely different things. Yeah. Right. Because all they are is that all they are is an invitation. And some people will take up that invitation or clicking on something and buy it and other people will take up the invitation of of, of doing it. I think, the question is what is the natural, you've been saying, Dan, signpost, what is the natural next thing to ask them to do? Or or, or make 'em invite? if you need to have a conversation with someone about, before you sell them something or you, you need to have a conversation to, to make sure it's suitable for them. Yeah. Just say, reach out. Just have a chat. The, the, the, the energy behind what you say is infinitely more important than what you say., we've all been on the receiving end of an invitation. That was not an invitation. It was some form of manipulation., the mother-in-law or the mother or the father or the brother. And they're not making, an invitation. They're suggesting something very, very strongly., I get this when I'm in New Zealand. It's, not casual, Hey, if you're free this week, let me know otherwise No worries. It's, Hey, I'm free these days. When can I come around? Only if you're free though. No pressure. But I would really love to see the grandkids. I may or may not be speaking about a grandparent right now. And the the energy behind those is that you already know that there's, there's, there's a wrong answer here, right? And the easiest way I've found to move people through a funnel to help them improve their lives by buying our products is to not care whether or not they go through the funnel and buy your products

. No pressure. But I would really love to see the grandkids. I may or may not be speaking about a grandparent right now. And the the energy behind those is that you already know that there's, there's, there's a wrong answer here, right? And the easiest way I've found to move people through a funnel to help them improve their lives by buying our products is to not care whether or not they go through the funnel and buy your products. And I know that's so intangible and counterintuitive, but I'm telling you, I have done, I don't know how many YouTube videos, YouTube has made me so much money. I have now three videos on there that have a call to action and they're just the VSLs the different versions. And then maybe in 5% of videos, I remind, I remember to remind people that there is a video in the link. The number one piece of of feedback I get from my video content is that. I'm not trying to sell people anything, which is ironic 'cause I, I do have something to sell. I just never think about that thing I have to sell when I'm creating content. I do not muddy the waters. And so whether you make an invitation or not, both can totally work. I find that, that I attract better clients when I assume that they're all smart. And so if they want to find out more about me, they'll click the link in the description or, the reason landing pages exist is because we are scared that if we send someone on a website, they're gonna get lost too many buttons. Oh my gosh, what are they gonna, and I just, I I've just found to be true for myself, the more I assume that the people that follow me are really smart and know what to do, the more I attract really smart people., I'll give you an example. P pragmatically on, on the ad strategy. The primary ad strategy I have is to grow my Instagram to get people to follow me. I used to say in the first sentence, follow Dan Bolton or follow at Bolton if you are X and want y. Now I just boost content. And the CTA on the ad is a part of Meta meta's ad structure, which just says visit Instagram profile. So I assume my people are smart enough to read a piece of content that resonates with and go, Hmm, who's this guy? I don't think I have to tell them to follow me. They just naturally do. When I removed the follow me CTAI got more followers at a cheaper price. It's the, it's the same thing if when people ask me how long does the copy need to be right? I said, as long as it, as long as it needs to be to, to tell the story you want to tell or convey the message you want to convey. Right? The right quote unquote, people will read it and the wrong quote unquote people won't. And so it's the, I firmly believe we're in the ideas business and if you have high conviction and insight and passionate about the ideas, then that's what comes through. And that's the CTA, that's the only CTA you need. Elizabeth, who is now, I I this question formally Liz, who's now formally Liz. Yeah. What would you do? I feel my answer would be crap. I wouldn't try and build a community. I would try and assemble a hundred people around a single thing that I'd solve for myself and show them how to do it. I'd get a hundred guys to show them how to navigate divorce. I'd get a hundred guys to show them how to boost their testosterone or something that to a thousand, What's up, what's up with the new, what's up with the new direction, bro, I've got it

. I wouldn't try and build a community. I would try and assemble a hundred people around a single thing that I'd solve for myself and show them how to do it. I'd get a hundred guys to show them how to navigate divorce. I'd get a hundred guys to show them how to boost their testosterone or something that to a thousand, What's up, what's up with the new, what's up with the new direction, bro, I've got it. I've got it oozing out my portal. But No, I, I, I wouldn't try, I'd just be really, really useful and really specific to a hundred people., I'm come here and I'm gonna show you how to do this because I would have high confidence that once I'd showed them how to solve that problem or fulfill that desire that that I would've created another one for them to stick around and enough trust to, to for to, for them to ask me to help them do it. Okay. I'm, oh, I'm just using silly example, but, I'll help you navigate divorce and then I help you find a Brazilian Wife as if you help them facilitate new divorce. And Then I help you have far too many children and then I help you get too many do, I, I just think Problems and solutions stack onto each other and if we're really useful to somebody, we're solving a problem and creating another one in real time. And I wouldn't think about the long term. I'd think about being super useful to a hundred people and I get 'em into it into one place and I'd show them just how to do that and then let everything unfold. And, the a hundred people would probably dwindle off into, into 50, but by that time you, you would've had, you would've brought more people in on the, on the front end who wanted to solve that particular problem or fulfill that desire. I think we're, I think we're really qualified to do a very small number of things. Yeah. And we are, we, we dabble in the others and so if we think about what we're really, really qualified to do, we are extremely useful to a hundred people on earth right now. Yeah. How I would think about it is, I remove time. I don't, I no longer think about fastest or slowest because I just dunno if time exists on a metaphysical quantum perspective. And, anytime I insist on anything being fast, even fastest, I lose sight of it. So how I would think about it is from a, if you're asking a pragmatic question, not the spiritual side, but the pragmatic, but that aligns with me is I would create one offer that gives people a level of support, that most coaching programs don't. So I wouldn't make them go through, Sarah and John, the support coaches to maybe get me on a support call. It's, we are, we are in this together. Me and this a hundred people are in this together. The second thing is I would focus on one channel, right? So I would really, the more, the more I, the more I think about it strategically, the more I'm, maybe email is the best way. It's just that it just, I just don't it. 'cause it's just one channel., it's, it's just broadcast. you could, you could send, I could see myself sending five emails a day in the future, just treating it Facebook. But I would, but I would do that with YouTube. So whether it's Instagram and YouTube or email on YouTube, I probably wouldn't do all three again anymore., and I would just, yeah, I, I'm just answering as if I would do it right now

. 'cause it's just one channel., it's, it's just broadcast. you could, you could send, I could see myself sending five emails a day in the future, just treating it Facebook. But I would, but I would do that with YouTube. So whether it's Instagram and YouTube or email on YouTube, I probably wouldn't do all three again anymore., and I would just, yeah, I, I'm just answering as if I would do it right now. I'd create a VSL The key thing though is I would really just say no to anything that that is going to pull me away from doing what feels most alive to me. The, the, the short way is always the long way because the short way never eventuates. And so then you end up starting another short way and another short way and then another fastest path. And I think the, the way that I would do it is not too dissimilar to what I do strategically when I did it. I think it's much more about allowing myself to say no to anything that sounds work. I think that I make the most money when I do nothing. I, we've talked about this before, James. I almost entirely get paid to exist. My definition of getting paid to exist is all of us. If we had no obligations in the world, maybe for the next month you would do nothing. You'd play semi retired, you'd have fun. You, you have no money needs. That's great. At some point though, you'll, you're gonna start to get the jitters of, I want to do something with my life. Whatever you would do with no constraints is, is your version of existence. For me. There's no world where I have so much money, I don't create something that's the stuff I want to do. It's why I am on earth. And so for me, it's just eliminating anything that feels work and everyth and leaning into everything that just feels I get to exist and do this. in no way do I feel any level of work being on this call., I'm, dude, look at where I'm sitting right now., this is so sick. I have a coffee. I got my electrolytes, I've got some Turkish on the way. This is unbelievable. And it's more than just the beach or the computer or the lifestyle. It's that I just get to show up and be me. And I think that's the best gift we could give ourselves in any way, shape or form is where are we trying to conform to a version of ourselves that isn't who we really are. And so the question for me is, what would I do if it was guaranteed to work? if I knew that a hundred clients was inevitable, what's the stuff that I would just love to do? And I think those kinds of questions are really powerful because it strips away all the obligation and it allows you to tap into your true essence. But, the origin point of all my objectively and subjectively best offers was one person. Yeah., I'm, I'm conceptualizing how I'm conceptual., it's not how I, I know how, but I'm conceptualizing when I launch a done for you offer shortly because I'm, I saw someone get stuck in a place that they, I can not get them stuck in by execution around a, a funnel. And I'm, if I just did this for this person, it would, everything else would flow from it and this, that, that, that this would be an exponential intervention for this person. And that's the same characteristic of every offer that is, it was for, it was for something I saw with one person and then it, the scale comes from the trust that well, if it's really useful and really good for one person, then it's probably good for 10. Yeah
