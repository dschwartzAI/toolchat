# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 17

autopilot or :11 there was the playing of a character anything that always I want to come back to what you just said because I I was on the inside of that as :18 well so I want to give perspective on your side if I can go for it but :23 the in hindsight yes there was there was just that curse of :29 Competency that allowed everything to just to keep rolling on despite a feeling of disease that :36 permeated large Bits Of My Life that this is this it was the a :44 feeling for a decent part of the last of the last year last a couple of a year or two ago :51 and in that period so there was definitely things that I ignored but I :57 could put them away because I do have a high pain threshold I have a :03 tolerant I have the tolerance of lots of entrepreneurs have because we can tolerate things that other people can't :08 and we just normalize it and I saw you go through that I saw you knowing that you needed to :14 stop and slow down and and focus on yourself and you were saying to me at the time :19 that you knew you did it but you didn't feel able to because :25 we were both playing characters of we need to do this because there's some :32 higher power mummy and daddy coaching issue or Mentor Mentor issues to say :38 what would they think of us if we pulled the plug on this 13-person business what would they think of us if we pulled the :44 plug on this 25-year relationship and 15-year marriage so :49 all the evidence is there for us and we we often know :55 it's the difference between knowing and knowledge right yeah we know our bodies are telling us yeah the :01 level that I've talked about with you about my sleep issues and those things for :06 most of last year I sleep a baby now most of the :12 last year I didn't yeah there's this karmic Force waking you up at three o'clock in the :18 morning telling you that something's off yeah and I just ignored all the signs yeah and I think you you recognize bits :24 of that that there was stuff there that was this is the signal this is a signal this is it's not noise yeah just :31 to to to say that something needs to change it's identifying the changes is the biggest challenge :37 and we can't do that ourselves we sometimes fear is very difficult anyway :42 it sometimes fear looks wisdom right so when you have a team :47 and it might not even be oh what will people think it's these people have jobs and if I don't have this :54 business they don't have a job I'm morally obligated to do that right yeah and so for me there was also that layer :00 of I was so concerned about everyone else's health and safety it's :05 that metaphor of who's whose mask do you put on first for me I felt so indebted :11 to these people on my team that I felt indebted to the clients that entrusted their hard-earned money into :17 this business model that I'd created that I was if I step out of this model I might be serving myself but I'm :24 doing a disservice to everyone else and even as it turns out that's not what happened people found better jobs :31 clients love the transition right but the reality is of you you live with that weight and it's it it's I don't :38 want to oversimplify it but so much of human nature and so much of the decisions we find ourselves making really comes down to are we being :45 influenced by external forces or are we being our intentions moving us internally to do things and :52 make things happen and so the authenticity Journey for me has been really interesting because I stripped it :58 back to to nothing and I was playing around with those ideas of okay so you have all the money in the :04 world what do you want

:38 want to oversimplify it but so much of human nature and so much of the decisions we find ourselves making really comes down to are we being :45 influenced by external forces or are we being our intentions moving us internally to do things and :52 make things happen and so the authenticity Journey for me has been really interesting because I stripped it :58 back to to nothing and I was playing around with those ideas of okay so you have all the money in the :04 world what do you want to wake up and do and as I was giving myself permission with without putting the :09 expectations of I but I run a team of all these people and but I'm working with Alex and what will he :14 think it became so freeing because I was man I think I'm really :19 clear on on who I am and who I want to be and I'm not running a business that reflects that but it took me deciding :26 that my health was most important that my passion was most important that I I couldn't just keep upping my my pain :33 threshold and keep enduring more to for everyone else's sake I had to really look after myself not just from a :40 physical mental emotional health objective but but for the longevity of my life I'm gonna die at some point :47 I have no idea when my life is going to end I hope when it does I can look back on the seasons that I've been living at :54 going I've been living true to who I am yeah I've been playing this mimicry of trying to be :00 this coach or this coach but I was living the best way I damn could to be Dan Bolton to be the truest version of :06 who I am and that became It came it came because I hit the pain threshold of :13 I can't be this other person that other people that I feel other people need me to be it sounds this year's :19 been formative for you in that way as well yeah yeah again you you just can't again the consequence piece of :26 if I am and continue to be that or if I continue to pretend then the the :31 cost is coming into view which is probably what you felt as well if I keep doing this :37 bad things are going to happen and I think authenticity I again it's one of those words that :45 has been bastardized a bit because authenticity means to lots of people just share stuff on the :52 internet to manipulate people yeah whereas true Earth intensity is living :59 your own life but also understanding that evolves yeah the Dan Bolton of today :06 is not even the Dan Bolton even tomorrow yeah right but they're still the same they're still the same entity :12 yeah and going forward that this person is authentic if you're evolving authentically based on the a :18 small number of things that are important to you then it's still you yeah but this is what I find interesting :23 about evolution is that we I :29 remember having a conversation with Liv a few years ago and I was I just want to become a :35 new Dan Bolton I want to become Dan Bolton 2

.0 and then I sat there I thought about it and I was :41 am I becoming new Dan Bolton or am I becoming true Dan Moulton now funny play on words but for me what's really :47 interesting is if I think about who I was as an 18 year old I'm more reflective of the 18 year old now :54 and this season than I have been for the last five years because I deviated so far from the values of the vision that I :00 had for my life now this is of course not true at every age I can't look back at Dan Moulton at seven dead :06 multiple seven wanted to be a backup dancer in the Spice Girls 100 True got my mum to call the travel agents to :14 figure out how much it would cost to fly to the UK you took action you're an action taker The Action preseason :21 already believe in my ability to figure it out but when we look at overall I'm gonna make that dream come true for you one day I promise please bring back the :29 reunion when we look over the our lives there is so much breadcrumbs as :34 to who the true version of us is yeah definitely so Evolution we think about it in terms of the self-creation but :40 it's almost the self-discovery of the person that was always there I think Michelangelo carved David is that is that who :47 did it was it Leonardo da Vinci one of the one of the greats right he carved David out of the Rock and he said David was always there I just had to chip away :54 everything that was not him and and I think the process of evolution is almost that that it's not as if you :59 and I are blank slates right now and we go who do we want to be there's a level of freedom to that but it's almost who have we always been that we've :07 been ignoring this whole time the idea for me building my business around creation now dude I grew up :14 playing music all I wanted to do was play music as an adult that was the only thing I dreamed of doing was music drama :20 Then I then I spent almost a decade of my life where the main part of what I did was speaking and creating messages :26 yeah and then I started an ads agency and I was just an ad accounts all day and then I built a team and I was just :32 in meetings all day there was no point where I was this is the version of Dan that I feel I'm supposed to be I just lost sight of that and it's it's :40 so tough that it takes really low moments for us to get there but whatever :45 it takes for us to get there it's almost less about imagining and it's more about remembering :52 it's more about remembering the person we've always been and coming back to that the the interesting one story :58 I told recently was the pervasive childhood memory for me was Lego :03 so I would get Lego and I would assemble it and I'd immediately disassemble it and then make it into lots of different :10 things that were my own creations and it's interesting I'd done the same thing in business right I'd immediately :16 learned something and then disassemble it and make it slightly mine to get a result from it and I still do that to :22 this day that that innate okay there's a pattern here there's a system to follow :28 but in the process of building that system I think I've seen a better way to do it I'm going to do it on my own and :35 again I ignored that or so many times where I overplayed that as as a :41 one-trick pony of being I'm just going to be a derivative of that and it is largely remembering that find something :48 stand on the shoulders of giants but then in a from a creative sense down on the shoulder of :54 Giants and then choose choose

[ __ ] so why do we have a complicator why is it that people go :27 through all of the seasons of being someone they're not and all that stuff is it that we just don't know is :32 it that we feel we haven't given ourselves permission for it we don't have the skills because I feel I'm in the same season I only want to do :39 stuff I'm excited to do and it's super profitable super fun and I'm why :44 did I not do this not only that the crazy thing is people admire and respect :50 it much more than any other action because they're it is so obvious that someone is living their own lives :57 yeah and that is freedom yeah right so we talk about Freedom as the the highest pursuit of humans and these :03 things which I believe and when they see someone doing what they really genuinely :09 want and loving it people are I want to follow this model right :15 and you can be so uncompromising on that yeah I am so uncompromising now I :21 am so strong boundaries around things that I do yeah and but in the container :29 is coaching word in the container of what I make it's going to be the best thing it possibly is for what it you :35 know what it says on the turn and people people admire and respect that yeah because they're that's Freedom he's :40 doing what he wants yo I think Joseph Campbell says we're not so much searching for meaning in life as we are :46 for the experience of being Fully Alive and then people wonder why as a stressed :51 out coach they're struggling to get clients but it's if I'm signing up to a coach who looks they're :57 miserable and stressed and that they hate the business that they're in yeah in what world am I going to be feeling :04 more Fully Alive working with them than another coach who feels you're looking at their business and :10 you're going are they having this thing called fun that's crazy and that's been interesting for me as I've been creating :16 content more in this year as I've been burned everything to the ground simplified things people will say things :21 I really your videos don't really know why I feel such a connection with you I really your energy or :28 something to that effect and for me this marketing psychology and all sorts :33 of stuff and no doubt I have skills that are undergirding that I've built over the last few years the biggest thing is :39 I'm only creating videos I want to create yeah I refuse to create anything I'm not excited about so I we have done :47 no YouTube research when with launching the YouTube channel around best Trends I'm I want to talk :52 about things I want to talk about and I want to talk about them in a way that I'm excited to talk about them I don't want to just create content for the sake :58 of it I don't want to create a funnel for the sake of it I don't want to create anything for the sake of it but most people that's where they live from :04 they live from that energy of need and I have to rather than the energy of I get to yeah yeah and that's where I think :10 there's the big shift that that a lot of people could make I think it could and I think there's a whole industry that's going to prevent them right which is the :17 one we're in right because I think I think a huge amount of people buy coaching or what is cool coaching now in :23 terms of the group coaching environment because of trauma bonding right they're looking for an authority figure in their life because they were unfulfilled from :30 the authority figures that were presented to them in early life and you've alluded to this :35 and there's a huge fear of Annoying mummy or Daddy because you don't follow the system right and that

one we're in right because I think I think a huge amount of people buy coaching or what is cool coaching now in :23 terms of the group coaching environment because of trauma bonding right they're looking for an authority figure in their life because they were unfulfilled from :30 the authority figures that were presented to them in early life and you've alluded to this :35 and there's a huge fear of Annoying mummy or Daddy because you don't follow the system right and that :41 and that as then injected learned helplessness into the actions of people who are scared to :47 move on their own and scared to do what they really want in case there aren't casts from the group so we've got we've :53 got mummy and daddy issues trauma bonding and tribe Dynamics or convalescing :58 around keeping people stuck yeah but just enough people can mimic the business model of the person they're :04 learning from or the the skills or whatever it is to be successful for that to for the that scheme to continue yeah :12 but the the failure the failure rates of the promise result in this industry are :17 disgusting they're single-figure percentages because the promises got so big and so ridiculous and the guarantees :23 got so out of this world thanks Mr homozy the purple book over there yeah yeah or you don't :28 pay but it's acceptable to have single figure success things :34 yeah but the interesting thing about what both you and I have done is not measured success just on money right :40 we're we're talking to people and saying what lights you're out do you want a fun business do you want to do it with these :46 yeah because you can have profit as well yeah but it's a byproduct of these things and we talk about profit we talk :52 about money we talk about all these things because they're important to get freedom and they're Downstream from these things and they enable resources :57 enable us to do things but I think the interesting thing that the interesting Journey both you and I are on right now :04 is that we're not doing it when we're not making money that's compromising the fun and the ease and the values and :09 those things yeah and that's what people resonate with they're because money is :15 people hate that money is easy yeah right the other stuff is difficult oh yeah but if it it's got to be the :23 right money it's got to be the right school board and that's what people are looking for and that's that's the :28 healthy byproduct of a sophistication of a Marketplace as well because people someone said to me in a message this :35 morning I'm not looking for another Guru right now and I was tongue-in-cheek :40 back saying thank you for tangentially calling me a guru what are you and then just start asking questions :46 what do they want in those things yeah and and none of the questions how much money do you want to make yeah it's what are you doing right now :53 what are you enjoying what are you hating what do you want us to look yeah and what's meaningful to :58 you in terms of profitability and those things from where you are yeah in many cases the hard thing that people only go of is :05 that to change business models and change some of the things that they need to change because they're keeping them trapped yeah there is a period where you :11 go backwards before you go forwards I've had to go backwards before I went forwards and and recent :16 history yeah but I needed to do it for lots of reasons but I also had :22 accepted that that was going to be the case that I could I could take the L's for a few months to get back on :28 to to do and be inside something that I loved I think this :34 brings me to the word of the theme that I had for this year which is :39 this whole idea of

go forwards I've had to go backwards before I went forwards and and recent :16 history yeah but I needed to do it for lots of reasons but I also had :22 accepted that that was going to be the case that I could I could take the L's for a few months to get back on :28 to to do and be inside something that I loved I think this :34 brings me to the word of the theme that I had for this year which is :39 this whole idea of conscious yeah and I hate that in the way that it gets hijacked by the spiritual entrepreneurs :44 of we work with conscious coaches and I understand we're repurposing all these words :51 idea of I want to build a life based off intention I want to be awake at the wheel not :59 asleep at the wheel not on autopilot and I think my hope is for anyone :04 listen to this conversation that they realize that without knowing all the details it :11 starts with the decision am I going to try and I was listening to someone the other day that was saying the opposite of being :17 yourself is fitting in because fitting in requires you to be someone that you think the tribe needs :23 you to be to fit in well yeah it's taking the shape of something to to make it fit exactly :30 right and so most of us have spent our lives being professional fitting inner :37 is right we have we we've managed the perception of other people we want to go to the event we don't want to be the odd :43 one out we don't want to be at the the metaphorical lunch table by ourselves we :48 want to be in a tribe and what that often means is we have to sacrifice who :54 we are to be what we think the tribe needs us and wants us to be and for me I :59 know it sounds it's for you it comes down to this decision you make which is that Am I Living For others am I going to live for myself and it :06 doesn't mean am I living a life of selfishness or selflessness the most selfless thing you could do is live a :11 life that's fully expressing yourself yeah in service of others yeah but it's :16 not even good strategy because being a freaky weirdo gets you the most attention fitting fitting in is the :23 least profitable thing that anyone can do get everybody's doing it but because it's not for the reasons of strategies :28 for the reasons of self-worth it's for the reasons of self-esteem yeah so it doesn't even make any sense on the :35 in the game that people are trying to play yeah or fitting it because standing out :41 is the most profitable thing you can ever do in today's society and isn't it ironic it's in Pursuit that's :49 what I found with with the season I'm in is the less I focus on money and the more I focus on doing stuff I want to do the more money I make Yeah Yeah the more :56 fun I have the more it makes to the point where we talked about this yesterday I was it should feel it's cheating yeah yeah right if :02 success but it should feel it's cheating yeah and sometimes I look around and go this must be cheating yeah I've had a :09 couple of days this week whereas this has got to be cheating yeah I did that I did that much and I got :16 this much back yeah across multiple domains financial and meaning and all those things this :22 feels cheating well this this just comes back to this idea of self-awareness who am I what am I :28 passionate about what are my skill sets what Life do I want to lead and then what business will help me achieve :34 those things and I think if people ask those questions we have you come up with some really hard :40 answers sometimes which is yeah I'm making I have a business that is exists to pay the bills or fuel the ego
