# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 18

and meaning and all those things this :22 feels cheating well this this just comes back to this idea of self-awareness who am I what am I :28 passionate about what are my skill sets what Life do I want to lead and then what business will help me achieve :34 those things and I think if people ask those questions we have you come up with some really hard :40 answers sometimes which is yeah I'm making I have a business that is exists to pay the bills or fuel the ego or deal :48 with the insecurities rather than one in this expression of my for lack of it's where my soul's work my calling why :55 I feel I'm on Earth and I just think for me this year has been a Line in the Sand :00 year of I am no longer doing life on autopilot I'm not trying to be someone :05 else that I I feel I need to be I want to be the most authentic expression of myself still figuring it :12 out I haven't figured it out finding my voice still doing all that stuff but it came from the conscious decision of enough is enough and I think that's :19 where a lot of people I think need to get to that point and unfortunately sometimes it takes a lot of pain to get :24 there but if someone can manufacture the point of clarity of just I'm not going to wait until I :31 go through a really hard season of separation or hit low battery mode and burn out and all that but they just pull :36 themselves aside and just get really clear on what they want I think it'll be a huge gift to so many people yeah I think :44 the pain I think pain is essential but I think the suffering is optional and :50 that's why I think these ideas of mentorship of Community are so critical and leadership are so critical to now :57 because they don't don't remove but they mitigate an :03 ease of suffering right what's a terrible analogy I'll go for a :08 terrible analogy if you go on lift weights and you do we're both done CrossFit you do Fran :15 right yeah so you do doing frown on your own and doing it in a room full of :21 people are different things right they both hurt but one you've got to mentally :27 suffer and motivate yourself the other one there's people around you music status all those things and :32 this is where I think the the concepts of Community mentorship are just there not to take the pain away because the :39 difficult questions must be asked and the work must be done but they can definitely mitigate some of the suffering and that's what I'm in it for :46 I'm not trying to take pain away the same as parenting I'd love to take all the pain away from my kids but I also :51 know that they have some dire consequences for them and I think most parents feel that to some degree it'd love to not make them fall over and :58 stumble and have horrible things happen to them but the lessons that the lessons they get from them are :03 Priceless yeah and I see the same as with people and clients and ideas and these things is if you're there :11 and you can mitigate the suffering and make the pain worthy because there's a good why behind it because they're :17 doing they're they're inflicting the right pain on themselves then that's what that's what I'm here for anyway :23 yeah and that and that is the distinction is it's not about is entrepreneurship can be hard even in :30 the midst of it's not a question yeah it's going to be but even in the fun stuff it's we we :36 entrepreneurship is hard because you you never live up to your potential so even if things are easy on the model side :42 you're never satisfied in the sense that there's always more in the tank there's always more that can be accomplished and :47 so heart is difficult because you've got

the distinction is it's not about is entrepreneurship can be hard even in :30 the midst of it's not a question yeah it's going to be but even in the fun stuff it's we we :36 entrepreneurship is hard because you you never live up to your potential so even if things are easy on the model side :42 you're never satisfied in the sense that there's always more in the tank there's always more that can be accomplished and :47 so heart is difficult because you've got to get skills and traits all those types of things but you want the :54 smart type of pain not the foolish type of pain and I think that's where a lot of people get stuck is they :00 are suffering unnecessarily I only forget messaging almost a few years ago I said :07 what do you think of 75 hard and I'll never forget to sit back he said most entrepreneurs mistake difficulty for :13 Progress yeah oh if this is hard the hardest something is the bitter it must be for me right yeah but there is a good :19 training session in the gym and there is a stupid training session in the gym right there is one where you get :25 inadequate recovery where you over stress the muscles where you train so much to failure that you're not in a :32 point of growth you're now injured right and that's where I think most people live in that Redline State yeah :38 but it does have to be that way it doesn't but I do think that you need to go there a couple of times to understand :44 it doesn't need to be that way you've got to touch a few stoves to know that you have I I'm convinced you have to I :50 think we can model I think we can learn I think we can take shortcuts and I think the informational and the and the :56 the connection Advantage we have in the world we live in is yeah ridiculous yeah :01 what a time to be alive but I don't I don't think you can make progress without as you say :08 touching a few stoves yeah I don't I don't think you make your own true progress to understand your preferences :13 yeah because we both know people that we love that have business that have :19 businesses and lives that we would hate but they love them yeah so we both they needed to go through the :25 Journey To Build That Life and if we'd gone through it we would have just had a different path yeah so :32 yeah I think you need to go through you need to do stuff to find out that you don't want to do stuff or which which :38 stuff you want to do more specifically yeah you gotta you got to do seasons of not being yourself to find out who :45 you are yeah yeah and I think as we sit here now today I'm pushing a :51 lot of stuff very hard and I've shared with you in the last few days I'm if I continue to push all the :56 domains I'm pushing and now I'm pushing a lot of things physically I'm putting up pushing a lot of things mentally :02 financially and and with ambition that if I continue to push on all these domains as hard as I'm pushing :07 on all these I'll burn out so soon I'm going to need to make a decision on what's the next season but I'm pushing :14 everything hard to get to a point where I can Coast on a couple of things yeah while I while I push the next thing in :19 the leg up and that to me I wouldn't have had that wisdom even relatively recently it was just :25 push at all costs and Redline out because I've got a high capacity and I think a lot of people fall into that :30 trap because they've got a high capacity they're always trying to find it so they'd go and burn out and try and do do everything push everything run after :37 everything yeah I'm doing 75 hard and I'm going

.com yeah is that what you the domain yeah I own so many I just had to choose one when you do when you :26 brought it up I was this is so random but you you as in you I didn't know you owned it and all of that well :31 my just a little bit of thinking behind that it was I got sick of the I didn't the whole :36 three Secrets thing I'm a full sin person so I'm if you want it use it take it I'm gonna give everything away :43 and give away all the insights and show you behind the scenes and then make a lot of the things that the :49 digital products are making super accessible I just did a hundred dollar thing and if you want help I'm here yeah :55 so to me it was congruent with where I'm at with :00 15 odd years of doing stuff online and making offers and doing seeing millions :06 of them that it was I know a lot of stuff I'm going to share a lot of stuff if you swipe it great if :13 you want some help cool yeah let's go it felt it felt the right :20 thing at the right time yeah and the thing I want to land on because it's reflective of authenticity of finding :25 the right model is you're starting up a daily email or a mostly daily email yeah so talk about why that was important for :31 you to come back to that and of how can people get on that yeah so swipe mymarketing

.com :36 sign up writings writing's been a practice for two decades I write :42 lots of words helps me think daily email is Supernatural and :49 Supernatural very natural for me to do so I can write I can write a couple of :54 things a day and put and put words out really easily and it's always the things I can do consistently are the most :00 important things and what's my highest leverage activity was always the the choice of Max so I sent an email every :05 day I make an offer every day if people want my help if you want to buy something great if they want to :11 unsubscribe great all the offers are on the table so for me it was what can I do consistently what's my highest :17 leverage activity I don't do a ton of video or a ton of other media writing in the word is my thing and so :23 what's my highest leverage activity and and how do I put that out and it's back to back to email back to sending :28 regularly and it's great you get after being on social for so long you get a :35 depth and connection and a privacy and an intimacy that you don't necessarily get in DMS which are short you have :41 people writing War and Peace coming back to you this is this and this I've been through this I've been through this I want to do this does this even exist :47 yeah and you can have proper conversations and and a different pace yeah the online world is :54 something is forgotten the moment it's out there whereas with email and and these things it's it's an ongoing conversation and a depth yeah :00 and at a time in my life when the depth matters much more than the width yeah so it's the right thing at the right time I :07 love it it's also that self-awareness piece right I was we've been hanging out all year more than normal because we're :12 living not together but together and you were talking about writing this ebook I think :18 you're putting out I don't know if you're still putting it out but and then I was out of this guy called danco and he's writing online and so I :23 went through this period of I'm just gonna write yeah miserable I was staring at a blank page of being :29 I hate this I love putting together quick posts but I'm video audio that's my thing yeah and so I love that you've :35 gone back to that because I've I've seen your enjoyment factor of business go up dramatically we were wait a minute there's this thing I used to do that I :42 enjoy doing I stopped doing it and now yeah yeah and so I think that's just a such a simple piece of what :50 do you enjoy doing look at the breadcrumbs of the past and and do more of the stuff you enjoy doing that's a reflection of who you are and less of :56 the stuff that's not yeah but can I share because this is really insightful for people that I'm still jealous of you :02 having a YouTube channel and a Dylan and all these cameras and this and those things and I could subtly convince :09 myself that I should be doing all this right despite that not being my highest leverage and biggest opportunity yeah :14 the thing I should be doing I get it reverse that never goes away I feel exact same way in Reverse self-awareness :20 is because that never goes away I'm damn cool man his thumbnails are sexy and :28 Dylan Dylan and then I'm :33 I'm just gonna write my email I think I think the same way I think about how much better my thinking would :39 be if I wrote every day and I don't get me wrong I'm right often on Facebook but they're not posts or emails or well :45 thought out it's stream of Consciousness no editing posted and it's that funny thing of we always look at the business model of :51 someone else that
