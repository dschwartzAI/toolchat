. Sell an experience, not just features. Make the offer tangible by describing the physical experience of the desired outcome or the removal of the problem.

Tangibility and a clear vision make offers easy to sell. ## Offer Distinction and Positioning: Standing Out in Competitive Markets **Summary:** Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best.

- ```txt ## Proximity to Money **Summary:** To maximize earnings, position yourself as close as possible to the creation, discovery, keeping, and transfer of money. Choosing a less lucrative market is not a moral failing; align your market choice with your desires, skills, and permissions. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** You need to be as close to money as possible, as close to the creation of money as possible, as close to the discovery of money as possible as close to the keeping of money as possible, and as close to the transfer of money as possible. The further you are away from money, the less money you potentially make. This is just the reality, right? And that is not to be looked through a moral lens. Because if you choose a market that makes less money than a market that makes more money, that is not a reflection on you at any moral or practical point. Someone who makes a million dollars a year is not fundamentally a better human being than someone who makes a hundred thousand, right? And in the online world, people link outcomes with morality and goodness, and it means that it often steers people towards places that they either don't want to be, or they have no business in, or they're chasing false idols. So not everyone can or should consciously select the most economically advantageous market. If you wanted to do that all the time you would be opportunity hopping all the time to seek the immediate financial opportunity. There's in markets, for example, right now you'd be selling crypto signals and crypto courses, because that is where the attention flows right. But the reality is that everybody is going to inhabit different marketplaces and positions based on them, their desire, who they want to serve, what problems they've solved before, and ultimately, what you have either the internal or the market permission to do. And this is where we must start, and unless we want to throw out our previous skill set and throw everything away, we have to work with what we have. And the starting point is with a modern brand is that sociological start point. And the start point dictates your current conditions, and your orientation dictates your current direction., think of my path into helping people make money right. I was an entrepreneur, a marketing director. Then I did consulting. I helped people make money at different points all along the way, so I have been very close to the making, the creation, the spending of money all along. So I am in a very advantageous financial position, because I have stayed close to the creation of money for half my life. Right? I've sold things. I've marketed, I've helped people sell things. I've helped people market things. I've helped people build things. I've helped people grow things. I've helped people create things. All of those things were one or two, or three, or sometimes the direct acquisition of money, or they were the direct acquisition of things that give money, customers, or businesses, or audiences, or whatever they may be, right. So it is very natural for me to do the thing that I do, and be in the place that I am because of the skill set that I have and the and the experience that I inhabit. Right now today we have the past, and all leading up to here is the choice that what we do with that, and how we package it and direct it. ## Sociological vs. Psychological Business Approach **Summary:** A sociological business prioritizes your own energy, interests, and desires, building upon your existing skills and experience. This contrasts with a psychological business, which focuses on market demand and data, often leading to chasing trends and compromising personal values. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So your sociological start point is developing the human structure driven by the human energy. So mostly yours in the beginning

. ## Sociological vs. Psychological Business Approach **Summary:** A sociological business prioritizes your own energy, interests, and desires, building upon your existing skills and experience. This contrasts with a psychological business, which focuses on market demand and data, often leading to chasing trends and compromising personal values. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So your sociological start point is developing the human structure driven by the human energy. So mostly yours in the beginning. So I've talked about this, a lot. But the a sociological business is sovereign because it prioritizes your own energy, your interests and your desires over those of the market. Right, it is. You create it from the sheer reality is that the Internet has allowed us to find people us who believe and have the same similar values and similar characters than we do. So it is created in the trust that we can find those people, and they value the same things as us. So this is in contrast to the psychological start point in the market where people go out there and (ask) what does the market want? What does the market, what will the market buy? What does the research say? And what does the data say? Right? So we start with, who do I want to be? A psychological business starts with, who do I need to be, and in the Internet space plenty of people become chameleons in the chase of money. And we start with, what do I want to sell? And they start with what, what will people buy? Right, again, we can choose a marketplace that is, hot and, available right now and jump into it because it's an opportunity. But that doesn't mean that we should play in it. They, we start with what I want this to feel, and they start with what must they do, right? And this is the contrast of the trust that the money, which is the scoreboard of business, comes if we operate with the natural laws that we inhabit, rather than force ourselves into marketplaces or chasing things that we may not be ultimately, naturally aligned with, or ultimately qualified for. So when we get, when we're doing the thing that we're meant to do, I know my purpose, right, and I'm giving everybody permission to find and seek and accept theirs. If you don't know what it is, stop and listen, is all I'll say. If what it is, then, then following it is the path, right? Because then we can operate in a place of curiosity. And interestingly, the money comes in that magical way that the universe does reward us when we're in flow. A sociological brand polarizes, and it's done so naturally, because we talk in the, in the way that is natural to us, to the people that we naturally want to be around, and we repel the others. So a sociological brand serves itself first, and in turn it serves the market by doing that, and it trusts it's serving the market by serving itself. You are the first customer of your brand. The simple lens to look through this: the more I do what I want, the more I am rewarded for that across multiple domains. The more I do what feels right, and then apply a strategic lens to it, the more money I make, the more relationships I build, the more value I create, and the more impact I ultimately deliver, allowing me to do more of those things again. And they all compound, right? ## Building a Sociological Brand: Identity, Mechanism, and Messaging **Summary:** A successful sociological brand needs a unique mechanism for client results, a clear identity clients aspire to, and content that offers glimpses into your past, present, and future. Actively repelling those who aren't your ideal client is also crucial. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan

. And they all compound, right? ## Building a Sociological Brand: Identity, Mechanism, and Messaging **Summary:** A successful sociological brand needs a unique mechanism for client results, a clear identity clients aspire to, and content that offers glimpses into your past, present, and future. Actively repelling those who aren't your ideal client is also crucial. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** At a practical level, when we have chosen and or not chosen, answered the calling, then layering over practical things is the path forward because it manifests those ideas out into the marketplace. Right? So very simply, we have an identity that we can help people transform into and escape the place that they're in and fulfill their desires. We are very clear about what happens when people step into our world. We are very clear about what transformations they undergo, and we are very clear about what they are currently experiencing that they're dissatisfied with, because we know those things already, because they are often part of us. The second, I'd say maybe the first, but one of the critical pieces is having a mechanism that gets a client result in the marketplace of ideas. Being unique is better than being better, right? So having a unique mechanism is a crucial attention seeker and, and, and it allows us to sell the idea of the transformation before the transformation is necessarily undertaken, undertaken or taken place inside our world that we call a client, right? So we need a unique mechanism. We have to be clear about the identity that we, that we have, all the way, maybe to all the way, practically to labeling that, that identity. And we're clear about where people are coming from and doing that, and then we wrap a world around that, and we expose what we are comfortable with in that journey to tell those two stories that A, you're someone who can help transform people, and B, you have a way to do it through your unique mechanism. So you're letting people glimpse into the past, your current present, and a future through the content you produce. Right? And if you want proper depth in this, and I encourage you to go back, I've encouraged a few people to go back and watch it, to understand more depth in it. And I will, I will also do this again in, in 2025 in terms of, to expand on the brand and authority and world building and identity and mechanism, because they are the scaffolding and the framework that hangs off everything. Go and watch the authority which is in the, in the community. The piece that is counterintuitive, but will naturally happen through the course of this, is that you are clear who you are not for, and you actively repel them in your message. Right? And this, repelling does not need to be explicit, right? It can just take a counter position and a narrative on something that is potentially controversial, or is obvious that it will initiate disagreement in a sector or subsector of the market. A working example of that is yesterday I made a video and wrote something about coaching being dead. And it's not, but it's a good headline, and I talked about mentorship. So I drew attention to a point and a, and a semantic point that I wanted to make through the polarization of a whole group of people who want to argue that coaching definitely isn't dead, and they're definitely very good coaches and why can't I see that, etc., etc. And I'm not participating in the argument, but I'm just talking to the people now who are, thank you for reframing some things that I've seen and thought and heard, but I haven't been able to articulate. And can we talk about that a lot more because I took a position on something, right, and I'm not here to argue with the people who want to argue for it

., etc. And I'm not participating in the argument, but I'm just talking to the people now who are, thank you for reframing some things that I've seen and thought and heard, but I haven't been able to articulate. And can we talk about that a lot more because I took a position on something, right, and I'm not here to argue with the people who want to argue for it. I'm here to talk to the people who want to understand that more and how it might ultimately might apply to them. So we take positions in the marketplace that we strongly believe and we can stand on, not to be contrarian and controversial for any particular attention seeking reason, just to surface and articulate things that we know people are thinking to enable a conversation around. So in summary, the checklist is you have at least one unique mechanism, you craft an identity that clients aspire to become, you are letting them glimpse into your past, present, and future through content you produce, and you are clear who you are not for, and actively repelling your message. ## The Power of Transparency and Truth in Content **Summary:** In a low-trust environment, transparency is key. Honest and truthful content, even if not perfectly crafted, attracts the right people by authentically showcasing your experience and values. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The nature of the game these days is, in a low trust environment, is transparency. Communication doesn't need to be good if communication is total. And saying that another way, you don't need to be a good copywriter, or have the skills of content creation, or editing, or making things look pretty or anything, if you are prepared to tell the truth in your content. If you are prepared to tell the unvarnished truth, you don't need to be a wordsmith. You don't need to be articulate. You don't even need to be charismatic. You just need to be honest and true, and people will see that, and they will, they will be attracted towards it because you, you are, you are showing, as much as you can through the, through the methodology of digital content, the true experience of what it would be to be you and ultimately be around you. So the framework of this and the lens that we look through is, if we do this and we commit to it, we sell people on ideas, right? If people are sold on those ideas, they will ultimately be simultaneously sold on us, and ultimately the right people will be simultaneously sold on working with us. Right? I don't do much selling of offers. I do a lot of selling of ideas which then enables me to easily invite people into my offers. I get comments regularly that I just make it look easy and effortless, and it's because of this, because I don't sell, I don't push, I don't coerce, I don't close, because I put my energy into insight, coming out with ideas, helping people apply them, making them work for myself, demonstrating those, and people see those ideas, and over a long enough period of time, the right people say, can I have some help with that? Right? ## The Bedrock of an Effortless High-Velocity Business **Summary:** The key to a successful business is focusing on selling ideas, not offers. By demonstrating valuable insights and their application, you attract the right clients who naturally seek your help. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Right?, the famous question, this is the bedrock of not everything, but this is the bedrock of having an effortless high velocity business and whatever, domain it is. The semantics around coaching, consulting, and, and mentorship will, go well beyond my, my death. But, I'll be there for the, I'll be there for the discussion
