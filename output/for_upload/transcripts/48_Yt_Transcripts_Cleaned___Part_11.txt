# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 11

I don't know what I'm talking about so I've got an idea and I know how these principles apply and I I work from principles but how does how does that layer over so yeah I always feel behind and I always feel feel a certain level of dissatisfied but then I check in with myself on the daily on a on a daily basis about what I'm doing who I'm doing it with and and why I'm doing it to ensure that I'm in the driver's seat of my life rather than than living someone else's life because I've convinced myself there are there are there are better things out there because there's lots of good ideas out there and there's lots of very very convincing people telling you that their idea is the best right and they've got we have all got very good at this myself included I have convinced if you many people that are a one person Consulting business is the panace and definitely the future and for for for many people that's correct and and and for some it's not yeah yeah I think your motto when I started with it I was this fixes every problem it's amazing and then you get a few months into it and you're okay there's some drawbacks yeah okay what's this but I I was just talking to my wife so can I ask can I Dials to tweak ask you a question about that yeah do what dials to tweak within within it now you've got it going well for me it's been a little weird because without trying the affiliate income has gone to a point where I never dreamed it would be yeah and it's just faster easier less effort the most leverage thing I could do and it's recurring and so I'm what does the I enjoy the oneon-one but also there's part of it that's just a grind for me and so I I'm also in Cruise mode where I'm can I just back up and but I'm what I took from you and I'm still taking is there's your Consulting model or your your agency model whatever it is is completely up to you so your thing about stop de or stop demonizing selling your time if you're selling your time for a th an hour that's a great effective rate just sell a 100 hours a year $100,000 if you have some saved you can have a a really amazing life with very few work hours and why would anyone do humanized that so that for me is I do enjoy oneon-one but I I was getting I think caught up in too much too many beginner conversations where I wasn't enjoying the monotony of it yeah and so I'm I'm recalibrating and figuring out how how much of the beginner conversations I want to be having versus the the higher level hey let's let's take this from 50k to 100K instead of let's take this from Zer to five sure yeah yeah one of the one of the ways I look at that and this may be useful to you is is is can I do I want to stop having these conversations or do I want to change the Forum that I have them in right so for me beginner conversations are much more useful in group environments where I can teach teach by demonstration through an example because the distribution of that idea is far more leverag because if there's 40 people on the call and they all take something away from me working with one person then the amplification of that is both more valuable to that individual but also the people who are there so therefore the amplification of that and the satisfaction that I get is much higher I'll have begning conversations all all day long but one of my clients who has 52 million a year I ain't dropping them in a group and saying what are your current problems and how are your 44 team members operating today and what are the numbers and are the kpis we do that via WhatsApp and and jump on a call when we need to because he needs me when he needs me and the availability of that is as is proof of

.1 million and you're that's cool solving problems at scale that didn't happen in a group call and a and a and a school group it happened on a on a phone call then a follow-up a follow-up Zoom where we're pushing things around and writing words so for me I'm always looking to change the the the modality and understand why I'm in that place where I'm I'm not enjoying something because the energy is not there yeah exactly and I think that's it's it's seeing the result for me that makes it worth it yeah and so that's oneoff calls I had a ton of those when I first started out was just oneoff call and then I never hear from the person again I was that was not worth the money that I got paid for that because I I need to know the outcome even if it's bad or whatever this person they just never report back and obviously you can you can reach out to them and usually get a report and I love those ones I I ran into somebody last week just at a local Meetup he's dude we did a Consulting call four years ago I was oh really was it any good and he was yeah I'm doing 30k a month now or whatever and I'm oh that's awesome I wish I I knew more of those stories and so for me I'm I'm I don't I don't want to be on all the time and have to be forced into calls at a specific time or responding within a a certain time frame so I'm trying to figure out is it just a season of the year where I do that because it's fine for a while or is it more taking equity in a few businesses and really being on the front row seat of what the Consulting that I'm doing is is changing for them but I'm luckily in a in a position where the i' again The Accidental affiliate income has has gotten to a point where I've it's opening up my abundance and mindset so much that I can take that time that you were talking about and just take the sabatical figure out what's next type of thing yeah yeah we we we learn through contrast right and what what your journey is helping is the value and the affiliate income which helps you define it and put it in a place where you define it and how much work and effort you want to do to grow it or maintain it or or whatever your decisions are yeah and then to to put yourself in places of contrast to say okay I'm coaching these two people oneon-one one-on-one is the consistent thing the the same modality the variable as the people this person enjoying working with this person I'm not they've both got the same thing but they're different people and I I was I was defining this on on a I have a Syndicate group who get calls with me twice a week around that these businesses are offer driven but human powerered I I can show someone how to make the best offer in the world from her it's easy to sell B but the the the L the the effect of that offer in terms of the delivery of it the stress the energy whatever it is and and subsequently the how long it's going to last selling easily and being fun to run Etc depends on the humans you put in it and in the knowledge economy that's pretty much defines almost everything if we make good offers people will buy them if we work with quote unquote bad people which is just a people who aren't optimal for us then those offers won't last and sustain and they won't give you the results you want and so many people will blame the offer rather than their their decisions in their commitments and their participation around it it's easy to get people to buy stuff but even if I called a 100 people today and offered them a thousand bucks on the phone you wouldn't have 100% close rate that's true and it reminds me and maybe this is just me realizing this in 2024 but I feel 2024 is the

won't last and sustain and they won't give you the results you want and so many people will blame the offer rather than their their decisions in their commitments and their participation around it it's easy to get people to buy stuff but even if I called a 100 people today and offered them a thousand bucks on the phone you wouldn't have 100% close rate that's true and it reminds me and maybe this is just me realizing this in 2024 but I feel 2024 is the lead of or the the year of the quality lead look I don't care about how many come through I care about how many have the money I don't have to arm wrestle into a sale I'm just I'm too old for this type of thing is what I'm hearing for most people even if they're not old and that that plays out on the other side obviously with how difficult they are to manage or how much ener they energy they drain Etc who who do you have to become to be the person or how do you attract the the Attracting Quality Leads quality leads and the quality customers even if you're a beginner there's two levels to this the first the first level of solving old problems new ways right and so the first the first level is old problems new ways just means there's certain things that aren't going away people will always want to look better naked businesses will always want more leads more sales More Money More Revenue more profit better team members Etc so all a lot of people are trying to solve new problems in new ways and no one understands what the heck they're talking about right right so look at old problems what problems that can be solved and what desires are in a Marketplace that you a category that you have permission to play in as in markets are built inside out I came from an e-commerce world and so my first clients were e-commerce because I could talk the talk walk the walk I could I could build inside out because I had market knowledge I knew participants I could speak the lingo and I knew what I was talking about so which which old problem can you solve in a new way in a category that you got permission to play in right and permission to play in might just be going into that category and and busting in the door and getting your first person to solve a problem for an end deploy Skill New Way means I've got a unique mechanism that sits over the top of the Sol problem and I'm solving it and that's how I'm going to get your interest right and so owning and branding your unique mechanism is really critical because it differentiates you in a in a commoditized market because lots of people are trying to solve those problems but when you combine those two things together you get a m a multiplication effect a Compound Effect that's much bigger than one plus one if you help people lose weight but you've got a new mechanism to do it combining the the the the old the old problem with the new way will get you far more attention a far more buying a far more application of those people because humans need humans have based desires but they also need stimulation and they need newness and they need certain levels of dopamine or something new in terms of doing it so they need new ways to to try and solve those problems the second level is is the way to get clients is by not needing clients the way to get money is by not needing it because you you're you're fulfilling your own needs first and you're in a place where you don't need anything from anybody and the closer you can get to that state the more that that will flow in because you've got capacity for it and in the world of Commerce the the the pushiest most aggressive sales people tend to make the most to tend to make the least sales because they project the mo the most need and need doesn't flow to where it's deserved it flows to where there's capacity for it so if someone feels that the only reason you're doing something is because you need the money they're unlikely

from anybody and the closer you can get to that state the more that that will flow in because you've got capacity for it and in the world of Commerce the the the pushiest most aggressive sales people tend to make the most to tend to make the least sales because they project the mo the most need and need doesn't flow to where it's deserved it flows to where there's capacity for it so if someone feels that the only reason you're doing something is because you need the money they're unlikely to give you that money but if someone feels you're doing this because you love it and you care about them and you and and that the result is the only thing that matters then the money is just the the transfer of that of that same energy and if you if you remove the need in yourself for validation through money through clients through being seen as the the the smartest bastard in the room then you'll find that that that power is accumulated indirectly by giving it away and allowing other people to have theirs and your power is is is the fact that you don't need any of it you don't need you don't need any particular person to make you feel whole and complete on that particular day yeah it's so true I was talking to a friend earlier today about how I I don't even see what I do as a business anymore there's no there's no ego wrapped up in it I'm not I'm an entrepreneur that chip on your shoulder you talked about I'm I just found some money glitch on the internet and it happens to be working out for me and that feels infinitely more powerful than having to parade around I know what I'm doing there's a beautiful gratitude wrapped up on that right that I was that that that idea that I was given this opportunity and that the that everything's working in my favor and here I am and it's meant to be and there's there's a beautiful gratitude in that which just says I'm the luckiest bugger on Earth because I get to I get to do this and this is happening for me yeah yeah it's so true so along those lines I feel a lot of beginners who we may have lost already at this point in the conversation but even a lot of advanced people all they talk about is revenue revenue revenue hey I can help you make more money yeah and going to that the quality lead Offer Creation conversation something I've learned from you is the the right people have specific problems that the wrong people don't have and specific desires that the the the wrong people don't have for example I was working with a client in the orthodontic space and he was saying how his orthodontist that he loved the most that was the most qualified and just closed the most people and had grown 2x since they started working together on his Facebook ads was he had gotten more efficient over his 30 years of being an orthodontist and therefore he was able to take on more patience and I was that's the perfect hook for an ad are you an experienced orthodontist with that has gotten more efficient over the years and you want to fill fill the spot so that you're getting as much leverage as possible for the days you're spending in the clinic let's lead into that but on your end I feel I I feel you've given me permission and others permission to be yeah I don't have to be thinking about business doing business having my ego wrapped up into my business 247 in fact it's better if I don't and arguably a more powerful desire for that right person the the orthodontist with 30 years of experience for example is here's how to spend more time with your family not here's how to make more money it reminds me of another hook I heard years ago that was don't sell the dentist Facebook ads ask the dentist you got to talk to the dentist about why the hell they became a dentist and talk to them about how to get out of that because they're probably miserable even though you may not be selling bizops to

desire for that right person the the orthodontist with 30 years of experience for example is here's how to spend more time with your family not here's how to make more money it reminds me of another hook I heard years ago that was don't sell the dentist Facebook ads ask the dentist you got to talk to the dentist about why the hell they became a dentist and talk to them about how to get out of that because they're probably miserable even though you may not be selling bizops to dentists you need there there's a lot of people that need a different approach or or need to be pitched in a different way does that make sense yeah so the thing I talk about is currencies right and so there's there's predominantly in an offer creation three pretty simple currencies one of them is the is almost infinite and two of them are measurable so there's just money in bizop and business coaching and even an agency World it's you are selling money right you give me $2,000 a month to run your Facebook ads and build your funnel and I'm going to give you $20,000 a month worth of business bag right it's just money Arbitrage you give me small amount I give you big amount is the is the is the promise then there's a Time factor which Le also leads the energy factor is that at a certain time people have a feeling of enough in terms of the money category and they feel they can move to a Time category that they want time back but what they're really doing is wanting energy back so my and I don't any of the language that we all use around low and high level and good and bad clients and people because I don't my my findings is none of those things really exist they're just perspective at a certain place at a certain time with with a particular individual but they're useful in the designation of this but high high level people want energy back more than anything right because we have a finite life and we understand we have a a certain amount of energy life force energy and we have a certain amount of time time to use it and we want to use it to the best of the abil of our abilities and then we have meaning around the things that we use our energy for ourselves our family and and these pieces so the selling of energy is you know to that to that orthodontist we just need to give them ways to measure it right ways to measure energy is you've been you've been in business for 20 years and it used to take you it used to take you five days to to serve 40 patent 40 patients in the chair and now you can do that in two and then it gives them and say and then you can spend the other three days playing golf with your family and and planning your retirement out and I'll help you plan your retirement out and an exit for your orthodontic business and and how to have enough cash flow for the for the rest of your life and so you can have intergenerational wealth that you pass down to your children and your grandchildren right and then they can start then they're starting to build a picture of okay I'm going to use my effort and that I've put in over the last 20 and that competence that I've built by being able to serve 40 patients in half the time into the things that matter to me and you paint a picture of that and that's what copy that's what copywriting does right it just allows us to paint a picture of the future that doesn't exist yet for someone and then allowing them to be Rel make it relevant to themselves so the the the low level the the surface level is is selling money the secondary level is is is selling time to some degree and the infinite game is is is is being in in the market to sell energy and then using the modalities that we have to to do that and in terms of service and delivery there's there's only really four and you just mix those modalities based on your Skool set

that doesn't exist yet for someone and then allowing them to be Rel make it relevant to themselves so the the the low level the the surface level is is selling money the secondary level is is is selling time to some degree and the infinite game is is is is being in in the market to sell energy and then using the modalities that we have to to do that and in terms of service and delivery there's there's only really four and you just mix those modalities based on your Skool set four modalities to sell energy you mean four modal to serve so we've got coaching Consulting mentorship and Service delivery right and Service delivery is just I'll do this thing for you and it it is nothing else I I'll do this thing for you I will spend $110,000 a month on Facebook ads for you to this funnel and this will happen you will have leads in your calendar and you call them on the telephone right yeah and it and it ends there we wrap a lot of stuff around it but service delivery is just doing something for somebody mentorship mentorship is this is how I would do it so my high level mentorship is people asking me how I think about things and how I've done things in the past that have got success that they want to replicate and I say this is how I do it this is how I think about it Consulting is telling people how to do something and then in the modern pance of consult Consulting is it's doing it with them so your traces of knowledge are left after you stop Consulting your system your ideas your philosophy is left there because you've done it with them and it's been embedded in the in the business got it and coaching has helped someone see that they've already got the things inside them to do the required action help someone see and give them Insight enough to get them to do the thing that they need to do that they're telling you that that we ultimately move them forward and we switch between those modalities naturally a lot of agencies do a ton of Consulting but they don't get paid for it and that's a gigantic opportunity for almost every agency to have a Consulting level in their business that just does Consulting and monetizes it because it's very high margin and high value work and business and so people are unconsciously do change between those modalities when they they're being a coach or even being an agency owner or being a consultant but those modalities when you understand the the what they are and how to deploy them that it opens up a world of opportunity about how you can use them either as individual products sell them as individual products but also serve people better in that time you've been on my on my group calls with folks and I and I ask permission to consult to them if I've got time and space I'll coach someone because that will leave the longest lasting Legacy because they they'll be able to do it themselves if we don't have time and they and they're floundering around as can I just consult you and tell you the answer and you going and do it and 99 times out of 100 they say yes right because they're looking to they're looking for the the life raft out of it but when you use these modalities you can serve people a lot better but in the process of that you serve yourself a lot better you serve yourself a lot better is that what you said yeah because Serving yourself you're because why why are you serving yourself better with those modalities because you're setting the correct expectations and life and a and a and a human world is about expectations and if you don't if you if you coach someone to do something but you're telling them what they want and what to do and you think you're coaching them but you're Consulting to them you're setting an expectation that this thing is going to be right for them rather than allowing to discover it themselves and that will Downstream have an effect on their application of that piece their their their results from it and ultimately their desire to continue it
