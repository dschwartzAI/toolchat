# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 10

> "Go in, just do $2,739 a day. Go, just go and do it, right, that's it. And you'll do a million dollars a year,"
 right? Easy. But it's flat, in the act of doing that 365 times, a lot of shit happens, right? You want to make 3 million a year? Okay, all you need to do is make $57,692 a week. you can do that. Just go and do it. Math. So math is very flat, and when we get out into the world, our experience is not linear, right? And, and growth is not linear either. So let's start with some concepts. Recurring revenue businesses are the, are the most robust over the long term, right? And I've been very honest that for the most part of this year, I've coasted from a revenue growth acquisition. I hit the number I wanted to hit, and then this was, 
> "Sweet, I don't have to put a hell of a lot more energy into this. I can just oscillate and maintain around that, around that pace."
 And I will go, as someone who's obsessed, it's weird, weird to say this, but I will go days without thinking much about the business. I will just be operating on it and, and inside it. And then I'll look at the Stripe account, and it's got six or seven or $8,000 in it, and I'll go, 
> "Okay, cool. Yeah, sweet. It's still there, right? It's still, it's, it's, it's still there. It's still coming,"
 because that revenue was booked and sold months, weeks, months, or in some cases, years ago. So recurring revenue businesses are the most robust over the long time, over the long term. ## The Paradox of Recurring Revenue **Summary:** While recurring revenue offers long-term robustness, it's important to remember that it's not guaranteed. The only true revenue is the money collected today, and lowering revenue volatility is crucial for emotional stability and effective operation. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The paradox is that recurring revenue does not arrive in the amounts expected, and the revenue you collect now is the only true revenue. Give me one minute. Someone's locked two dogs in the office with me. I'll be, be tense. Yeah, don't, don't edit that out, Alex. It's just, it's just stupid. I wonder why they were getting so grumpy around the corner. Recurring revenue is a difficult concept, and I, and I dug into that, a couple of workshops ago around the acquisition of it because it doesn't happen how people think it does, right? And the, the reality is that the only true revenue is now revenue. The only true revenue is the money you collect today that settles and ultimately, comes into your business bank account because when we sell our product that is intended to recur, we are incurring our future liability to deliver on that. And also we are incurring an expectation that if someone says they're gonna be there for 12 months and they're paying, "See the tab. People tag," week, but they will be there for 12, "Week," again. That doesn't often happen. So the, the classic, the map is not the terrain that kneecaps most everybody because they're, 
> "I've got recurring revenue, it's gonna keep coming."
 And then it's a lot more volatile than people think, and volatility is the thing we must lower. So this is the most important sentence that I will say in the, in this section ============================================================ # SOURCE FILE: all_transcripts_combined_part_6.txt

- ```txt ## Congratulations on Engagement **Summary:** James Kemp discusses his recent engagement and the nuances of relationship labels in the modern world. Video Source:* Authority workshop.txt **Content:** We were joking this morning in the modern world. you have girlfriend, you have, partner, you have all these words, and you never quite know what fits and when I call her my partner. I just feel it's my homosexual life partner. and go. Doesn't seem quite fitting, so Fiance's just. I think so. ## Book Funnels: What They Are and What They Aren't **Summary:** James Kemp explains the purpose of a client-getting book, emphasizing its role in selling a simple idea and creating customers who can be converted into clients. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Gonna talk about books! What they are, what they aren't as I think the idea that people have in their head of what a book is, I believe, stops most people starting. and the what they can do and what you need to add to them to get to turn them into a long term. Asset is is powerful. So what a book is and isn't. And I, this is this is the big one because I got stuck here., back in the day of this is a book. and this is a client. The the reference we're talking about today is a client getting book. It is not your autobiography by Walter Isaacson. That's not one that you give to your grandmother. It's not one that you read to your kids. It is not your life story. Maybe one day you'll do that. The the goal of this book is to sell them on a simple idea. And that's why the definition of this book can be brought down to, a 30 to 50 page book that someone consumes and sells them on the idea. And in many cases I've seen and also done converting a long lead magnet into a short book. Because it already works can be an effective way of thinking about it as well. The second piece of what the book does is it sells an idea. The goal of the book is to sell just one of your ideas right? And you, you all of you, have more than one. ## The Power of a Book: Selling Ideas and Creating Customers **Summary:** A book effectively sells an idea, making potential clients more receptive to the author. It also creates a customer base that can be nurtured into long-term clients through further engagement and offers. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So once someone has bought into the idea that makes them more likely to buy into you., I talk a lot about we sell ideas first, st and we sell. we sell clients. Second. but the book is there to sell them on the idea. So the book doesn't hold back from the things that are required to sell the to sell the idea. It has everything it needs to sell the idea. But that's that's the only goal of it. And of course, in the in the sovereign world. What a book does is it creates a customer. Once a book is sold it creates a customer, and we turn those customers into clients. The book fulfills more of the criteria, just workshops do or or anything that's got a high level of consumption. The more time on Brand, and the more time that someone spends consuming you, consuming your ideas. the easier they are to convert into becoming a client, and the longer they stay in your world. . We've been talking a little bit over the last couple of weeks about content. my Youtube strategy and my video strategy. And that's about, brand Width, it's about getting people on brand and consuming one or some or all of the ideas that you have. So by the time that they're reaching out, or you're having a conversation about an offer

. the easier they are to convert into becoming a client, and the longer they stay in your world. . We've been talking a little bit over the last couple of weeks about content. my Youtube strategy and my video strategy. And that's about, brand Width, it's about getting people on brand and consuming one or some or all of the ideas that you have. So by the time that they're reaching out, or you're having a conversation about an offer. they are already sold on those things, and you are the origin of them. ## Books as Evergreen Assets and Client Generation Tools **Summary:** Books are highly evergreen marketing assets, remaining relevant and effective for years. They offer excellent value and can generate clients even without complex funnels, though distribution and economics are key for maximizing their potential. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So in the Internet space. And in in the online space the rate of change is super super high, things come and go and they fizzle out and they disappear really, really, quickly, and their effectiveness and a book is an interesting one, because as an asset, it's 1 of the most evergreen I can't think of an asset that's more evergreen than a book, really, because even a workshop or a webinar would need a that can, that they can feasibly run for years, they still need to be changed and refreshed and updated where there are plenty of examples of books that are 10 or even 15 years old that are still selling in the market today. ## Creating a Book: A Simpler Process Than You Think **Summary:** Creating a client-getting book is often simpler than anticipated, frequently achievable in a weekend or less by compiling existing materials. The most time-consuming aspect is editing for readability and usability. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So how do we create a book? It is a lot simpler than you think. The creation of all my books has been done in a weekend or less right because they were. They were compiled, and amalgamations of things that are already done honestly, that the most of the time spent on books is editing. So editing is just making it readable and making it usable. And once you've got a baseline down then most of the time is making it editable, making it readable and making it consumable. ## How-To Books and Mechanism Books: Delivering Results and Converting Clients **Summary:** How-to books that provide complete solutions are most effective for client conversion. Books focused on a single mechanism are also highly effective, especially for problem-oriented solutions. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So I I believe that the best books and I have found that the best books are how to books. They give everybody. They give somebody everything they need to ultimately fulfill on the idea. So they tell them. You tell them how to do the thing so they could spend $10 with you and do that, or they could spend a hundred grand with you, and, and get you to do it for them. So books that hold back create customers that will hold back on you. So if you leave out the secret ingredients or leave out the key thing out of the book. You will find that that book doesn't ultimately convert people books that give people everything in terms of the central idea and the central concepts., indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person. ## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism **Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop

., indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person. ## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism **Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So there's 2 types of books that we can create. The 1st one is the big idea. the one that completely sells them and if you want to get more context on the sovereign consultant and the pieces of how I assembled that watch the authority training in the classroom. but the big idea completely sells them on your whole vision, your whole world, who they who they can become what they need, what they need to do next, and and ultimately how they do it. The the why, what, how, so? The sovereign consultant is A is an example of a big idea book. It's a big idea that creates the idea of what a sovereign consultant is. what they need to do to do it, and how to do it. As they unpack the chapters. So, the the Big Idea book is more of the book than our book, slightly contradicting what I said before, but it's it's ultimately the the big idea. the second type of book which I'm confident that 80% of you have now is a book that's just about a single mechanism. ## From Trainings to Books: Leveraging Existing Content **Summary:** Existing training materials and workshops can be easily repurposed into books. Transcribing workshops and blending them with training documents provides a substantial base for a book, requiring primarily editing and structuring. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the sovereign consultant book is created from 4 trainings. So there's a software consultant the the simplest path to a million dollars profit a year. You can see that training. You can see that it's got a Google Doc attached to it. The hybrid offer customers to clients in the data client machine. So, as I said, I will create 3 more books based on those mechanisms. So I will have an interconnected world of books that that point to each other and cross reference each other. Because I've already got the baseline of those books. So what I did is, I created a training. I ran the workshop. I got the workshop transcribed, and then I blended the the original training Doc, because I do my trainings in in Google Docs. And I blended that with the transcript of the of the workshop. The average hour long workshop generates about 17 to 24,000 words depending on how fast you speak. That's a book right? There is editing required, but you can have something usable and drop it into drop it into those, and I'm going to give you the book and the outline, and in a more readable and raw format. ## Simplifying the Book Creation Process: Focusing on Client Acquisition **Summary:** Client-getting books should be viewed as enhanced lead magnets or condensed workshops, focusing on client acquisition rather than being complex literary works. This approach simplifies the process and allows for quicker client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** This is a lead magnet on steroids or a reduction of a workshop. Right? And again, most people here have done both of those things, and the book is the happy middle ground in terms of the asset that is created from those, and also an asset that ultimately we can put into something that's got bit better economics

. This approach simplifies the process and allows for quicker client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** This is a lead magnet on steroids or a reduction of a workshop.

A shorter, focused book created quickly can be more effective for generating clients. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I think the point you made, a book, not the book is is huge. I think that's a massive thing that most people just they see, all of the Russell Brunson's, and they see, Dan Martell, buy back your time, and they're man. These books are massive, we've got to do best seller and all this crap. And it's just., that's that's great for them, and where they're at, and their status in life, and what they're trying to accomplish. But for you, you most likely want to get clients from your book. And so the the book doesn't need to be. Doesn't need to be a thing, and it it should just be a a machine in the cog, for where you're at right now, and what you want to achieve from the book and I'm sure those guys get clients because they have these massive things that they're putting out there. But that's that's, probably 2 years worth of work to create one of those assets and to to create a marketing campaign around that. And it's just, I'd rather you guys turn out a book in a weekend and get clients next week. ## Framing Your Book Around Client Problems and Solutions **Summary:** Chris Benetti advises focusing on the core problems clients face and creating a book that offers solutions and a clear path to working with you. This simple approach can be highly effective for client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** and and I think it's more simple than we think. So the the thing from my perspective that I to just talk about is is the frame. So a lot of a lot of people work with you guys because you have a solution to offer, and they're likely struggling with a core common problem. And so if we can just identify what that problem is, and then write a book that, talks about the solution right then and there, and then a pathway to how they can work with you to achieve that thing. Then that's a very simple cycle that we can control and create. And it doesn't need to be complicated. ## Mechanism Books, Client Acquisition, and the Path to Traditional Publishing **Summary:** Mechanism-focused books often outperform big idea books in sales due to their problem-solving nature. A client-getting book can also pave the way for traditional publishing opportunities later on. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** Those the mechanism books sell better than the big Big idea books, because they're more immediate and they're more problem focused. So the daily client machine was very, very easy book to sell. It had a very high conversion rate, and it had a very high conversion rate off the back end, because the the this is how you get clients every day is a, a common thing that's top of mind. So the mechanism books are a little bit easier to sell them, anyways, because they're more problem orientated and solution orientated than

. So the daily client machine was very, very easy book to sell. It had a very high conversion rate, and it had a very high conversion rate off the back end, because the the this is how you get clients every day is a, a common thing that's top of mind. So the mechanism books are a little bit easier to sell them, anyways, because they're more problem orientated and solution orientated than . A concept the sovereign consultant where someone's going to look and look at what's that? Just to close off on the book idea? Our book can lead to the book. I've been approached by publishers twice over the years and said. You've got a book, and you've got an audience and you've got. Do you want to write a book? The book with us so. But I wouldn't have been able to have those conversations, and someone reach out until I had a book out there in the 1st place. ## Book Economics and the Importance of Distribution **Summary:** Maximizing book sales requires effective distribution, which in turn necessitates sound economics. The goal is to create a funnel that allows for paid traffic and ideally generates enough revenue to cover ad costs, making customer acquisition free. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the the book and the economics matter a lot . Candidly, you could write a book, stand alone and not do any of the funnel things, put it on. Amazon. Run a basic funnel to it. You get clients right. It can be a really effective customer and client generation tool on its own., there's plenty of people have built pretty okay, little businesses just having a book and not thinking about any of the economics. But to maximize the book and the economics, we need to have distribution right to maximize any asset we need to have distribution. So we need maximum economics to maximize that distribution because we can do something that is the unicorn of of marketing. We can get the product to pay for itself. So we need to plan its economics and create a funnel which allows us to run paid traffic to the book. ## Self-Liquidating Book Funnels and Ad Tracker Transparency **Summary:** James Kemp shares his ad tracker, demonstrating how a well-structured book funnel can be front-end profitable, covering ad costs and even generating profit. Transparency in tracking, including agency fees, is crucial for understanding true funnel economics. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the the simple goal we have for this is to generate enough revenue from the product sales to cover ad costs. So here's the tiny Tiny. He doesn't make it. This Tiny. He lets me read it. Here's the here's the the a snapshot of the ad tracker that Chris and his team do for do for me every day. So Alex uploads the the sales numbers, and then Chris puts the the ad spend in including his fee. and remember that, when you're looking at outgoings. If you work with anybody in an agency, a lot of agencies will pretend that the fee doesn't exist, and it's just, it's all gravy. But the but Chris puts his fee in here. So it's super transparent about what the actual economics of the funnel is. ## The "More of the Same" Principle in Book Funnels **Summary:** Book funnels should offer additional products and resources that expand upon the core idea presented in the book. This "more of the same" approach caters to different consumption preferences and maximizes the value offered within the funnel. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** when I asked Chris yesterday, I'm, What's the what's the message about the book funnel ? What's the how should people think about it? He said. Something that's, very simple in terms of its concept, which is more of the same. If someone is buying the book
