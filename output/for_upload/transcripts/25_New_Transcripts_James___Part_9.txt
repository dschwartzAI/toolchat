# New Transcripts James - Part 9

. I do. I just form a, an idea of a future that someone that I wanna live and, and, and, and trust that other people are gonna wanna live that too. Yeah. And then, and then, what, what, what financial needs do I have that I need to meet in terms of obligations and rationally take actions that meet those. you say, if you've gotta pay rent, go and get some f*****g money to pay the rent. Yeah, totally. But that's a, that's a practical, that's a practical, action after you've done the other two. Yeah. Because you've, you've, you're understanding that you're taking that action not out of, being upset that your mommy doesn't love you. It's that you are, that you're gonna make money that, that to pay the rent or whatever you need because you have financial needs. Those, those, but those things are, those things can be separated. Yep. Your need for money is not feeding the need you think it is. So go and find the need that you have that to be fed and go and make money A need underneath it. Yeah. Yeah. I'll, I'll quickly share my 2 cents on this and then I want to talk about some tactical funnel stuff. I think everyone will find really valuable., I think about it this, everyone has two categories of things that they don't want to do in their business. One of them would fall under conveniences. So for me, I'll, I'll just be so clear, right? No sales calls is a convenience., I hate sales Calls. Can I, can I just, can I just say, do you, can you imagine how much money would make if we added a sales team to our businesses? It would be absurd. Dude. Can you imagine how many kgs I would gain if I added a sales team? You imagine, How do you imagine how much I would end up going back to drinking IPAs every day if that Happened? Oh dude, man, the life we could be living right now, it sounds so God amazing, God rich and miserable. Sign me up, lamb, Rambos and jet. Sorry. Alright, so let's get practical. Okay, so, so in in people's, I don't want to do this list. There are conveniences and convictions. Sales calls for me are a convenience, dude, if it's between me and my family, paying rent next week, bro, I'm gonna book out my calendar now. I'm gonna try and do it in my way. I'm gonna go take the calls on a walk, we'll do no video, but I'll be happy to talk to you all day if that's what it comes down to. But then there are convictions. And so if we're talking about what feels light and what feels heavy, there is, and I wanna be so emphatically clear because I believe in a very abundant universe, there is no situation you will ever face where there is not an aligned path for you to walk forward. I don't believe there is ever a time where the only path forward is when, where you have to compromise your convictions. Now I'm telling you right now, if you believe that you're gonna have to compromise your convictions, sometimes you will always find the path to compromise the convictions. But I do not believe any of us have to betray our values, betray our convictions to make money. I don't care how scarce it is, how, how badly you need to pay rent. And if you don't believe me, why don't you take it all the way to the nth degree? Do you ever believe that you're gonna have to pay that, that to pay rent, you would have to sell your body or kill someone. Now those are extreme examples

. But I do not believe any of us have to betray our values, betray our convictions to make money. I don't care how scarce it is, how, how badly you need to pay rent. And if you don't believe me, why don't you take it all the way to the nth degree? Do you ever believe that you're gonna have to pay that, that to pay rent, you would have to sell your body or kill someone. Now those are extreme examples. So then why would we take that in the lighter ways and go, oh yeah, it's not quite that bad. But also I don't wanna do it., I'll be really clear and pragmatic on this. There is never a situation where you should take money from someone you do not wanna work with. Now if you do not have an abundant mindset and you are scared, you are gonna take that money and you're gonna find a way to make it work. And I promise you, you're gonna regret it. So my belief is that yes, there are seasons where money, challenges us and stretches us to let go of conveniences, but I do not believe we ever find ourself in this situation so bad that we have to compromise on the convictions of who we are. I believe in an abundant universe, I believe everything is always working out for us. I believe all of creation is unconditionally supporting us. And you may not share that belief, but I promise that however you believe the universe will show up or will not show up for you is exactly what you'll receive. If you are constantly stuck in the feast and famine cycle of survival, you will never leave that unless you believe that there is another path always available to you. One that's aligned, one that allows you to do stuff you want to do with people you want to do it with. I think the world is just such an abundant place. I met a lady at the farmer's market the other day who was one of the best in the world at hu at Honey. So she's been making honey for the last 20 years, has been taking it to the world and has I tried the third best honey in the world? Dude, it was amazing. And so we're in this society, in this amazing time in humanity where you can make a unbelievable living knitting. I I met this guy who makes a full-time living, making pens at the farmer's market, right? Custom pens that look bullets. They're amazing. I believe for us as coaches and as value creators and as consultants, there is always an aligned path available to us. We just have to look for it and expect it., and That, that is, that is is wealth as well. Yes. Yes. But you will never see it if you don't believe it's there. You will always find what you're looking for. All right. Funnels less, less esoteric chat for a moment. That was a f*****g hand break by the way, and a left turn. The reason I wanna bring this up is because, I think you and tariffs, I can get so deep, let's talk about tar. So, alright, Elon Musk, doge, let's talk about it., no, no go. I wanna talk about funnels because I think, I think this is a, a really connected idea. So I think my core conviction is that we often don't make as much money as we should be making because we are not making it easy for people to give us money. I want everyone to do a self audit right now. How easy do you think you are making it for people to give you money? And the big lesson for me this year has just been the simplicity of having huge neon signs in my world to the next step through the funnel

. So I think my core conviction is that we often don't make as much money as we should be making because we are not making it easy for people to give us money. I want everyone to do a self audit right now. How easy do you think you are making it for people to give you money? And the big lesson for me this year has just been the simplicity of having huge neon signs in my world to the next step through the funnel. And so if I was to create a starter pack for, I'm a broke coach, and I don't know why number one would be, I never talk about my offer, right?, there are people who never talk about their offer and then they wonder why no one's buying. And I'm, you have to be talking about what you do. The second thing is, for the broke coach starter pack, and I dunno why is I'm not talking about my offer in a way that sounds appealing to the people I'm trying to appeal to. So you simply cannot say, if you want to work with me, unless you have a big audience of people filled with people who want to work with you, you have to be crystal clear in your messaging. You have to focus on them, not you. You have to articulate what's in it for them, not you. You have to be really clear. The third thing is you have to create a journey of easy yeses from stranger to paying customer to high paying client. And so whether you have the, the customer piece, let's just take this for example. Most of us have short freebie content and then we have big expensive thing. And so a prime example is people who only post short form style content and then they go, if you wanna work with me, book a call here. And the the leap from, from where they are to this one huge yes is monumental, which is why people have no shows and have three follow up calls. And, that's why people, you can have a hundred thousand Twitter followers and make no money because that audience is built off short content and is not a journey of easy yeses. So pragmatically for me, having a central focal point of a VA video sales letter, just continue to proves to be the most profitable thing that I could have and the most important thing that I could ever point people towards. So whenever I make that the focal point, that the next step in the journey, I make more money whenever I go, weeks and lead flow feels drier, I can always point to the fact that either I need to create a new VSL, which doesn't happen all that often, or I'm just simply not talking about it. So when I post on my stories multiple times a week, I have a VSL, you should check it out. I get more leads and make more money when I put it as the PS of my emails. It's, it, it, it works clockwork. And so for me, this big lesson of number one, making it easier for people to give you money, don't put the hard work and burden on their shoulders for them to figure out who, who your work is for how they work with you. And then number two, don't just make it easier for them to make, give you money through a sales conversation. Create a journey of easy yeses, move them to your longer form content, move them to your products, move them to your video sales letter. Allow them to go through that journey of more consumption before they get to the sales conversation

. And then number two, don't just make it easier for them to make, give you money through a sales conversation. Create a journey of easy yeses, move them to your longer form content, move them to your products, move them to your video sales letter. Allow them to go through that journey of more consumption before they get to the sales conversation. So any, any notes on that or anything that you've, I know you don't have a VSL so to speak, but anything that you've learned or been reminded of this year around this topic? Yeah, I, I, it's interesting the concept of VSL, because, a video sales letter, I would, I would argue that every time you go on video, you're making a video sales letter for an idea. Correct. And so the, the, the easy, the easy yes. After you create content is that what is the natural thing to point someone towards, to take the next step. Mm-hmm. And so I think if you're thinking about content, if you're thinking about ads, if you're thinking about anything is what is the na If you're selling someone an I on an idea, what is the natural next step for that person to take? Right. And natural, which is, I feel good about saying, I've just talked about this, I've just talked about this result a client's got or, or whatever, Hey, you can buy this thing for nine bucks, or you can come to this workshop, next week for, for free, or whatever it may be. But it's just, it's, it's the, it's empathy. It's the height of, if I was in someone's shoes and I stimulated and I stimulated some level of interest in this idea, what's the natural thing for them to do next? Because I think a lot of people to stop and a lot of people to stop and they don't make the offer because they've made the content for themselves, which is very common., because they wanted to get something off their chest that they're frustrated with, or, or an idea. And they also just don't think about what is the natural next step, because I think everything's a sales letter., because we are in the market of selling ideas, and some of those ideas need to be consumed in, in, in environments where people get the adequate support to, to fulfill on that idea, which is a paid product or a mm-hmm. Or a client experience, whatever it is. So yeah, I think it's just that the natural piece of, if you're making content, then put a put the natural next step. And we call that strategically a call to action. Mm-hmm. But what is the natural next step?, I'm running, it's close to a thousand dollars a day in ads at the moment, and it's, oh damn, dude. It's what's the natural next step? Right? Yeah. Well, I'm, they're four line ads Yeah. Saying, I've got this, it's good. Buy it. Yeah. Oh, by the way, when you buy this thing, this can, this cash campaign, this 11 email sequence, it goes really well with that. So maybe you should buy that by the, that's all makes sense. I've got a, I've got a, I've got a place where I've got 40 more of these things. Yeah. Do you wanna come in and try it for nine bucks? Yep., it's just, I, there is also something in back to vibes. Yep. If you don't feel good about your offer and you don't feel good about what it does and who it's for and, and, and how it's done, you won't want to promote it

. Yeah. Do you wanna come in and try it for nine bucks? Yep., it's just, I, there is also something in back to vibes. Yep. If you don't feel good about your offer and you don't feel good about what it does and who it's for and, and, and how it's done, you won't want to promote it. You don't feel good about the communication, you won't make it. Mm-hmm. You won't talk to it. You won't put it out there. And so everything we are saying isn't natural. So if you don't feel good about your offer on all dimensions, the price, the promise, who it's for, what they get, then you're not gonna make it. So you have to have con you put, put conditions up where I to think that people are stealing from me. I'm, this is absurd that I'm giving this much for $9 or $50 a week, or $250 a week, or whatever it might be. Yeah. I feel good when that happens. So therefore I do it a lot. A hundred percent. There's so many directions I want to go in., I would love to know just in the chat, what's coming up for you guys? What are some takeaways so far?, because the, I have a number of things listed out. I know, I know James has, but I'd love to know, what's coming up for you as an aha moment?, I, dude, my phone is overheating and I can't really, it's just getting dimmer and dimmer by the second, but I'm just rolling with it. And for whatever reason, my computer is internet list or some, or something., but, what, what, what's coming up for people? James, black t-shirts or, in Bali tank tops. Yeah. That's the uniform. Elizabeth, I didn't know you went by Elizabeth these days. I thought it was, I only, I I, I call her that. Every, every now and then, mache are talking to, well, let's young lady, let's talk about this for a second., there's this whole idea of authenticity and content, right? And the basics are, the basics are share about your life, share about yourself, right? Don't just, don't just teach what, bring people into your world. But I feel it's so much deeper than that. And it's almost a skill. what have you been learning in the last, the last three to six months around that element of ethos, personal brand, people buying into you, not just ideas, because obviously this connects to this idea of mentorship. How, how do you think about it these days? So when I, when I think about building a brand, there's, there's three components, right? There's, the identity that we help people manifest. There's the mechanisms that we use, marketing 1 0 1. This is my unique mechanism, but then there's this overarching piece of the world, ? And, and in my community I'll talk about, what world are you building? Who are the characters in it? And those pieces. What I think this has been happening for a long time, but what I have noticed is that we are shifting the, the what has been so commoditized, funnels, webinars, ads, low ticket, high ticket closing, and those things, they're so easy to replicate, right? And before you'd slap a f*****g unique mechanism and a little TM on the side and everyone would go, this is new. Oh my God, it's so amazing. And, I still give that advice 'cause it's still kinda work, right? Yeah

. Oh my God, it's so amazing. And, I still give that advice 'cause it's still kinda work, right? Yeah. We learned that from t in there and, call it something new even though it's not that new, right? And, and that, that was enough to, to get some traction and solve a problem. The, as the trust has declined in the media that we see across the whole, across everywhere from mainstream media all the way to social media, as trust has declined, people are looking through the surface stuff, the strategies, the mechanisms, even the identity and going, who is this person and what are they really doing behind this stuff? Right? So it's been harder for the fakers to fake the things because the, the fake things, you can't be consistent when you're lying. Right? So that eventually you get found out. Yeah. And so the world component of the brand is that people are looking through the surface stuff, the mechanisms, the products and those pieces and saying they're commodities. But who is this person? Where are they going? Who is going with them? What is ha They're looking through into the world, the physical world that people have in terms of their life, but also the, the, the virtual world that people have built in terms of their client, the community, and who's in it and, and, and where it is because people are looking for truth. Right? And that, so before you could slap a TM on something, say it was a unique mechanism and make a million dollars., it's kind of still available in a way if you, if you're good at it. Yeah. Yeah. But people are buying a lot more who than they ever have. Yeah. What are you doing, et cetera. And that is values and character based and truth based. So doing things that people can't replicate 'cause they're real is, is the best marketing that anyone can produce, right? It's the, it's, it's not marketing. It's showing in demonstration. And increasingly in a, in a world where people don't trust stuff, they want to, they want to see it, feel and touch it before they buy it. And so, making thing, making yourself someone who is easy to buy from is a product of letting people see who you are and who you really are. And also highlight bits that you want to clean up because you might not wanna show other people. And so the, so marketing is dying because marketing at a base level is manipulation because it manipulates someone into having a belief that they may not possess. Yeah. And, and it to, to get a short term transaction and demonstration and showing is, is, is growing. So that's why people are watching more long form content. That's why people are watching three hour podcasts with, politicians and those things, which sounds hell to most people, but they're looking for the, they're looking through something to, to the truth be, well, you can't, you can b******t me over 30 seconds, but you can't b******t me over three hours. Right? Right. And so the depth that we, that we need to come from in terms of what we're showing people, I think is, is just gonna be significantly, significantly deeper rather than wider of, I'll just come up with a new mechanism. I'll just come up with a new tactic. And that is good for the good people and terrible for the terrible people because you, you can't, you can't innovate. You can't innovate and outrun it fast enough 'cause the economics don't make sense. 'cause the tension has just got so expensive. Yep. Yeah. I think this is a huge lesson for everyone on this call. No matter your niche, no matter your offer
