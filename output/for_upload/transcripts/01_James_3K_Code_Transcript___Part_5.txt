# James 3K Code Transcript - Part 5 & Customers To Clients

. James Kemp: It doesn't. It doesn't need to be relevant. Then it just needs to be congruent with the people you're talking to. Right? Yeah.. James Kemp: there are many, many ways that people could get help to have a million dollar consulting business right? Hire a team and do this and this. I have my way James Kemp: right? So my way as congruent James Kemp: to me. James Kemp: very, very relevant to me. And then I just make the assumption that it's congruent to James Kemp: a lot of other people Arc: right? And then, Val, and then it's validated through the market. James Kemp: Yeah. And and remember, remember. the more polarizing. James Kemp: the more polarity something has. the more strongly something repels, the more strongly it attracts James Kemp: in every single case right? But people try and vanilla and distill and things and go. James Kemp: yeah, yeah, it's just this other thing. But if it's nothing anything else. That's the reason people buy it. James Kemp: There has to be a level of polarity in there. How much James Kemp: is down to the individual, and how much they can consistently do that. Arc: Gotcha. Okay? Arc: Alright. Thank you that. Yeah. II noticed to the the asterisk thing where I put form your ethical call. And I was, no, it's just a cold. Doesn't have to be ethical at all. Can just be a cold. James Kemp: exactly Arc: cool. Thank you. James Kemp: Okay, tame. I think we're done unless anyone's got any more questions. James Kemp: The James Kemp: all your blocks. and deciding what your core is. and putting the offer together, etc., are internal. James Kemp: . I have purposely oversimplified this training. James Kemp: because James Kemp: when when there's no other excuses but the ones that you give yourself James Kemp: fan you're getting closer to being able to do it. James Kemp: And everyone here, everyone who's put it, put an offer together and put it down the marketplace. And there's things to test, the the fear of rejection, and all these pieces. James Kemp: But if you have a core. James Kemp: you put together a promise. James Kemp: you have a clear plan that you take them through, and you include those things. James Kemp: You are stacking the deck in your favor. James Kemp: and that's that's that's the name of the game. James Kemp: James Kemp: I purposely not paying lip service to your internal emotional objections to this. James Kemp: They are going to be there, no matter what. and we can help you get over them. James Kemp: Maybe you could just drink a big glass of concrete and harden the fuck up and go make an offer. But that's just me. James Kemp: Okay, pigs James Kemp: love you. and I'll see you tomorrow.

Customers To Clients How To Generate Customers, Cashflow and Clients Fast The Power Ladder The realities of market dynamics can frustrate or be embraced. Not everybody is going to buy your stuff. In fact, very few will. The key to leverage is identifying who is likely to firstly, buy, then who will make a custom of buying (customer) and who would find further access to you useful (client) What people say and what people do are very different things. Many people in your addressable market can intend to work with you in the future. Hanging on this hope will sustain you for a little then depress you when it’s not fulfilled. Many businesses go crazy and broke trying to ‘educate’ and ‘nurture’ their market when making an offer presents the simplest shortcut. The strongest intent demonstration is the act of purchasing. This gives you a signal to tune into and explore the intent behind that commitment. My Business Model - August 2023 Built on The Sovereign Principles and deploying the correct modality via the correct channel: Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them. ● Consulting - Giving someone the answer. ● Mentorship -Showing someone how I would do it ● Creator - Conjuring of original ideas ● Curator - Assembly of the best ideas If, then: If I share good content on social and make it easy and natural to join my email list I will grow my leads daily If I create great products for clients then customers will purchase them and a few will naturally see that it’s worth joining The Syndicate If I make it easy to get started in The Syndicate with pricing economics I will maximize client experience and LTV naturally by unbundling and having dynamic offers. If I build a great client base and establish great relationships, I will naturally find partners to work with for a very long time Products: Dynamic Products Economics: Dynamic Pricing Dynamic pricing allows the highest flexibility for clients to choose the speed they move at. More access allows more speed. Observations: Adding 1:1 component is the fastest route to raise LTV for those with group programs ● Using pricing economics weekly pricing is the fastest route to increase volume for group programs The Flow: From Customer to Client 1. Create an offer and sell it to your audience 2. Deliver the offer and invite those who purchased it to become clients 3. Profit Creating A Customer Offer A customer offer simply creates a customer via a purchase. The price is not irrelevant but it’s relatively unimportant. The act of purchasing at any dollar value is a trust signal. Ideal Components 1. Training and Templates 2. Live Workshop 3. Call (if looking for volume) Choosing It Guidelines: Solve a single problem, deliver a single result ● Sell them what they want, give them what they need ● Magic pills sell in large numbers ● Repurpose - use something you’ve already created ● Small sum of larger part Behind The Offer Code: Having a great offer that’s easy to sell and easy to buy is essential to businesses <$3m. Knowing this indicates a moderate to high sophistication level. I felt an offer training and templates would be a good lead offer as I opened up The Syndicate as it appeals to people who largely already have offers and would to optimise them. It is also one of the key things we do inside The Syndicate as great offers are the driver of great businesses. It plays to my strengths, has a high ROI potential and I had massive amounts of proof that the contents of the training was proven and effective. Selling It: 40/40/20: 40% - How desirable the offer is to your audience 40% - The scarcity and deadline you place on it 20% - Your messaging and marketing After the offer selection, the primary driver is scarcity and urgency. If you have these present, it will do most of the heavy lifting

. It plays to my strengths, has a high ROI potential and I had massive amounts of proof that the contents of the training was proven and effective. Selling It: 40/40/20: 40% - How desirable the offer is to your audience 40% - The scarcity and deadline you place on it 20% - Your messaging and marketing After the offer selection, the primary driver is scarcity and urgency. If you have these present, it will do most of the heavy lifting. The missing out on the discount or deadline will naturally drive those who are going to purchase to do so. The promo length is ideally 5-10 days. Anything in that range works. The limiting factor is always how much content you can produce to promote the workshop. If you feel you will run out of things to say, run a shorter promo period. Example 7 Day Sequence - Drip Feed Offer Components Day 1-2 - Training and Templates ● Day 3-5 - Add Live Workshop ● Day 6 -7 - Add Call/Deadline approaching Resources: You have a license to replicate these: Email Templates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQLsbMymv4LVF3364wmElrHV4U9Bd0a6HKpOZSAAk Ao/edit?usp=sharing Sales Page: https://www.swipemymarketing.com/welcome Delivery Page: Ungated offer delivery dramatically cuts down on support requests…. Creating A Client Offer Creating It: Everything I know about high converting offers is in The Offer Code: https://www.skool.com/the-syndicate/classroom/49b3b0fa?md=878f3045152b491eb225eb6f386 0e0aa Unbundling and Stacking Thinking of your individual unit economics is a helpful frame to make effortless offers and creativity. Eg $250 unit. Add 2x $250/$500 unit to every second client and you have doubled average LTV. Sell $250 community offer, upgrade client to $500 per week coaching for 10 weeks, client attends $2500 retreat with 12 x $250 pay plan and purchases. Selling Your Client Offer The key metric, has and always will be, offers made. Client Offers see a significantly higher conversion rate when offered to customers than those who haven’t purchased before. Simply, it’s easier to sell something to someone who’s bought before than a person who’s never bought from you. Offer Touch Points: Beginning of live workshop - ‘I’m going to make an offer so here it is..’ ● End of live workshop - ‘Here it is, please send me questions you have privately..’ ● Offer invite sent out with replay ● On call included in Customer Offer
