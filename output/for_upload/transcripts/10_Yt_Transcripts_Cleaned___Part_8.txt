# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 8

that is multiple times of someone :48 who's watched exactly the same content over 12 months y and you need somewhere that allows that total attention time :55 YouTube allows it it allows people to bench on your stuff email does as well because people can you :02 know sort and categorize things and look for them the other social platforms less so because of algorithms and it you can :08 have profiles and those things but it's not natural for people to go and click on someone's profile and read everything necessarily they did and :14 that's why Facebook groups work really well because it allows people to go to one place and consume stuff in a really convenient way yeah so you need a place :20 where you're going to make consistently but I think you also need a place where people can binge binge your stuff and go :26 deep on it before they make the decision because most sales happen before the sale has taken place right y :33 so people are posting they've picked a platform they should be posting consistently I would say every day and :39 whether people say that is that 5 days or seven days the answer is yes right pick one short medium long right so I :46 post on my stories every day sometimes it's absolutely nothing sometimes it's client testimonial sometimes it's linking to a training I post on the news :52 feed when I feel it and then I do right now we're at four YouTube videos a week but that's only one me :58 sitting down and creating a video the other three are recordings of calls and things that so I think whether you :04 just start with one and I think the easiest place to start honestly for most people is a podcast if they just have conversations in personal :10 virtually some people aren't ready to look at a camera and hold people's attention for 10 15 20 minutes on a :17 topic which is fine have conversations with people you find fascinating just make sure that there's a conversation :22 happening and not an interview because then the person that that your audience member is listening is getting to know the other person and still has no idea :28 who you are but I think short medium long on a very practical note I'll share this you can add anything there's :35 four types of content that I've found in terms of main piece of content teach show share give teach what you :41 know share who you are show client results and how how what you do Works give people opportunities to take :48 next steps with you give away assets who wants this comment below post on the stories see me a DM and then regular :55 calls to action that could be weekly in small doses as in if you want to find out more information about this or :01 monthly or cyclical six to eight weeks around cash campaigns doors closing stuff that that's how I see :07 it from a practical perspective anything you want to add on that yeah I've got the three PS which is proof problem and philosophy right so the proof is :15 client results and I to give client results of insight what step I I think testimonials are

[ __ ] :20 personally because I don't people don't pay attention to them and people they're always crafted in a way to manipulate :27 somebody lots of marketing I've got this case study format which says here's Bob and he made 100 Grand and :33 these are the three steps he took to do it and I find that it replicates much better for people to go that could be me :39 and the proof Factor philosophy is who are you what do you believe what's your worldview and those things :45 and occasionally being pretty polarizing in there State what you believe nowadays in the safest possible :51 way maybe not everything you believe but the things that are definitely digestible and then problem which is you :57 know the functional solving of the of the pains that people are in in front of them and giving them assets to do it or or solving a problem with them so :04 let's talk about how to stand out yeah so you're creating content short medium long right stuff that disappears in a :09 Day stuff that has some lasting effect and stuff that people can binge they've got the Frameworks proof :15 philosophy what was the third one problem problem perfect how do people :20 stand out yeah because they can listen to everything we're talking about they're I started the podcast and it's not working I think it's what's :26 really important to to note for anyone who stumbled on this I know cuz this is what it gets into the real Nuance of the :32 person exactly so people who might have stumbled onto this need to know neither of us sell with sales calls yeah so the :39 cheapest thing I sell is 18 Grand I think yours is probably similar and it happens without a sales call and :46 these aren't old leads these aren't people that have followed me for 5 years some of these people 5 days into my world but they done the total attention :53 time they've gone deep and Etc the key that I I'll just mention some of the feedback that I get is to why people :59 work with me is and I never used to get this feedback this is all this year when I really focused in on it so one of :07 the things I I hear a lot is I don't really know why you're standing out :12 I've been really loving your content but I feel there's something different about your energy right and this can :18 come down to silly things we joked earlier a few months ago early this year about me buying chickens and so I'm :25 living here in barley we live a very similar life but I have chickens and you don't that makes us different :30 people to other people's perception a only a certain type of person has :36 chickens you've got a dog but if you had a cat you'd be a certain type of person that if you shared that online it would :42 be a differentiator right if you were the exact same person but you're here was blue if you bleached blue :48 here the perception of who you are would change you could be saying the same things but :54 people perceive you in a different way so one of the mistakes those people make is they try and pretend to be someone :00 they're not so they go oh Dan's got chickens I'm going to buy a chicken and I'm going to post a photo on mine and :05 that's a stupid example of things people do all the time they get the Miami Penthouse they get the Rolex they're :10 having cigars with the boys they're taking whatever it might be they see what someone else is done and they replicate it but the problem is it's :17 what what works is authenticity yeah so talk to us about how people can :22 stand out more not just through being b or smarter but being more of :28 themselves the old topic of being yourself is the infinite the infinite game roide yeah it's Pandora's :34 Box and you're but my my

[ __ ] all leaders :25 in the world and people want something to follow right so and your and your you :31 have you haven't crafted an identity you didn't get the chickens to look good on the internet you got the chickens cuz :38 you animals right and people are I admire Dan because he's doing what he wants to do bro it's killing me :44 I've got one disa chicken that everyone's tell bring with you our new :50 we can't talk about the chickens you've left but no I'm not playing a character on the internet pretends to :55 no it's it's just the're real chickens I've seen them I picked them up but there's the to me it's how :02 do you stand out you be a leader right and for me I did it a different way which is this is what I'm going to :08 do M and then I did it yeah which if you think about it is extremely rare yeah in in the world today I said this :14 is what I'm going to do this is my update against that and this is what this is what I'm doing next and everyone :20 goes that so cool that's amazing I now trust you more than I did before because :27 they're and I said this is what and there were two things on there that I'm not doing and I didn't do and I'm :32 this is why I changed my mind on these things cuz I got I was in the trenches and I did it and I changed my mind on a :38 couple of things that was my way MH and in the in the course of being very :43 transparent about why I did that and you've been very transparent about why :48 you're doing what you're doing and to me that it all comes back to that y why are you doing this yeah because :56 without a reason why people have no resonance with the reason if if your :02 reason why of buying a Miami Penthouse and those things are really strong and valid yeah to you and they're :10 established to you people will follow along with that if your reason why is because the other people did it :16 they won't yeah so exactly the same people can take exactly the same actions but if the reason why is absent in in a :23 true sense then everybody knows it Y and if you treat your audience fools or :28 the treat treat people fools who are watching and going I'm just doing this because everyone else is doing it :35 they don't pay attention it's congruence right that's what we're looking for that always is so sensitive to as human beings finely tuned

[ __ ] detectors :42 yeah well I I so finely tuned I'm in the process of moving doctors right now and so I've been dealing with thyroid :48 stuff and I'm trying to find this guy and I sent I sent him to to a friend and I was do :53 anything about this guy and he's I know almost nothing but the stuff that I've seen I believe you really believes :59 it and I just think he has awesome energy and just intuitively it feels the right move for you and I was :04 that's really interesting and then we went on this rant of talking about energy and picking people's up :10 picking up people's intention and congruence and authenticity and so before anyone thinks that their job now :17 if they're a fitness coach is to post their business plan to Facebook of I'm :23 I'm at 10K a month and I want to get to 30k a month and the people who the single Ms who want to lose weight that the say clientele don't don't care what :30 you're really talking about is also motivation and why and authenticity and congruence because one of the clients :35 that I work with works with people in I can't remember what the language is but it's you're in :41 physical pain but it's neurological right so it's sematic pain relief or something that and he is so :47 passionate about what he does because he helped his mom heal chronic pain through his process and so that's his :53 whole motivation I've had worked with someone else before who was a weight loss coach who helped his mom lose :58 150 pounds and saved your life and so there's that particular piece that I think is really key which is that :04 if you're just showing up as someone on the internet trying to sell something you lose the ability to connect with people to a deep level because people :10 want to know why you're doing what you're doing yeah let's talk about some practicals around tone and :16 personality so you I was showing you my AI bot before the the Dan AI and I'm so :21 excited to roll that to client it's it's hundreds of hours of my it's been trained on hundreds of hours of my :27 content but what it's missing is tone so I'm almost happy with it it :33 says stuff that I wish I would say or I did say once upon a time that I forgot right but it's missing tone and so it :40 doesn't sound me MH one of the things that I found that really interesting when I first started on :46 the online space was LinkedIn especially was this hilarious place where people :52 pretended to be someone they weren't and so you would look at their profile and it was advisor investor five times :57 founder and then you do a sales call do dot dot they're yeah I'm working parttime at a tire shop and you're :04 what's going on that's an extreme example of something that people do is that I find I hang out with some :09 people and I'm surprised at how much I them or vice versa and because the version of who they are :16 online and the version of who they are in real life the real them is there's this huge Connect Now obviously there's :22 levels of people overthinking things imposter syndrome what will people think of me but talk to me about :28 how you think about tone because I think neither of us take each other or ourselves very seriously we're :34 constantly talking crap and not in just a silly way but just it we're not we're not afraid to point fun at :40 ourselves we laugh at each other talk to me about how tone plays into standing out online I think that :49 it all roads lead back to that self-esteem and that comfort thing as well the I'm pretty dry right and :57 I'm right that and I speak that and I am that right your your

of us take each other or ourselves very seriously we're :34 constantly talking crap and not in just a silly way but just it we're not we're not afraid to point fun at :40 ourselves we laugh at each other talk to me about how tone plays into standing out online I think that :49 it all roads lead back to that self-esteem and that comfort thing as well the I'm pretty dry right and :57 I'm right that and I speak that and I am that right your your :03 online content and your personality they're the same thing right my online content and my personality they're :10 pretty much the same thing yeah right so I think it's I hate that authenticity word yeah but I think I :16 think it's turning up as yourself unapologetically and and and speaking the speaking through but speaking the :24 way that you speak yeah because people again have that that :29 desperation to truly see somebody Y and I and it's interesting a client was me :34 messaging me today saying I've got a referral for you and I was okay cool and and she shared a screenshot and :41 it was someone noticing a shift in her and her content and she said I can :47 finally see you and it's so good and I've known you and she's you must be working with James yeah because they :54 they're in the in the same world but it's the ton is I'm finally because I know you I can finally :00 see you and I think we we're desperate as humans we're desperate to connect with people and we're desperate to truly :05 see and not be deceived so when when you truly just turn up in the way that you want to turn up as yeah then that comes :13 through all these different channels that comes through in video that comes through in content that comes through in text yeah and if you turn up as yourself :20 then you can't be you can't be competed with yeah right and I think this is a on :25 on a really practical note it also takes practice so it's how do you find your voice you just speak a lot and :32 write a lot and then over time you figure that out because I think it's with appointment sitting right and :39 I don't really do much of that these days but I respond to messages and one of the things that I find is that people :44 are happy to have a conversation in real life and then it's they fumble the ball in the DMS because they're :50 this person said this but if I say this then what are they going to say well I lose the sale and and it's just overing what do I say to get the sale and I'm :57 be curious about where they are be curious about where they want cuz these people it you working on that it's :05 the best sell by chat script is curiosity of being interested in somebody yeah but but my point here is :11 that people just have to do it so part of what we're saying is that some people are stuck being inauthentic :18 because they're not making the decision to go all in on them yeah and some people are three pieces of content in :23 yeah the answer is a thousand more yeah right to really find your full expression for me I find that I :29 have a sense of humor off stage in my real life and the moment I tried to bring that on stage in the early days I :34 was trying to write jokes the problem was not my type of humor right so now when I'm funny it's always exactly the :42 same as I am in real life which is in the moment yeah right and so it's just through the repetitions and the practice :48 that I think people need to commit to in order to get to that place of as :54 funny as it sounds it takes practice to be yourself it really does and also if :00 people really want it they've got to understand whether the

to write jokes the problem was not my type of humor right so now when I'm funny it's always exactly the :42 same as I am in real life which is in the moment yeah right and so it's just through the repetitions and the practice :48 that I think people need to commit to in order to get to that place of as :54 funny as it sounds it takes practice to be yourself it really does and also if :00 people really want it they've got to understand whether the trade-offs are worth it that I I hear people say a lot :07 I want to have a coaching or Consulting business but I don't want to put myself out there the only :13 alternative path to that is lots of money for ads right so you either use :18 the energy of connection or use the energy of money mhm both of them :23 put you out there both of them put messages that resonate with people that they respond to that come towards you so :29 if you'd rather do the path of doing the Reps and going organic and :35 publishing content then you've got to put yourself out there if you'd rather do the path of getting ads and putting people through funnels and :41 nurturing them and taking the time to do that then you got to put money in yeah there there's there's not a third :47 path yeah so make the choice so let's talk about team so firstly team is to Choose Your Own :53 Adventure and that if you sell via calls yeah versus DMS if you do all the coaching yourself or you get a coach :59 that's a variable right I would say we both agree that you should get a virtual assistant y ASAP y if you don't have an :07 assistant you are an assistant as our friend Tony Fraser Jones once told me yeah right so I think day day one :13 you could find 30 minutes a day of admin to get in a virtual assistant yeah where do the pressure come on the most :19 for people typically when scaling is it is it firstly on the sales side or the :25 coaching side yeah so the two the two gaps come up first are a skills gap which is I've run out of ways :31 I've run out of knowledge or ability to do this so I need to go and find somebody to do it or a time or a time :37 one so that generally when people are at the beginning one or both both of those show :44 up and that that's that's pretty challenging to navigate but the first I I agree with the first h VA but :51 then the next tire should be where is the bottleneck right do you this is :57 the key way to think about it people it's not just oh the second higher as always is this person here's the :02 perfect dog chat the the where is the bottleneck and where is the bottleneck where that you can step out of and you :09 know and solve the bottleneck through the process of a human or Contracting someone so it's the bottleneck at the front with leads and sales sorry is it :16 at the front with with leads is it in the Middle with sales or is it the end with delivery right and then it's :22 do you hire a coach or a conci you've got a couple of choices there do you hire a saleson a closer to do more :29 to do more reps or do you hire someone to get in the DMS run leads run funnels and get leads and :36 convert them into prospects yeah so it's it's a bottleneck analysis as the :41 the first major hire if you because the virtual assistant is relatively easy to find you might go through two or three but the biggest thing I see :49 with virtual assistant is the Rel L inexpensive in the world that we're in and people are I don't have enough :54 work for them to do and you're you said the average virtual assistant :00 30 minutes an hour a day you're paying them to
