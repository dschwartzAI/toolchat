# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 2

> "I've got something cool. I'm doing this. Would it be useful if I shared it with your people?"
 The "what's working now" frame is easy to sell. It's easy to sell to the audience owner and gain insight. You don't need a grand strategy. Showing what's working now is easy to sell, deliver, talk about, and convert. How do you find people with your audience? You need to be in the in-group. Be in communities this. When you've established yourself, you can answer people's questions. It's a natural stepping-off point. Most people don't contribute enough value to their communities. If you don't have people you can ask, you haven't been useful enough. The value of a community is in the value you bring. You can extract value after you've delivered it. ## The Value of Contribution in Communities **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of contributing value to communities before expecting anything in return. He shares his own experience of becoming the most useful member and reaping the rewards. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Most people's mindset in communities is "what do I get?" They close off opportunities. You have to demonstrate before you ask. People are asking, "What's in it for me?" Few give freely, so few get freely. I decided to be the most useful member of any group I joined. The more useful I became, the more I got in return. People think about what they get, not what they give. Those who give the most get the most. How do you identify true fans from a list? By making offers. I'll cover that more next week. Making offers attracts and repels. It's list hygiene. Those who aren't open will leave. They were observers, not fans. ## Refining Offers and Leveraging Paid Advertising **Summary:** James Kemp advises on testing offers organically before running paid ads, especially for new customer offers. He also emphasizes focusing on one offer and getting it right rather than creating too many different offers. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Should you test offers organically before paid ads? Yes, especially for new customer offers. If it's established, go straight to paid traffic with a lead magnet. Look for something people will engage with and buy, warm or cold. Focus on one offer and get it right, rather than creating too many. My content is coaching content. I coach through my content. I relay recent coaching sessions. It's raw and energetic. Is there a process? The key is recency. The most engaged posts followed a moment of insight. Don't hold back. Give it all away. Deliver the same ideas to your audience as to clients, just less personalized. ## Following Up After a Successful Presentation **Summary:** James Kemp suggests running a group call with a call to action for following up with a large number of leads generated from a stage presentation, rather than offering individual calls. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I jumped on stage last week. I gave it all away. I got about 300 contacts. I wanted to give more. Any recommendations for follow-up? If you have 300, I wouldn't offer individual calls. What was their hook? Doubling profits? Run a virtual session with a call to action. 
> "I spoke to you at the conference. Many are interested in doubling profits. I'm running a call next Wednesday to go deeper and offer a limited opportunity."

> "I spoke to you at the conference. Many are interested in doubling profits. I'm running a call next Wednesday to go deeper and offer a limited opportunity."
 If you offer 300 calls, you'll get 100. You need another filter. Make a straight offer, then offer calls later. A group call is more leverage. ## Creating a Public Plan and Sharing Personal Goals **Summary:** James Kemp encourages sharing a public plan with a specific number of people you aim to help, emphasizing the importance of authenticity and meaning. He also advises against using fear of failure as a barrier to sharing personal goals. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I the idea of a public plan. My primary focus is Instagram. Should I create a plan to help X number of women beat menopause weight by the first of the year? I'm going to stop you on the language. It's not "training." It's "going to happen." This frees you to do something meaningful. If it's meaningful to you, people gravitate to it. Don't tell them you're only 29. I'm going to compete again next year. Is it ego-driven to share that? What if I fail? It's relevant because it has meaning to you. We're seeking meaning. Can you bottle that? That's the most profound statement. How many people do you want to help? 50. Why is that not available? Fear. What if I fail? Then you have another story. Practice what you preach. Be brave. ## The Power of Public Proclamations and Embracing Failure **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the power of making public proclamations, using the example of a client who publicly stated a profit goal. He emphasizes that there is no actual failure, only directional progress, and that sharing your journey inspires others. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** He stated he'd be making $125,000 a month profit by December. When he met me, he had an $8,000 profit month. He might miss it. Last month he only made $86,000. But directionally, he's 10x'd his profits. In the process, he's inspired others to state what they want publicly. This makes them move towards it. Think in flywheels. How can we transfer meaning and vision? What we think is impossible becomes available because we make it available. I talked about making $3 million. I couldn't have done it without you. But we make these things private. "What if I fail?" There is no actual failure. Helping one person isn't failure. There's no actual failure. You can't fail. It's an optical illusion. We all need reminding. I do all the time. I need to say these things to remind myself. ## Vulnerability and Conviction in Content and Sales **Summary:** James Kemp encourages vulnerability in content, suggesting that exposing more of yourself creates a force multiplier for engagement. He also highlights the power of conviction in sales, using the example of closing a high-ticket client. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I read so much content where I'm, 
> "Give me a little bit more insight, a little bit more vulnerability."

> "Give me a little bit more insight, a little bit more vulnerability."
 It's the force multiplier. I closed a $2,500/month client in a parking lot. Why? I had so much conviction. I didn't care if they said yes or no. I knew how to solve their problem so well that they would be the failure if they didn't sign up. There's a post in there. I don't post on social anymore, I do Google Ads. I wanted to share something that's working. I've been hitting grand slams lately. I got pissed off and wrote a ridiculous landing page. It's just text. I go off on knowing their problem. "This is what you're thinking, next you do this." It's conversational. I have testimonials at the bottom. People say, "You said it better than I could." That gets me leads. I convert them to a conversation via text. My initial offer is to show them I understand their problem so well that they can't imagine I don't know how to solve it. ## Closing the Gap Between Insight and Action **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of closing the gap between insight and action, suggesting that demonstrating real-time problem-solving resonates with audiences and attracts clients. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** If you're working with clients, close the gap between solving the problem and sharing the insight. If you're demonstrating you're in the trenches, people who want to solve those problems will come to you. The faster you close that loop of solving and sharing, the faster you get resonance and clients. I'm great at selling high-ticket one-on-one services, but I have a mega issue selling mid-ticket. I have high-ticket and low-ticket, nothing in between. When we sell one-on-one, we make a promise to find and solve a problem. When we sell to groups, we prepackage the problem into a promise: "We will solve this problem." When we sell one-on-one, we talk about specific outcomes. When we sell group, we aggregate the outcome: "You will see this." The problem is prepackaged. The more specific, the more they can engage. ## Selling Relief and Prioritizing Tension Removal **Summary:** James Kemp explains that coaching is primarily about selling relief from a problem that causes tension. He advises front-loading offers with a quick diagnosis call to provide immediate relief and build trust. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** When people say, "I want access to you," what are you saying? You're probably stretching the gap to providing relief. Coaching is selling short-term relief. We package a call to solve the problem immediately. The more immediate the relief, the better. 
> "We'll get on a 15-minute call, then you can check in weekly."
 This closes the gap between future relief and relief 24 hours from now. Coaching is selling relief from a problem that causes tension. We prioritize things that remove tension or stress. We can't live in a high state of stress. Coaching is providing relief quickly, then extending that: 
> "Once we've solved that problem, we'll solve the next one."

The promise is short-term, the vision is long-term. ## Being True to Your Fans and Embracing Discernment **Summary:** James Kemp advises against being wishy-washy and trying to please everyone, emphasizing the importance of a tight plan that allows people to easily say yes or no. He also discusses the concept of true fans and their unwavering loyalty. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Where I've been straying is not being true to the true fans. The tighter your plan, the easier it is for people to say yes or no. Most people build their business to please everyone. They're constantly thinking, "What does the market want?" Most people don't know what they want. We are articulating ideals and demonstrating. It's the handholds. "This is interesting, or this is relevant." The reticular activating system, the yellow car thing. Sack yourself. Create raving fans. The true fans are the true fans. a footy team, you don't change teams. Offers and content are invitations to pay attention. The best offers are binary. Easy yes or no. The best content is binary. Popular people have detractors because they're individualistic. You can't scale things you don't care about. The coaching industry talks about scaling volume, not scaling care. ## Distributing Your Plan and Building Trust Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp recommends sharing your plan across all platforms, regardless of whether it's a personal or business profile. He also discusses building trust and relationships through content, emphasizing total attention time and the number of insights consumed. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Should I share my plan from a personal Facebook profile or a business page? As long as you're in it, it doesn't matter. Put your plan everywhere. People can refer back to it. Is there a best content format for building trust? It's hitting the four points and letting them consume. Total attention time. People binge my content before calls. They need to consume a certain amount to get enough insight. A 20-minute YouTube video might have 7,000 words, which is about 30 emails. Both convert, but total consumption time varies. With video, you move people faster because they consume at a higher rate. We're chasing a certain number of insights. 10 insights could come from 10 Facebook posts or one YouTube video. ## Identifying Barriers to Buying and Removing Them Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of identifying barriers to buying and using content to remove those barriers. He emphasizes the value of offer creation and how it can accelerate client acquisition and retention. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** When people buy, what conditions have they met? There are natural barriers to buying. I focus on offer creation. If I help people create an offer before they become clients, I can quickly tweak it to increase their earnings. They've already done the groundwork. They think I'm a genius, but they did the work. I know what moves the needle. Getting an offer beforehand makes them more likely to become and stay a client. We've already created momentum. What do they need to get results? What do you need to give them so they see they can get the result, but are better off with you? If your content proves they're looking at a barrier the wrong way, that's insight. If it shows they have what they need but don't know how to use it, that's insight. Insight removes barriers. ## Simplifying Offers and Embracing a Scarcity Mindset **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for small, easy-to-digest offers with fewer barriers. He criticizes the scarcity mindset of withholding help and suggests aiming to help people, which naturally leads to client acquisition. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I talk about small promises

> "I need to be a marketing expert, handsome, and a millionaire to become a millionaire."
 It's the "I need to lose weight before I join the gym" paradox. If your content removes barriers, client acquisition and value delivery transform. People have a scarcity mindset about helping before they become clients. Aim to help people. They'll cross the thresholds. You can solve a problem for $10 or $100,000. It's about levels of access. I'm running a 5-day challenge. Should I change my messaging to call out the problem? There are a lot of people selling results, not what they're doing. I see high resonance with "I'll coach you," not "I'll get you this." 
> "Do you want accountability? I'll coach you personally daily. Want details?"
 We've gotten away from selling what we're doing. ## Selling Coaching and Personal Accountability **Summary:** James Kemp suggests reframing challenge offers to emphasize personal coaching and group accountability, providing specific examples of how to craft compelling messaging. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Reframe: 
> "I'm looking for 10 guys I can coach personally to lose 10 kilos. We'll do it as a group. We'll lose 10 kilos each, and you get my personal help."
 You're getting both personal coaching and group support. It's a spread of accountability. 
> "I'm looking for people to coach personally to lose 10 kilos. We'll do it as a group of 10 guys. We'll lose 10 kilos each, and you get my personal help. Details. I'm choosing people this week."
 The number one powerlifting coach in the UK coaches for free. He gets stupid results. He has a waiting list because he has discernment. Many are trying to be attractive. "If I attract enough, it will work." The opposite frame: 
> "I'm going to repel those not worthy to work with me."
 ## The Power of Repulsion and Conditional Pricing **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the power of repelling unqualified leads and focusing on those who are a good fit. He also touches on the concept of conditional pricing based on client resources. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** You can do that with price. If they're millionaires, you'll find that out quickly. "It's not just about money, it's about attitude." That makes it harder to access you. I know two coaches with conditional pricing. "Because you have more money, I charge you more." I've never heard, "Because you're an asshole, I charge you more." We try to hide behind layers of stuff. Focus on getting a yes or no. Both are valuable. Maybes create false opportunity. Yes or no are the only answers we tolerate. If they can't say no, we close the doors. Two people joined the Syndicate. Someone said they'd join, but weren't ready. "You'll miss this intake." "Can you hold my spot?" No. I'll open again. People aren't used to this. They stay in the maybe. Until it's done, it's not done. ## Focusing on Committed Participants and Embracing Abundance **Summary:** James Kemp advises focusing on serving ============================================================ # SOURCE FILE: all_transcripts_combined_part_10.txt

- ```txt ## Defining the Sovereign Consultant **Summary:** This chunk defines the concept of a sovereign consultant, emphasizing intentionality in building a mechanism, identity, and operating world to achieve high leverage returns from a small, engaged audience. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The goal is building a million-dollar-per-year solo consultancy with 65 clients or less, working less than two days per week. This is achieved by intentionally building your mechanism, the identity people inhabit when they work with you, and the world you operate in. It's not about massive email lists or social media followers; it's about telling a compelling story to a small group. Intentionality is key to achieving high leverage returns from small audiences. You don't need huge lists, attention, or experience if you're intentional about these three categories. ## Client Acquisition Phases and Demonstrating Competence **Summary:** This chunk outlines the phases of client acquisition (lead, customer, client) and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating competence at each stage to efficiently gain clients and minimize sales pressure. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** This model is alpha-driven. A lead is someone you have the right to communicate with, a customer has transacted with you, and a client receives your dedicated time and resources. To obtain a client efficiently, demonstrate competence at each stage. While people can skip steps, a methodical sequence produces the best clients with the least sales pressure. Understanding intent and desire is crucial, and initiating a transaction is the fastest way to gauge intention. An offer-driven model provides a clear next step for prospects. ## The Client World Structure: Community and Consulting Levels **Summary:** This chunk details the tiered structure of the client world, including community and consulting levels, and explains how a seven-figure run rate can be achieved with just these two tiers. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The client world consists of a community level, a consulting level, and optionally, a mentorship level. The mentorship level isn't necessary for a seven-figure run rate. The community level provides a broad base, while the consulting level offers more intimate, high-access service. A menu of offerings allows for varied sales and delivery. For example, a sovereign community might cost $100 monthly with a $3,000 annual option, alongside other higher-priced group programs and consulting hours at a premium rate. ## Core Reasons People Buy Help and Focusing on One **Summary:** This chunk identifies the four core reasons people buy help (make more money, save money, stay legal, live a better life) and stresses the importance of focusing on just one core reason for business clarity and effective messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** There are four core reasons people buy help: make more money, save money, stay legal, and live a better life. Focus on solving for only one core reason; all other benefits are secondary. Focusing on a single core helps refine messaging, offers, and target audience, leading to greater clarity and effectiveness. While secondary benefits can attract and retain clients, a clear core problem is essential. Losing sight of this core can lead to confused messaging and a diluted brand identity. ## Understanding the Client's Problem and Solution **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of understanding how the core problem manifests in clients' lives, their awareness of it, and their current solutions to effectively tailor your unique solution and messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Understanding your core offering is crucial. Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing
