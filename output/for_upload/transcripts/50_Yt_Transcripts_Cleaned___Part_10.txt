# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 10

.com slm Mastermind and Gunning for the $150mil business I think there's more people that need to admit that to themselves that that's all they really want I've heard you allude that to that the past you talk to clients and they're they're embarrassed about their real income goals because they feel it's too small yeah yeah tell us about that how did you were you gunning for 10 you are gunning for 10 million year now but with very very small constraints on that but were you gunning for the the big $150 million business and all the employees and that eventually and how did that fall apart and and eventually reconstruct into your current goals I didn't know what I was gunning for I was gunning for something that that that gave me meaning and and got me recognition and brushed the chip on my shoulder that I've of the small boy who was never seen so I was chasing I was chasing goals because it because number on numbers on the scoreboard for a long time correlated some sense of meaning for me and then in in the time I I was married and I and I built a family and then when that came along it shifted the sense of meaning so at at at at the peak if you of a traditional model I had a team of 14 and we we were doing just under three million year at okay margins and built up the traditional model but it was all consuming and the next up level of skill acquisition of management of hiring of people development I realized would take me away from my call which was having fun and making cool with cool people so the the the game was on and I've and I've got a big skill base to go wherever I want to go with those skills and I've had teams of 25 people and you know in the middle of nine figure businesses so the game was on to to keep growing and keep scaling until life made me realized that there was life going on that was outside the computer screen and outside the the the the 9 to8 hours and there were skills I didn't want to didn't want to develop was it having kids that made you realize that yeah yeah and yeah you said that there skills I didn't want to Honing skillset and mindset develop did you have any one in your circle that you feel frowned upon you or tried to convince you to go to the next level or was there their respect for knowing what you wanted I still do I think there's I the choices I've made especially in the last 24 months a lot of my friends have large businesses a lot of my friends have large teams and a lot of my friends have secret struggles that they don't want to share with people because they they they sell that model and privately they say to me they're jealous but they also I'm not I'm not looking to invalidate anybody's idea of what a business is and or or what life is I'm just saying there's a choice about how we build it and we have to be deliberate to to decide the the things that are important to us when I started working with you I allow places to put truth on the table what do you want because we're all in these we're all in these environments where a lot of people are trying to self validate the thing that everybody else wants and they're it's that Spider-Man meme of do you you want this he you want this and everyone's pointing at each other going yeah you want this big agency with this huge team and you want the those things and then everybody's quietly turning around whispering and going this sucks the responsibility the expectations the margins the work the chase this sucks there must be a better way and I give permission Miss for people not to build businesses because very very few people want a business and all the things that are associated with it and until you've been inside these big machines where you can lose yourself you don't really appreciate what that means and a lot of people say they're building a business but what they want is enough cash flow to live a

quietly turning around whispering and going this sucks the responsibility the expectations the margins the work the chase this sucks there must be a better way and I give permission Miss for people not to build businesses because very very few people want a business and all the things that are associated with it and until you've been inside these big machines where you can lose yourself you don't really appreciate what that means and a lot of people say they're building a business but what they want is enough cash flow to live a great life and spend time with the people that are important to them and do the things they want to do whatever that may be and if we break down all the things of my model and my philosophy and those things it's that what do you want here's some tools that I've got that can help you get there and I have clients with sales teams I have clients with Setters and closers I have clients who deliver agency services and have done for you and I don't judge a single piece of that I just give them a leverage to ensure that they're doing the things that they want to be doing with the people they want to be doing it with and rewarded adequately for that The Art of Time Management yeah so much there would you say the you work quote unquote work two days a week meaning Cent work two days a week I work a lot including in my head yeah yeah you work in your head yeah on the other other times but you are talking to clients two days a week would you say that the time talking with the clients as a necessary part of hey I'm selling Consulting so this has to happen at some point or and or does that feel the art to you and what parts of what you do do you enjoy the most all of it because I see business as a creative game with a scoreboard right this thing we call business and the most effective long- lasting businesses institutions movements Etc are are rooted in ritual and creativity and and and freshness and newness of old things you know whether it's politics or religion or business it it all or art it all manifests in the same way so my goal with clients is to give them the tools that I've accumulated give them the insight about how they worked for me and then help them understand how they might work for them so they can go off and run at themselves and we can both learn something because they're not learning something from an application of and the delivery of a client then it's not interesting to me so I am infinitely curious rather than trying to gatekeep anything I'll use you as an example if I may yeah I'm not on YouTube I don't know much about YouTube in terms of an organic strategy I've seen it I've worked with people who have giant YouTube channels I work with people who spent $55 million a month on YouTube ads I've seen it all but I don't participate in it so I'm infinitely curious about when I help you build a community and start to build some coaching and Consulting offers in these pieces how you apply those to your world because if I can see the insights and they bring them into my world that makes me better and the the increase in my skill and the deployment of that skill and the more I'm prepared to let it go then makes you better and we're in a happy cycle so I don't see any of it as work I just see it as art and then the science bit the art is the creativity and the deployment of it and letting go of the ideas and that's been a that's been a two decade long mantra for me of just letting go of ideas giving them to people so we can multiply them they can multiply them and faith in the and trust in whoever you believe in on that spiritual level that the universe will will return that favor and and work in all our favores so I'm always looking for what ideas can I give people and put out there and then how can they how can they develop ideas because it if it makes if you do well with my ideas I do well from

been a two decade long mantra for me of just letting go of ideas giving them to people so we can multiply them they can multiply them and faith in the and trust in whoever you believe in on that spiritual level that the universe will will return that favor and and work in all our favores so I'm always looking for what ideas can I give people and put out there and then how can they how can they develop ideas because it if it makes if you do well with my ideas I do well from the insights that you gain from those and we all do well together yeah what a worldview wake up in the morning and it's not about how can I pad the bank account it's about how can I share and multiply ideas with cool people that I hang out with would is that a fair characterization definitely definitely and and it's from obviously it's from a place of to break the seal on that you have to trust that the Universe has you back but now it's from a place of deep Financial Comfort strong stability financially and mentally so it's easy for me to say these things but it it it it had to start from a place of if I let let my ideas go and put them out there then I be rewarded and the less expectation I had around that and the less pressure and need I had for that it's funny that the more I was rewarded for that over the long term in the in the financial scoreboard that that that does matter but can also be blinding when you're trying to manipulate it in the short term lots of people are chasing short-term results where if they allowed those results to happen then their long-term results would be would be infinitely better than they seemen to today tomorrow yeah it's so Measuring a different success interesting so sorry this is a bit of an inflection point but it just to relate back to what we're saying and then transition to the next point I read this in one of your posts recently as well as a mentoring coach I'd love to hand over the exact stepbystep template to success it doesn't exist we all measure success differently I assembled mine your path can be assembled too that's the the lie that's being sold is the opposite of that that you need to want the lambo you need to want the big house and the the refreshing breath of air air from you and others you is that that hey let's just figure it out it may be something different than you're being told it's useful to get the things I hate shs so let's talk in utility it's ful to get the things to to then validate or invalidate the idea of how how important those things are right yeah when I bought $153,000 SUV that I'd coveted and watched the YouTube reviews of and watched people drive and had the wonderful engine sound I did it so four months later I could prove to myself that that didn't make me any happier and it introduced a level of stress in my life that was was not pressure and was unwelcome right I bought the super expensive watch to wear it around to be then too scared to wear it in public because it it's too expensive and it's too valuable and I might scratch it so now it sits in a box in the safe yeah right so it is useful to chase things to to then prove or disprove whether those things give you any validation or meaning or or what they mean because some of them do there are certain things that you can give and get that that that enrich your life in ways that you didn't didn't appreciate I I live in a pretty oversized large Villa in in B right and I always said I don't need something that big and that fancy it's excessive it's too much we've got space in this office I'm in the corner of and I there's just the this massive room in front of me because I've got all the space right and then when I started inviting people over and I bought clients over and we sat down and I and I and I built an environment where I saw people have

appreciate I I live in a pretty oversized large Villa in in B right and I always said I don't need something that big and that fancy it's excessive it's too much we've got space in this office I'm in the corner of and I there's just the this massive room in front of me because I've got all the space right and then when I started inviting people over and I bought clients over and we sat down and I and I and I built an environment where I saw people have breakthroughs that they'd never had had in any other ways and then I'm expanding my family now a puppies puppies included it to to to enrich this space but for a long time I said I didn't need it I didn't want it and all kinds of levels of cope depending on what attitude I had on the particular day so getting things is useful to prove or disprove whether those things enrich your life because you may be surprised when you hit certain goals or get certain things in your life what they lead to and what they mean to got it it reminds me of another one of your posts where you maybe you can provide some more context on this but you were talking about how hilar how hilarious it is to see these 20s something in monk mode just head down doing nothing not spending any of their money and you're it's going to manifest itself as this crazy midlife crisis at 50 you might as well buy the lambo now dude figure out you don't want it either way it's going to be fun to watch but their C and hooker era is going to be epic because it's it's just bottling up energy and saying that you can Channel it in one way and that will get you to the goal what and there's enough truth in that for certain number of people for it not to be disproven but for many people these these ideas are inherently bottling up energy that could be used in in much more productive ways yeah so would you say the wanting of the material item there's some people who would say don't let that drive you you have to find your why etc etc but you and I both know that why can be more elusive than we want it to be sometimes yeah what would you those are temporary goal posts that you're okay with being I'm doing this right now to get the next material thing and then that will teach me a little bit more about what I don't want and what I do want yeah do stuff get rich and then see how you feel right yeah and this is the same philosophy with with any any growth I knocked on hundreds of doors every day when I was doing door-to-door selling right because behind each door was a the opportunity for the sale right yeah and life is exactly the same life is exactly the same do things work out what those things mean to you and then either do more of them or stop doing them right and that's an oversimplification of a a very simple philosophy but I just believe life is simple do stuff see how it makes you feel what results did you get and then stop it or do more of it and I think especially in societies where there's a lot of high IQ people or and a lot of people professing emotional intelligence a lot of people just get stuck in their head about what success might look and then they abstract that by looking at how someone else does it or I don't want to Lambo because I saw a guy who's got a Lambo and he's an right I don't want to move to B because I saw someone go there and they they got a sore tummy right so they we approximate someone else's experience with ours so it stops people doing stuff and this is the this is the amazing Paradox I see nowadays it's never been easier to start something and it's never been easier to to get rich by just from your ideas yet less and less people are starting because they're worried about what the future might look if they do those things because they're living through other people because

move to B because I saw someone go there and they they got a sore tummy right so they we approximate someone else's experience with ours so it stops people doing stuff and this is the this is the amazing Paradox I see nowadays it's never been easier to start something and it's never been easier to to get rich by just from your ideas yet less and less people are starting because they're worried about what the future might look if they do those things because they're living through other people because they've got that shoved in their face through social media every single day and they go well if I do that then this is going to happen it's you don't know just do stuff yeah do more stuff make more offers take more risks do more things while you can and then learn we only learn by doing yeah such a good point so you listed that you wanted today Who do you need to be, to be successful? to talk about who do you need to be successful who sorry who do you need to be to be successful online I glad I reread it because I was thinking it's what do you need to do to be successful online but that differentiation of who do you need to be is is huge and I want to give you plenty of time to talk about it but I want to ask this question first what would you say in terms of Financial Security what were the levels for you where different levels of abundance or just being able to breathe and look around and focus on this becoming mind frame when did that unlock for you obviously it would be amazing if everyone could unlock that earlier and I think they'd ironically progress faster if they could do it out of abundance instead of out of need but yeah talk about your own Journey there and then let's dive into the the journeys of what other people might look yeah I think each step of the journey if I reflect back whether it was from job to entrepreneurship back to job back to entrepreneurship was finding replacement value as I call it so I work with a lot of people who are have the Golden Hand s they're coming out of a particular place where they're making good money but they feel trapped in it so we work on replacing that level of income with an income that they love doing and a much higher effective value rate because they have multiples of Leverage so rather than earning 150 Grand a year as a as a as a VP you're earning 150 Grand a year as a consultant and you're working 85% less right so for me it was the the the levels of abundance were matching the income of the previous thing of the previous step but getting more time back and that allowed me to be them more creative to take the next step and a lot of people chase the income increase rather than chase the time increase and the times where all the magic happens the times where all the creativity the unique uness the development the building happens but people are focused on the work because they directly correlate the work with getting the income right yeah so for for me I was coming from what was I on when I left grb one about 160 Grand basic plus bits and pieces so say it was 200k by the end of the year right I had to walk in to Consulting gigs that paid me at least that but I could get those Consulting gigs and I could do them in a day and a half a week so I went from a 60h hour a week marketing director with all the responsibility in the world because it was a 247 operation daily deals was that it is that into a into a place where I could do that and then I could have the time to build it and so in the in the each step up as long as the lifestyle didn't expand and it did to to fill the void of of of surplus in the income then I was always just looking for how can I get more time back how can I get more time back but yeah for the vast majority of people they are comfortable right where they are now at that 10,000 is a month

is that into a into a place where I could do that and then I could have the time to build it and so in the in the each step up as long as the lifestyle didn't expand and it did to to fill the void of of of surplus in the income then I was always just looking for how can I get more time back how can I get more time back but yeah for the vast majority of people they are comfortable right where they are now at that 10,000 is a month is the is the comfort is the comfort level and then the desire kicks in because then there's then it's all about the individual being perpetually dissatisfied and the I'll I'll tell you where I sit now I'm on a run rate of 3 million just over 3 million a year right I haven't had a full year where I've done three million but I'm ahead of that run rate and by the end of the financial year I would have yielded over 3 million out of this this current business at 90 plus% profit margins yeah my reach to 10 million is not through need I have Financial abundance I have vehicles where I investing that money and where it's going and I know the purpose of it it's to play the game more and to stretch the scoreboard so as I said here now I don't need more than that but I desire it because I want to work out how to do it under the constraints that I've got and I can clearly see the path to about five and a half million with the current product Suite what I do now with very little alteration and just optimization I can't see the path but candid I can't see the path beyond that the the the technology the The Leverage and those things will come to me and I have no I have no timeline and I have no goal on that so for me it's always been about replacement putting the time and getting the time back and then then understanding where that time goes to to to then take the stretch and go yeah what's next where where do I really want to go and honestly especially there was a four-month period this year we're seven months into the year there's a four-month period this year where the season was Cruise right just Cruise growth pushing scaling it was not just wasn't feeling it and that's a privilege to be at when you've got hundreds of thousands of dollars coming in every month but it's also paying attention to what season you're in yeah oh just Feeling left behind the it goes back to the worldview of I'm just here finding and multiplying ideas and when I wake up one day and I'm not feeling the growth or whatever I just because your model is very much dependent on you because you have very little team members the business has to grow with you comma and that's okay it has to grow when you're feeling good and it has to cruise when you're feeling cruising is there ever still that sense of I'm I'm getting behind does that creep in or do you have you learned to stve that off oh yeah okay and the more you fill your world with super smart clients and super smart friends the more you'll you'll you'll feel I'm missing something here I feel behind the curve on YouTube I feel behind the curve on AI I feel behind the curve and then I just tap up smart people and go what am I missing here what can I see what what can that I can't see and what do you what do you think I should be doing and just be I don't know what I'm talking about so I've got an idea and I know how these principles apply and I I work from principles but how does how does that layer over so yeah I always feel behind and I always feel feel a certain level of dissatisfied but then I check in with myself on the daily on a on a daily basis about what I'm doing who I'm doing it with and and why I'm doing it to ensure that I'm in the driver's seat of my life
