# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 12

life and a and a and a human world is about expectations and if you don't if you if you coach someone to do something but you're telling them what they want and what to do and you think you're coaching them but you're Consulting to them you're setting an expectation that this thing is going to be right for them rather than allowing to discover it themselves and that will Downstream have an effect on their application of that piece their their their results from it and ultimately their desire to continue it a lot of people have told a lot of people to do things in the in the hope that it was in their best interests that turned out to be damaging and if you correct if you set their correct expectations with people and yourself then everybody is clean and clear going forward and there's no overhang into areas that that can then then blow back to blow back in either party's lives got it it's I think a big theme of you in general is self-confrontation and self- honesty you lie to yourself you'll lie to your clients you'll lie to everyone around you and there's you're always going to be living with that cognitive dissonance until you have to face the music one day and realize that it's been you the bowling ball crashing down everything in its way yeah that that's that's the benefit that I have of being old right I'm a I'm an old man in a young man's game in sense of that that I can I can see what's coming because I've been there and and those pieces and I and I provide a huge amount of value to people in my world because of that because I I can see Over the Horizon because I've already I've already stepped over there and there will be monsters and I can tell you not to go for that one but maybe we can guide you towards this one which might be preferable so how does somebody get to the point of being able to solve the the energy problems the what I have in my mind is the agency owner that's saying make give me little money I give you big money but there's a big asteris there which is you have to work 10 more hours a week to get this next level of money and once the client realizes that they quickly cancel because they don't want to sift through all the the bad leads etc etc yeah they didn't realize all this stuff came with it can you speak to that how do I how do I become the person that can consult the orthodontist on the retirement strategy and that whole thing which feels playing in Disneyland compared to 10 of these Facebook leads never answered the phone and I'm canceling right now which does not feel anything Disneyland to most agency owners and and part of the reason that they're getting burned out yeah yeah so I I'm going to I'm going to default to the Strategic answer for this but one of the major things that I help and nudge and encourage and occasionally force people to do is sell a sell a future ID entity it's very difficult for people to do things if they can't see what they lead to right yeah and it's it's very difficult to for to ask people to change in terms of behaviorally unless they can have a some sense of who they change into who they ultimately become and in the agency world there's a lot of talk about what you can do for people but there's very little talk about what that adds and what that brings to them in terms of at that that life level and that's just about abstracting and understanding that if you're an orthodontist who you know in this initial period if you're work an extra 10 hours a week in the future you'll get 20 hours a week back :04 to play golf that's a different conversation right it's putting the truth on the table and saying as you'll :10 agree Mr business owner this requires investment we we require investment of time we require investment of money but :17 you'll get this back in multiples down the track because we

and understanding that if you're an orthodontist who you know in this initial period if you're work an extra 10 hours a week in the future you'll get 20 hours a week back :04 to play golf that's a different conversation right it's putting the truth on the table and saying as you'll :10 agree Mr business owner this requires investment we we require investment of time we require investment of money but :17 you'll get this back in multiples down the track because we Elevate you from operator to chairman in the business and :24 he's going ah I'm an operator right now I'd love to be a chairman but I need to invest something in the way so it is :31 getting the truth on the table and saying these are the things that you want these are the this is the price we :37 have to pay to some degree in the short term but this is the payoff because when you become the the the the orthodontist :45 chairman then then they start to go yeah I'm just chairman of the board and I'm playing golf and you :52 know I'm not I'm not there in there day today pushing the buttons and chasing the payments and and those pieces so the :58 identity layer in in marketing if you and in terms of positioning is :05 one that's often neglected because we focus on the functional things that :10 people do in the short term but when you start introducing that future identity piece about selling people on and you :16 know indicating who they become not only do you convert more people in the front end because you're taking away the risk :23 of change but you also get better buying in the application of that delivery because everybody's agreed that there's :29 a bigger payoff at the end because everybody's up leveled in the process of doing it got it so it's about figuring :36 out what that vision is so that you can paint it for your client it's not figuring out is giving it to them :43 because the brutal truth is most people LA Vision for themselves and for their lives but if you can paint a picture :48 that's desirable to them at least put lead them toward the promised land and and and they understand it and :55 what the alod dontist might find that he starts playing golf but he's better off that he loved :00 volunteering at the dog shelter but you gave him the space and the time to do that but via a mutual :06 investment and you both and you both committed to play the game so so giving them a future identity is about :12 spelling that out about what they become and who they become and then allowing that allowing that to unfold and :18 allowing them to discover it I have a concept called The Sovereign consultant I have that's a I'm :24 selling people on being a sovereign consultant who makes a million dollars profit a year in two days a week with :31 65 clients or less right what when you get there how you do it what you want to enjoy in the teams if you :37 want to work three days a week go for it but at least we got to it at least we agreed on the on the on the endpoint and :45 and we both understand that the map is in the terrain and the system I give people is is a coloring book :51 that you buy I give you guidelines and boundaries and don't color outside that line but the Stop Needing, Start Attracting :59 colors you put in in in between are completely up to you yeah and final sorry with with help :08 of course and guidance yeah yeah of course final question there how do you put :14 in your Outreach or your content I'm thinking of someone :20 who messaged me last week hey Katen if I if I could add $50,000 a month to what :28 you're doing if it's $50,000 a month in your business and in the next 60 :35 days my my immediate thought and I

between are completely up to you yeah and final sorry with with help :08 of course and guidance yeah yeah of course final question there how do you put :14 in your Outreach or your content I'm thinking of someone :20 who messaged me last week hey Katen if I if I could add $50,000 a month to what :28 you're doing if it's $50,000 a month in your business and in the next 60 :35 days my my immediate thought and I would consider myself maybe someone who's dealing with higher level issues :42 at this point my immediate thought is that sounds exhausting whatever it is you're pitching I don't really want :47 it because I don't need it and I think it goes back to what you're saying the more the more you :54 don't need the money the more money will come to you but that's the same the :01 the clients that people really want are the people that don't that aren't desperate for the extra 10K or the extra 50k :08 they're desperate for some need inside them how do :14 you what's your advice to someone just a an easy way to start implementing :21 that in their Outreach or their content or their ads Outreach is a is an interesting inter one because most :26 people their goal is to drive a conversation to do some convincing and some :32 showing so if I was to do cold Outreach and if you ever catch me doing cold :37 Outreach come over here and do something terrible to me but if you ever if I ever did cold Outreach I would :46 be sending it to someone who I believed would be the ideal person that I could :52 deliver a result for that I'd already delivered so if I was demonstrating to :57 you that I could give you $50,000 extra a month and get you 15 hours a week back :04 I would send you a demonstration of that I would send you a demonstration of this is :09 Bob he's an orthodontist and we got him an extra $50,000 a month while cutting his :16 working hours of this and I would demonstrate Bob on a camera that was :21 chilled and having a natural conversation about telling his experience and doing it rather than :27 saying I can do this for you and the the framers that a lot of people try to be :33 is the hero of someone's Journey but if you're if you make them :39 if you make your clients the hero and you the guide It's funny how your your the quality of what you do and who you :45 work with goes up dramatically because you've allowed people their own power :50 and you've allowed them to tell their story and then you're just inviting more people to obtain that power and :57 tell that story so so much of the Outreach I get is just terrible because :02 someone wants to tell me something that they don't know if I don't if I know it or not already I get all ones all the :10 time would you to make would you get to 20K a month and I'm I would have had to screw up a lot of stuff :15 right now to get to 20K a month I'd be going really far backwards but :21 that's what cold Outreach has become but a lot more I think a lot more demonstrating a lot more :28 showing and a lot less telling and a lot more force would get people a heck of a :34 lot further with greater people that are going to propel them ah heck of a lot further than they think they're even :40 capable of now yeah the word demonstration is what was coming to mind as you were Don't Sell, "Demonstrate" :47 discussing all of that demonstrating your content demonstrate in your ads demonstrate in your Outreach and you :52 don't have to sell it's just not I I'm not the first person to say this :58 but changing your your content from how

:34 lot further with greater people that are going to propel them ah heck of a lot further than they think they're even :40 capable of now yeah the word demonstration is what was coming to mind as you were Don't Sell, "Demonstrate" :47 discussing all of that demonstrating your content demonstrate in your ads demonstrate in your Outreach and you :52 don't have to sell it's just not I I'm not the first person to say this :58 but changing your your content from how how to to how I yeah or how Bob or how :06 Keaton or how Rob did this yeah will have a unbelievably profound effect for :13 a small change and the response that you get to that :18 communication yeah and those stories are it goes back to Sam ens :24 interviews back in the day those those were more valuable than the salonin course because I just got I was :31 oh they did this tiny thing at this moment and that I'm in that exact moment right now and the course was :37 helpful too but the the Epiphany Bridge even though it's not an epiphany Bridge :42 the epiphanies that come from the conversations and the the case studies are infinitely more powerful than just :50 the principles sometimes yeah yeah the :56 I would humbly say that people learn more from modeling me than what I teach :02 them yeah yeah you and anybody who's a parent will understand this :09 very either directly or instinctually that you are what you do and what you :16 are in front of your children much more than what you say to them get off that phone as you spend six hours on your :23 iPhone doesn't work yeah get off your phone when you're not on your phone and they can they can :31 observe that is is is the way to get that behavior in and it's the same with :38 clients treat them children is that the message okay sure let's go with :44 that it makes yeah it makes me think of multiple times in your community this year I'm I'm just excited to see :50 where he takes this I'm going to learn I'm going to learn by the start stuff he starts implementing the stuff :55 he stops implementing how he switches this around I can get on the calls I can go through the course and the workshops :01 but yeah the demonstration is oh that's cool I didn't think of that and :07 it sticks too it sticks more than the conversations we've had yeah :12 yeah I I just ran an experiment over the last three weeks in terms of an offer and next week I'll be :17 breaking that down about what really happened and what it what it looks and then there's still the :24 unknown piece about what that in an offer driven model what you want is for that offer to lead organically :31 and naturally to the next offer and so far that offer from the first offer to the second offer converts a 50% :38 and that's a big breakthrough right getting people to give you $300 and :44 50% of them giving you 3,000 within three weeks after that is a significant breakthrough but on the :50 surface people can copy the $300 and plenty of people have but the next level :56 is or how did that work and what happened behind behind the scenes and and what is the what are the :01 subjective things in that what people came through it and what are they doing and what are the problems and and what what they're learning so yeah the :08 model the modeling has multiple layers as well in terms of because a lot of people delude themselves that they have :14 perfect information they see that person doing that and they're going to funnel hack them and do that but they don't The 0-$100k Way :20 understand the outcomes Downstream and so modeling modeling is multi-stage and also has a lot of depth :25 to it as well okay I know you need to

problems and and what what they're learning so yeah the :08 model the modeling has multiple layers as well in terms of because a lot of people delude themselves that they have :14 perfect information they see that person doing that and they're going to funnel hack them and do that but they don't The 0-$100k Way :20 understand the outcomes Downstream and so modeling modeling is multi-stage and also has a lot of depth :25 to it as well okay I know you need to take the puppy to the beach so I'll I'll close with this question it's a big day :33 yeah big day expectations you alluded to this earlier that's it's the downfall of this :42 space because it's not about it's not about that the :47 results weren't good it's just that somebody was expecting something different most times because you told :53 that to them or you implied it through a maybe a testimonial or some other kind :59 of marketing that you're talking about however you still have this big Vision :05 you give your clients and that's the ideal that everyone's striving towards how is that different from go go from 0 :14 to 100K in X time frame and why do you do it that way the purple book got a :22 lot of people to escalate offers h to make big promises :28 and repeatedly over and over and over a decade of doing this thing :35 I found small promises with big vision would out sell and out deliver :43 and overd deliver on expectations much more than anything and so the the if you work hard on the big :51 Vision about what happens and what they become and you paint a Viv picture of the future then you're only saying that the small :57 promise that you're going to make is the first step on that Journey right and then together you'll work out :03 the terrain so for a lot of people for most people this is much more effective :10 than big promises because big promises are are just by definition harder to keep and there's more variables in them :16 but small promises are easier to deliver on easier to start and and and I found :23 easier to sell as well because if you use an example if you go :29 to since we're talking about orthodontist why not if you go to an orthodontic clinic that's getting you :36 know two leads a month and you say that I can get you 40 booked qualified appointments every single month :42 on autopilot without touching a single thing that experience doesn't feel close :49 to what they're doing now it feels it comes with a lot of baggage and a lot of stretch and lot more work and a lot :56 more stress right M but if you say you're at two Unbound leads two Unbound :02 leads a month and I'm going to get you to four that feels a positive First Step yeah and then ultimately :09 we're we're moving towards a state where you're doing you're getting this many inbound leads but you're only working :14 this time and then we can start to introduce different currencies so it's about understanding that a small promise :19 is easy to keep and easy to sell at the beginning and easy to deliver but it it's a small promise on a step into it L :25 of vision and what's your small promise I'll get you an offer that you can sell :30 with your thumbs on on a Google doc and if we if we do it to one person we can we can do it with a 100 got it and :37 then the big vision is the two hours or two days a week million dollars a year what does that mean to you where do you :43 want to go with it Etc let's let's get some results together first let's let's put an offer together that :49 you can sell in ways that that are effortless to you compared to maybe what you've and how you've done it :54

do it to one person we can we can do it with a 100 got it and :37 then the big vision is the two hours or two days a week million dollars a year what does that mean to you where do you :43 want to go with it Etc let's let's get some results together first let's let's put an offer together that :49 you can sell in ways that that are effortless to you compared to maybe what you've and how you've done it :54 before if we get one if we get one is their belief that we can get two 10 and :00 and 100 yeah it's your your weekly pricing thing which is just lower the :06 now number instead of a th a month it's 250 a week so people can get in but it's the same with believability lower :13 than now believability do you think we could have an offer that you're ready to sell next week yeah that's believable :20 it's what I want versus Pie in the Sky guarantee 100K a month in two :27 months and nobody hits it because they didn't do the 12 things every single day on the :35 guarantee the title is old as time do you yeah do you get people asking :41 because I struggled with this when I I defined the big Vision which for me was it was 200k a year :48 you're working 20 hours a week on your agency and you're taking home 200k :53 a year and I would get a lot of people being well who how many people have :59 done that and is that something how do you do it what's :04 the model they're they're so they get fixated on this Vision as if :09 it's the gospel truth when really it's just look if it's 150 for you not :15 200 that's fine do you get that thing and and if so what do you say to it I I don't I don't get it at all but I :22 have a I have a distinct advantage that I am my own case :29 study so if I put my own mask on First and do fun things with fun people and :34 make lots of money I just say to people do you want something this or your :40 version of it and they go okay and if you don't have that Advantage which is :46 extremely meta do what you teach and teach what you do then you only need one example I've I've seen :55 plenty of cases where someone's just got one ideal case study that they leverage :00 to get a hundred more of those people as the ideal case study so the magical number in these in the in the course of :06 demonstration is usually one right because one leads to two yeah and if you :11 can demonstrate that you can that you can do it once and you can demonstrate :17 you understand the principle success in that and the Strategic level of mechanisms and the vision level of of :25 identity that you that you paint a picture of then you will have more results and more case studies than you :31 can shake a stick out but it it all started with one and I've :37 got rich by getting other people Rich right yeah it's it's it's and the more I :44 I work to that ideal and and then layer enjoyment over the top of it then the :50 better it all works for everybody very cool okay okay so you have a book More of James's Secret :56 tell everybody where they can find the book and then we'll end this thing The Sovereign consultant
