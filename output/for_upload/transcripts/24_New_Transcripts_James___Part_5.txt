# New Transcripts James - Part 5

. James Kemp: Every time something happens they're just on this James Kemp: fucking emotional our client left. Oh, my God, I'm useless. James Kemp: What my mom said when I was 5 was right. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Oh, my God! And then, Shut down for 2 days James Kemp: there is. James Kemp: We are not our office, we are not, we are not James Kemp: yesterday's results. We are not our revenue. We are not our money in the bank, skills James Kemp: skills do do not have the decay that many short-term things in society have skills. James Kemp: Skills are the most durable thing that humans have. James Kemp: and I'm talking to. I'm coaching a few people now who are. James Kemp:, reach the heights of James Kemp: multiple $100,000 month, etc. James Kemp: And aren't there at the moment. But they've still got the social persona, and they're still posting on Facebook this. And those things. And they feel horrendous imposters in it. James Kemp: right? James Kemp: And so that's a challenge, because I'm taking them back to put to tell them that the skills are durable. James Kemp: I played paddle on the weekend for the 1st time. Everyone plays paddle here. There's fucking courts everywhere, right? I played tennis to a rep level up to about 17, James Kemp: and so I was good, and I haven't picked up a racket that James Kemp: resemble the tennis racket in 20 years. James Kemp: and I picked it up, and 5 min later I was smashing all over the place. It hadn't gone away. James Kemp: Skills are extremely durable. James Kemp: But James Kemp: we get very, very caught up in the short term results, or the perceived social impact of those things. James Kemp: but and that the counterintuitive pieces to to lean into those and make offers that that most people will run away from Lana North: Awesome. Lana North: Thank you very much. James Kemp: Thank you. James Kemp: Hey, Jonathan Jonathan Ells: Hey, man? Awesome. I have. So with the question with the install offer, does this work for Jonathan Ells: a 1 on one private coaching offer, or does this have to be because you were referencing? You want to front, load all your one on one work James Kemp: Present. Yeah, if it's Jonathan Ells: So so, okay, so if if I'm if I'm using, can, is it possible for me to use the install offer for my new group offer, and for my private one on one offer. Jonathan Ells: but not obviously not at the same time. But, this week, I I make a bunch of offers for my group, using the install offer and then use a similar install offer 2 weeks later for the one on one private? Or does that ? Zap? Your audience really quickly. James Kemp: if they've got distinctly different levels of access Jonathan Ells: And James Kemp: Yeah, you can have multiple install offers. James Kemp: I'm rolling out a a different one in 2 weeks. Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: Distinct front. Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: Think short term front end offer, and that one will have 2 access levels, right? And we'll have a James Kemp: a membership access level and a syndicate access level. James Kemp: And I'm considering putting a 3rd one in there as well. So selling across the spectrum. James Kemp: So yeah, you can have

. Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: Distinct front. Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: Think short term front end offer, and that one will have 2 access levels, right? And we'll have a James Kemp: a membership access level and a syndicate access level. James Kemp: And I'm considering putting a 3rd one in there as well. So selling across the spectrum. James Kemp: So yeah, you can have. James Kemp:, the the central component is that something gets done over a time period, right? James Kemp: And that's very relative to how much effort Jonathan Ells: Gotcha James Kemp: You will take, and how much effort they will take, because you could have James Kemp: For example, with your clients. James Kemp: You could have a training install offer, because people are my diet's good, but my training sucks. James Kemp: But you could also have a nutrition install offer, which is James Kemp: my my training's fine. But my diet sucks right? James Kemp: Because remember, we're talking to solution awareness in the marketplace. James Kemp: And that's why we have to go into the market James Kemp: to offer what they already want, and they believe the solution is applied to. James Kemp: It is not about what we have. It is about what they want Jonathan Ells: Got you, would that? Okay? Okay. Jonathan Ells: so and and and that doesn't . Jonathan Ells: let's say, I make a nutrition install offer this week. And then next week I do, and I do an install offer for my one on one private, because that's where I want to get some more people in right now. Will that Jonathan Ells: cause fatigue on my audience, cause that's that something's happened that I'm not getting responses anymore. I think maybe I'm I've drifted too far with my messaging. But Jonathan Ells: maybe I'm starting to talk to what I think people should should want, instead of what they want, or something that that I just have not been cognizant of. But is there such thing as an audience? Fatigue ? Because I feel the more I offer, the less I the fewer responses I get James Kemp: Yeah, if the if the offers are all over the map and nonspecific, then they're easy to ignore, and they're easy to anticipate. James Kemp: Right Jonathan Ells: Hmm. James Kemp: There's a there's Jonathan Ells: So I got to be James Kemp: Component to keeping audiences off balance James Kemp: because it keeps it interesting, keeps it novel. James Kemp: and attention is a attention is a product of novelty. James Kemp: So James Kemp: over the short time period, can you just turn around an audience and get them to respond to things immediately on mass? James Kemp: Very rarely can you condition them to relatively quickly, to receive offers very frequently. Yeah, you can James Kemp:, I said. I'm making multiple offers concurrently James Kemp: in some cases multiple times a day. James Kemp: and I get response and feedback to varying degrees across the board right? But there's also a James Kemp: a novelty factor that that induces, because people don't know what I'm going to do next. James Kemp: And when people say say to me, When is this open again? James Kemp: I always say I don't know. James Kemp: I'll open this again in the future, because they genuinely don't. James Kemp: But I also genuinely don't want them to know that even if I did Jonathan Ells: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jonathan Ells: So, okay, so right now, with this install offer, I know this is super easy for me to send to my email list really easy to send my email list

. James Kemp: I'll open this again in the future, because they genuinely don't. James Kemp: But I also genuinely don't want them to know that even if I did Jonathan Ells: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jonathan Ells: So, okay, so right now, with this install offer, I know this is super easy for me to send to my email list really easy to send my email list. But for my Instagram account and my Facebook group, how do I apply the install install offer to those things, what do I do in those case to get James Kemp: What Mikel did in the syndicate. He's in Bali. So he I think he was on the call on Tuesday. James Kemp: He did a poll on Instagram, and I can't remember James Kemp: which the 2 options one was. James Kemp: he works with coaches right? One was James Kemp: what do you want? My, what do you want my next workshop to be? James Kemp: Do you want me to cover the Instagram DM strategy, or do you want me to cover? James Kemp: I think it was his offer. Creation, strategy right? And he and he ran a poll. James Kemp: And then with polls on Instagram, you can see who the respondents are right. James Kemp: And then he just got the aggregate data, but he also had hand raisers for what people wanted. James Kemp: And so then he could go to those people. You could say. James Kemp: you can have a poll and say. James Kemp: if you could make wave a magic wand in 30 days. James Kemp: . What if? What have you done in the last 30 days. You've had a consistent training program or had a consistent nutrition. James Kemp: And, diet or something that. James Kemp: So have those it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how you phrase it. But, just have those 2 distinctions. James Kemp: because then you're going to have people who are engaging around a small idea. James Kemp: and then you could ask them. James Kemp: Hey, were you looking to install a new diet plan James Kemp: to lose weight in the next 30 days. James Kemp: Yes, I am. James Kemp: I've got something that you might want to look at. Jonathan Ells: Hey? So you gotta you gotta get them to raise their hand James Kemp: You've both Jonathan Ells: Okay, I gotta get better weight James Kemp: You've got to find the people who believe they know the solution. James Kemp: Do you understand the distinction Jonathan Ells: Huh! Jonathan Ells: No, no! Do you find the people that believe they know the solution James Kemp: Yes, because they. James Kemp: There's people who believe right now the reason they're fat. James Kemp: It's because of their training program. James Kemp: There's people that believe right now, the reason they're fat is because of their diet. James Kemp: Right? I'm just oversimplifying everything just for for an example. James Kemp: They already have the solution in their mind, but they don't know James Kemp: how to approach it. What to do. Which version of the which diet do I follow? James Kemp: They are looking for the the the narrowing of their focus around the solution. It's my diet Jonathan Ells: Okay, Jonathan Ells: I don't know how I apply that because my program does 4 thing. It's it's 4 areas at once. Nutrition, mindset training and health habits. James Kemp: We're solving for Jonathan Ells: Yes. James Kemp: Do they do? They do? They need different components of everything. Of course they do. James Kemp: Do

. It's my diet Jonathan Ells: Okay, Jonathan Ells: I don't know how I apply that because my program does 4 thing. It's it's 4 areas at once. Nutrition, mindset training and health habits. James Kemp: We're solving for Jonathan Ells: Yes. James Kemp: Do they do? They do? They need different components of everything. Of course they do. James Kemp: Do. They believe that it's 1 thing, or they want to believe. It's 1 thing, because we tend to oversimplify James Kemp: most everything, to just to to cope with the world. James Kemp: It's my dog Jonathan Ells: So you just you have to get. So my, my issue over the last little while, man, it's been driving me absolutely nuts is I can't even get people to raise their hand the 1st time. So I want to start conversations with people James Kemp: You're cooking. Jonathan Ells: And I want to start James Kemp: People are, okay, well, yeah, of course, I want to lose weight. But that means this. James Kemp: That means I have to go on a diet. That means I have to go join a gym. That means I have to be seen in public in tight clothes. That means I have to change my whole life. James Kemp: I don't want to do any of that right. Only highly highly motivated people. James Kemp: We'll sign up to general fitness and James Kemp: fitness programs that have all components of everything James Kemp: they've been told by their doctor. They need to, or they're absolutely sick to death of it, right? James Kemp: Most everyone else has an incentive on some dimension. James Kemp: Remember, we talked about the the incentive of James Kemp: someone who's reluctant to take their clothes off in front of their partner James Kemp: And then maybe the little comments are coming up, the the the loss of weight. James Kemp: It's not a representation of how good they look in the mirror. James Kemp: It's a representation of the respect they receive in their relationship, and the relationship is probably James Kemp: in some cases more important to them than their own self-esteem. James Kemp: And there are failings. James Kemp: So when we understand incentives behind James Kemp: solutions and desires of people, we can talk to those, to those incentives Jonathan Ells: So instead of so you're saying, instead of talking to losing weight, which, every person that follows me wants to lose weight. But you talk to the reason why they want to lose the weight. Jonathan Ells: So instead of saying, Hey, so you can lose 15 to 20 pounds. It's so you can feel confident. Jonathan Ells: So you can. So you can feel confident, naked with your partner again. Jonathan Ells: And but the thing is okay, that's great. But James Kemp: The reason. The reason that that most everyone wants to make money James Kemp: is because they want to feel safe. James Kemp: So the reason that most everyone wants to make money is that they want the most James Kemp: core human need, which is safety. James Kemp: because safety is proximal to survival right. James Kemp: So the reason that make money is such a big category of, selling help. And those things is because everyone wants to be safe. James Kemp: the reason that that weight, loss, and fitness are James Kemp: such big categories as both volume, because the world's fat James Kemp: and secondly, because of the the innate social James Kemp: desires that sit underneath it, but with feelings. Now, matter, vanity is now a thing James Kemp: generationally it didn't used to matter what males look

. And those things is because everyone wants to be safe. James Kemp: the reason that that weight, loss, and fitness are James Kemp: such big categories as both volume, because the world's fat James Kemp: and secondly, because of the the innate social James Kemp: desires that sit underneath it, but with feelings. Now, matter, vanity is now a thing James Kemp: generationally it didn't used to matter what males look . And now males are more vain than females. James Kemp: There's this whole category of people who are, I want to be beautiful, and I'm a man. James Kemp: So it opened up this whole marketplace because the because of the the social marketplace shifted James Kemp: so that the incentives have just changed. James Kemp: But they've got bigger. James Kemp: But the incentives underlying it are always people want to lose weight or get jacked, or whatever. James Kemp: for an underlying reason Jonathan Ells: Hmm. Jonathan Ells: okay. So I gotta do that through somehow. That's that's the hardest part, right? There is. How do I? How do I Jonathan Ells: create stories and content James Kemp: That there's a gigantic universe of reasons why people want to look good naked, and you pick one Jonathan Ells: Yeah, and you have to test it. It's just, I'm gonna do this piece of content today on this thing that I think that people want because they want to go. Look this reason that I think James Kemp: We don't need to think, though, we observe James Kemp: out in the marketplace, we observe from the data, the data is, someone else is selling it James Kemp: you? It is a transformation that you've initiated before. James Kemp: Right. All of those things are real or measurable. Jonathan Ells: Hmm. James Kemp: And then we Jonathan Ells: It's true, too. James Kemp: One dimension, different Jonathan Ells: Okay, I still fit. Okay. James Kemp: The challenge is not that there's a lack of reasons why people want to James Kemp: lose weight, as there's an above Jonathan Ells: No, I know that's what I'm saying. So James Kemp: Isolate around a singular one. Jonathan Ells: Got you. Jonathan Ells: Yeah. And only the problem is, now this is opens up more questions and more things to answer instead of finding. So I still don't know what I'm gonna post tomorrow. James Kemp: It. It does if it does. If you sit in the in the world of James Kemp: of thinking and and and believe that that's a path to progress. James Kemp: The world of action is testing and failing in the marketplace of going. No one responded to that Jonathan Ells: That's all I've done for a year and a half is test and fail James Kemp: But the paradox for most people is that we are. We are in problems of abundance. James Kemp: not problems of scarcity. James Kemp: And then we leverage. James Kemp: We are in an abundant world where we can communicate with damn near anyone on any James Kemp: particular issue and dimension. James Kemp: And then we. And then so we expand the number of things that we say to the number of people that we say. James Kemp: But when we come back to the Central, the central idea of the clients aren't scarce, but we are. James Kemp: Then there's a central idea there, that is the one that we give a shit about. James Kemp: or the one that we feel most qualified to to do, or the one that we feel most excited about. James Kemp: I I don't care about making money

. James Kemp: But when we come back to the Central, the central idea of the clients aren't scarce, but we are. James Kemp: Then there's a central idea there, that is the one that we give a shit about. James Kemp: or the one that we feel most qualified to to do, or the one that we feel most excited about. James Kemp: I I don't care about making money. James Kemp: I care about making money, and then what life it gives me James Kemp: for me and my family, right? So it's a route through. James Kemp: and I care about that a lot, and I and I care a lot about helping other people who James Kemp: who match some of those characteristics to achieve that which they call freedom. James Kemp: Right? So it's really easy for me to do what I do, and and show up to do it. James Kemp: because I just see myself as a dealer of freedom, because I have immense amounts of freedom James Kemp: on lots of different dimensions, and the beauty in that. James Kemp: and the beauty of me loving it is that I can then have a abundant mindset of I can help James Kemp: everybody be free. James Kemp: But there's only one of me. James Kemp: so I have scarcity of things I give a shit about. James Kemp: and that allows me to be abundant, whereas most people who aren't James Kemp: have a scarce idea of money. James Kemp: but they're abundant in the ways that they try and get it, and that causes scattered James Kemp: lack of focus, trying to be everything for everybody. James Kemp: and and a desire to please people rather than a desire to to help one person James Kemp: and the central, the central currency that we deal with isn't is a people. James Kemp: and all my best offers James Kemp: were a byproduct of me wanting to help one person, and the the catalyst was that. James Kemp: And it just happened that James Kemp: 10 or a hundred, or in some cases a thousand people wanted that same thing. James Kemp: And so it scaled James Kemp: because I gave a shit about the the core. The core thing that I help. People do James Kemp: hope all of that was useful. James Kemp: Pick one. Thank you. James Kemp: Pick one thing and ask them. James Kemp: Steve. James Kemp: I gotta go on a seat. James Kemp: Where'd you go? James Kemp: You're still muted Steve Roberts: You there, mate? James Kemp: Yeah. Steve Roberts: I'll get my cigarette lighter off. Now, that was a bit when I had a concept, just James Kemp: Always go there, every Steve Roberts: Really not. Steve Roberts: That was great. Jimmy James Kemp: Reaching from the mountain Steve Roberts: I just wanted to add, on top of what you were saying. I just had a meeting with the client this morning Steve Roberts: who's already lost 15 kgs. Steve Roberts: but he still has an underlying fear of taking his shirt off at the beach James Kemp: So. Steve Roberts: He's not quite there yet, but yet he's still with me. So Steve Roberts: when you said you're helping them find the route to their freedom, I think that was really Steve Roberts: quite well, well, put as far as my experience working with that particular client is, it's Steve Roberts: peeling back the layers Shrek. keep it James Kemp: Yeah
