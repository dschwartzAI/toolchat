# New Transcripts James - Part 3

. Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: I think people don't know what at well means. You can turn on when you need. James Kemp: It's a hymn right Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: And then that would be the description of that Jarred Brown: The mechanism. James Kemp: That would be the description of the what the alteration Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah, which is, step 4 in the offer, Doc, for the summit. Chronic thing James Kemp: Yeah, some good suggestions in the chat they're, activate or or step into, or too long Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: And then we lay out the phases Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: That Jarred Brown: Yep. Jarred Brown: Yeah, that's fine. James Kemp: That with people really go far enough. Right? James Kemp: I'd I've used. I've used this analogy before. What people want in transformation is that scene from the matrix when they plug the spike through the back of Neo's head and upload his black belt, Karate. James Kemp: and as Judo, and as gunfighting, and all that, whatever. I can't the movies so long ago. But that's what people want to be reprogrammed. They don't want to do the work. James Kemp: Even people who doing the work, don't want to do the work. They just want it to be plugged in Jarred Brown: Yeah, sweet. I can tie all this up just the investment part. James Kemp: Yeah. Jarred Brown: So maybe just have a bit of a a hand with with that James Kemp: So it's 3 k. For the year Jarred Brown: Yeah, I've gone up to., I've gone. I went up to 3,300 James Kemp: Okay, what's the pay plan? Jarred Brown: Pay plans 9 on a week if they do weekly, which is, ends up being 5, 1, or something that. 5, 2 James Kemp: Okay, so. Jarred Brown: So that's 4, 99. Now, something that. 3, 99. Now James Kemp: Yeah. Could you do 500 now? Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: Then 500. James Kemp: When your alter ego is installed. James Kemp: I'll let you finance the initial, or 500 James Kemp: over 4 weeks at 1 50 a week Jarred Brown: Yeah, and then James Kemp: They're just approximate, right? And then Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: They want to stay. James Kemp: You credit the you credit. You can credit the whole thing Jarred Brown: Yep. James Kemp: Against that, but you could also raise raise the price. So you still capture the same amount Jarred Brown: Yeah, so they didn't. They didn't. A $1,000 off the the summit for the year or credited a thousand dollars. What's the conversation? What's the conversation ? Jarred Brown: Are you in the back of your mind, knowing when the offer install? People are coming to an end and, what are you? Jarred Brown: What's your framing and positioning when they're coming to the end of these things, particularly to 4 weeks, is a pretty condensed period of time, what's your what's your positioning that you're taking with them as they come into the end of the 4 weeks James Kemp: I'm not. I'm I'm probably not the best example, because I'm not proactive on those things. I just let it James Kemp: unfold. James Kemp: Do you want to stay cool. What are you doing Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: Right cause it

. I'm I'm probably not the best example, because I'm not proactive on those things. I just let it James Kemp: unfold. James Kemp: Do you want to stay cool. What are you doing Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: Right cause it. And in the levels that I sell this into, it's not coaching. James Kemp: It's it's focused on getting the result. And if they want to stay, they stay, and if they don't, they don't James Kemp: bye Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: This is a coached offer. So the the when you are having the conversation is when they James Kemp: get the 1st breakthrough. James Kemp: Oh, they come back after a week, and they're that conversation we had last week changed everything after, and the weekend was completely different. James Kemp: Right? James Kemp: They get the 1st breakthrough, and you can Jarred Brown: Cheers. James Kemp: Then apply it, then Jarred Brown: Yup! James Kemp: Or they're coming to the end. And you're just asking them how the experience has been, and you'd love them to stay because they. They know now they know what the summary James Kemp: truth, because they're in it. Jarred Brown: True. James Kemp: And then it's Jarred Brown: It's easier because there's more context James Kemp: It's this. Jarred Brown: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Great. Awesome. Jarred Brown: Cool up with that. Are you just able to? Oh, there we go. Done it for me. Jarred Brown: Oh, that's what I was gonna ask, could you link this on? how you were saying the other day around your new office cycle? How you're doing shorter timeframes, even just offering something over the top of the day. Jarred Brown: Is this a really good one where it's you might I might open the summit for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Close it, and then go and then boom straight into. I'm opening one spot up Jarred Brown: to this, is this, are those . Jarred Brown: yeah, what's your thinking around the whole rhythm cycle? Now, in in conjunction with Jarred Brown: your sovereign circle centered here, and then these offering stalls James Kemp: That was the answer to the question, is baked into the the delivery piece. James Kemp: It's all about what capacity I have. Right. James Kemp: So people. People are coming to Valley next week, so I'll wipe out Tuesdays for calls. So that means I've only got Thursdays. What capacity do I have? So what offer am I opening Jarred Brown: Yeah. James Kemp: But from a market perspective, you're not necessarily Jarred Brown: Fatiguing the market. Did how you were saying the contrast between a Jarred Brown:, you might do a customer offer? And then the following week you have A, and you're contrasting between price. Could you easily could you easily promote this the day after James Kemp: I'm going on way higher cadence than I'm going on a way higher cadence than that now. James Kemp: because fundamentally, I'm I'm making 2 to 4 distinct offers. A week Jarred Brown: Cool. James Kemp: But I'm also making those offers in different places. So James Kemp: 50% of the time I've opened the offer installed this year, it wasn't even to the list in public. It wasn't even to the community. It was people who had missed out on the 1st few ones. Right? James Kemp: So I'm running multiple multiple tracks of demand

. A week Jarred Brown: Cool. James Kemp: But I'm also making those offers in different places. So James Kemp: 50% of the time I've opened the offer installed this year, it wasn't even to the list in public. It wasn't even to the community. It was people who had missed out on the 1st few ones. Right? James Kemp: So I'm running multiple multiple tracks of demand. James Kemp: So I'm I'm making one offer James Kemp: publicly, if you, to the list and social, I'm making another offer James Kemp: in the community our hours, or an upgrade to the syndicate, or something that. And then I'm making yet another offer to a group of people who responded to the last offers, but missed out. James Kemp: So the cadence that I'm moving out I'm of James Kemp: 2 active offers at any time, and then publicly, I'm moving through James Kemp: 2 or 3 offers a week. James Kemp: cause there's always something coming up right Jarred Brown: Sounds rhythm. 2 point O is on the horizon. James Kemp: But it's it's kind. James Kemp: It's a lot my thinking around content. And the idea of a calendar, right. James Kemp: that you're going to make a particular offer James Kemp: in the future. And it's going to do this thing James Kemp: doesn't necessarily reflect what is happening in that future. James Kemp: because if I've got a full calendar of calls. And then I'm going, hey? I'm gonna fill up my calendar even more with calls. James Kemp: because I said I was going to, and I planned to do it, that as counterproductive. James Kemp: it's not productive. It's counterproductive, right? Because James Kemp: there is only so much capacity James Kemp: at the upper, at the upper levels of our access and attention. James Kemp: And so the rhythm for me, it's not based on James Kemp: what I said I'm going to do James Kemp: is what capacity I have coming up Jarred Brown: Yeah, makes sense. Jarred Brown: And the cool thing about these little offering stores, or from my case is 4 weeks is Jarred Brown: you might have a really great client result and Boom feel really inspired to talk about it and then make it straight in office, look at your calendar. It's empty for next week and make an office straight away on on one of these little offering stalls James Kemp: Yeah, the I made a video yesterday about how to go fast, how to go slow. James Kemp: And I've seen I see this a lot. James Kemp: I often give people something that's worked for the 1st time ever James Kemp: I give them an offer that's they've never had something that got a response rate the . The offer that we do together. James Kemp: So what they do is they make it, and then they thrash the shit out of it. James Kemp: For a few weeks James Kemp: they extract all the demand from their audience, and then they do it one last time, the 3rd or the 4th time, and nothing happens. James Kemp: and they've pulled all the demand out of their available audience. James Kemp: and then they demoralize themselves and they go. James Kemp: Oh, but that people aren't buying. Yeah, but you've just signed 18 people Jarred Brown: And James Kemp: Calendar is absolutely groaning with stuff. And James Kemp: and they're, yeah. But people aren't responding. I'm James Kemp: managing the ebbs and flows of these things is what keeps people in the game, and what do they do? They stop and they go

. James Kemp: Oh, but that people aren't buying. Yeah, but you've just signed 18 people Jarred Brown: And James Kemp: Calendar is absolutely groaning with stuff. And James Kemp: and they're, yeah. But people aren't responding. I'm James Kemp: managing the ebbs and flows of these things is what keeps people in the game, and what do they do? They stop and they go. It's the offer. James Kemp: No, it's it's the relative demand that was available to you at the time. With this offer. James Kemp: Right? James Kemp: And then they go. Hey! This install offer or this 8 weeks offer, and then they do another 8 week offer, and then they fill up the capacity again the rinse, all that demand out of it. James Kemp: And then, 2 months later, they've grown. James Kemp: but they don't know what to do next. James Kemp: because they they've got poor retention off the back of it, because most of the people left, etc. Because they. James Kemp: if you if you prioritize short term response rates on everything. James Kemp: you will just live in this 48 to 72 h anxiety cycle about what's going to happen, and how many people are buying in that time? James Kemp: Right? James Kemp: But if you forecast James Kemp: how much capacity you want to have, and how much you want to supply, and how many people you want to work with and who they are. James Kemp: Then what you find is that you can just deploy the different offers. You've got James Kemp: to just keep that filled up to the brim at about 80 or 90% Jarred Brown: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Jarred Brown: Yep, James Kemp: And if you don't give a fuck about James Kemp: how you feel about any of it, and you want to make the most amount of money. You just James Kemp: expand the calendar, work more hours, fill it up even more, etc, etc. And then James Kemp: just just wait for the burnout. James Kemp: It will just come later because you're a bit tougher than other people. Jarred Brown: Yeah, no, that's cool. It's it is. It does come back to your principles, your workflow, your calendar, and how many people you went on board, and Jarred Brown: this is really cool, because it does show me the skill in unbundling, bundling offer creation packaging whilst keeping the model the same . Jarred Brown: It is very, very yeah, it's very cool. So thanks for sharing, because Jarred Brown: you're now integrating the models not changing, but the way in which your packaging offers come into the model. So it's giving me more creative ways to see how to bundle and unbundle and package things up James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: The the aim for me is to give you the toolkit, but you have to use a sermon about how you deploy it. James Kemp: I've been in this. I've been doing this for a decade, and I can continue to do this for another decade, because I have the capacity to do 19 calls in a week to an extremely high level, but I also also have the capacity to do absolutely nothing in a week, when I don't want to James Kemp: right, and my ability to do both of those extremes keeps me in the game. James Kemp: because I'm perfectly okay with doing absolutely nothing for long periods of time, and just sitting on my ass and waiting for the waiting for it to strike again

. James Kemp: because I'm perfectly okay with doing absolutely nothing for long periods of time, and just sitting on my ass and waiting for the waiting for it to strike again. James Kemp: Right? James Kemp: But I'm also perfectly okay with pushing a motherfucker and working harder and at a at a higher level than most people. James Kemp: So I can manage both extremes, because for a lot of people nothing happening is more torturous than James Kemp: everything happening all at once. James Kemp: And so my ability to sit in both places James Kemp: allows me to keep in the game, and the long term outcome is balanced right? It's just balanced through exchange. James Kemp: And so Jarred Brown: Love it James Kemp: Understanding what capacity we have at any one time James Kemp: is the discernment we need to go. Where's the toolkit going to go Jarred Brown: Yeah, how? What am I gonna use in it? Jarred Brown: I'll I'll tidy up some words and make an offer on it today before. So that's cool James Kemp: See you later. James Kemp: Hey, Caroline? Caroline Carpenter: Hey? There! Caroline Carpenter: So so I oh, I'm sorry. What James Kemp: No zoom just did a zoom thing Caroline Carpenter: Did a weird thing. Sorry. I took my hand down, and then it switched me. So Caroline Carpenter: I want to check my thinking on this offer install. Caroline Carpenter: It might not be well, I know it's gonna be simpler than my brain is making it. Caroline Carpenter: and I've got my launch coming up. Caroline Carpenter: and I'm going to put this in front of a few women first, st and I'm wondering if my timing is way off as far as the weeks that I've delegated out. If if speed is the thing. Caroline Carpenter: the goal is Caroline Carpenter: so I'm in the position of I want to help women get to 10 K. Monthly recurring revenue in 10 h per week, 25 clients or less. That's my goal I'm assuming there's well, that's several other women's goals, too. If I'm going to paint the vision for them. So I've had months higher than that. But it was not monthly recurring. Caroline Carpenter: so I'm going to avoid having imposter syndrome right now. But this offer is installation of the soulful CEO blueprint. Caroline Carpenter: Where most women go wrong is, they keep applying all of their focus and energy in all the wrong places. Caroline Carpenter: and it just goes to crap. Caroline Carpenter: So I've got 3 phases. It's more of a how do I frame up the bigger container while making it look a quick, moving offer that will get a result because I don't. I cannot ethically promise money in the beginning, because it Caroline Carpenter: the women I end up working with it doesn't? Well, one did it in 4 weeks, but that was high intensity, one on one, and I'm removing myself from that. I've already made someone mad with that. But anyway, my capacity. So Caroline Carpenter: I'm unsure how to properly position this ethically James Kemp: Need to position the the whole thing Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: No James Kemp: the direction . I don't position the syndicate at all in any of this, that I just put them in it, and then they James Kemp: they make up their own mind Caroline Carpenter: So I don't even need to say, here's phase 2 and 3. Do I even throw money in there, or say, this is the goal, because it's not a promise immediately. I think I'm James Kemp: What what is, what is available

. I don't position the syndicate at all in any of this, that I just put them in it, and then they James Kemp: they make up their own mind Caroline Carpenter: So I don't even need to say, here's phase 2 and 3. Do I even throw money in there, or say, this is the goal, because it's not a promise immediately. I think I'm James Kemp: What what is, what is available. James Kemp: And so it's audience that you're speaking to to me. James Kemp: Awesome. James Kemp: Excuse me for me. James Kemp: A solution. Awareness of an offer James Kemp: is the only is the only thing I need to work with right. James Kemp: I also have people in the audience a solution awareness of I need a James Kemp: I need a funnel which gives me 10 leads a day, or whatever, all of those could be install offers for me. So what what is present in the audience on a on a solution basis Caroline Carpenter: Women with a skill set that are making money the way they've been told they've been making it and doing everything they don't want to, and it's a simple restructuring of their offers Caroline Carpenter: right now, from our perspective James Kemp: Okay, so what what puts them in motion? Caroline Carpenter: You mean as in prior James Kemp: If they could wave a magic wand James Kemp: to make next week better than this week what would show up Caroline Carpenter: Oh. Caroline Carpenter: this would be where the one move comes in to stop doing the things they don't want to do James Kemp: Which are what. Caroline Carpenter: Overworking, being scattered, going not need to nothing, getting nowhere, going to burnout James Kemp: How James Kemp: ? Where are they spending their time? On? What things are they gonna stop doing, and what things are they? What one thing Caroline Carpenter: That's wrong. James Kemp: Jumping from thing to thing to thing, overthinking how they're gonna get to, where they're going Caroline Carpenter: Sticking to one thing is very hard for them. James Kemp: Yeah, why? Caroline Carpenter: Oh, they're doing everything they've been told to do versus what they want to do. Caroline Carpenter: So running business is the way they've been told to do that. It's completely out of alignment with how they operate Caroline Carpenter: connected to themselves. Caroline Carpenter: Yeah. James Kemp: So what do they want to show up Caroline Carpenter: Where do they want to show up James Kemp: What do they want to? What do they want to see happen for them? To James Kemp: have the feeling that this is going in the right direction Caroline Carpenter: Oh. Caroline Carpenter: well, this is where the sense of relief comes in. I'm not sure I'm clear enough on that yet. I'm still working James Kemp: Wow! Caroline Carpenter: Hmm! Caroline Carpenter: Clients that they would to spend the day off with James Kemp: How many. Caroline Carpenter: That's a great question. Caroline Carpenter: Depends on if they're close proximity or far proximity, and James Kemp: It always depends Caroline Carpenter: Right right? Caroline Carpenter: Probably a few, a few close proximity 3, I would say, and 10 ish Caroline Carpenter: with distance between them. James Kemp: So for for most people. James Kemp: The one is enough. Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Caroline Carpenter: One. Okay, so, your next. James Kemp: They've never. They've never experienced Caroline Carpenter: Yeah, I, James Kemp: They've never experienced a. They've experienced a high quality client, but they came and went right Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Yes. Caroline Carpenter: Yes
