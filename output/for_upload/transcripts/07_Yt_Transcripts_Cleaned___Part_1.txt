YT Five Steps To Positioning Your Brand in 2025 (Behind The Scenes) the world is in chaos Well they'd have you believe it So when things get chaotic and when things get crazy in the news and the marketplace and everyone's confused about what to do and then positioning yourself has never been more important and on this morning's call so my circle my inner circle people who have private access to me get together every Tuesday to jam on what they're working on etc And this morning I did something on positioning So positioning yourself in a market positioning yourself for now making yourself relevant making yourself attractive making yourself safe to buy so I spent 20 minutes taking the guys through exactly how to position the five steps of doing it how to think about the different components how what to consider what to discuss etc etc and then we went we jammed on it I want to share that first bit with you I think it's super relevant It's super helpful right now and I hope you get a ton of value from it I want to do a ditty on positioning as the it's time shall we say I think for in the next in the next while there's going to be tons of winners and losers and the it will come down to not so much what you're selling as how you're positioned in the and who you're selling to And that is I this I this bit because the positioning yourself correctly in a in the marketplace makes all the stuff you've already got better not just better in terms of its actual functionally better but it makes it more pointy in terms of the the stuff you do for people and also the stuff you the stuff you say out there So I the old all the copyrightiting formulas and AIA and all that stuff And there was one that works in copy but it works much better in positioning which is positioning in the market And the the major mistake that people have with positioning is they they look at their competitors and trying to position themselves relatively against what other people are doing And this is a this is the most common mistake if you because when things get uncertain people look for certainty So they start looking sideways and they go a so and so is doing that and they attribute things that they can see and they attribute status of the person who's doing them to what they should do next Right so they position themselves competition rather than position themselves against the the customer and the market conditions Okay I can hear myself back How come I can hear myself back ross is putting me through a voice I think I think I I have a There's five there's five pieces right and there's verify validate vantage values and the villain So verify is what people are seeing now or what they've seen in the past right and so when there's kind of chaos out there people get acutely aware of what where they are and how prepared they are for it So a ton of people who are retired right now and watching their their retirement accounts dwindle are feeling 
> "Oh All the all the investments I made in these things well maybe they were a mistake."

So they they see things and then the things that they see we validate their feelings right so when you verify you're seeing if I do the people that I talk to rising costs in ads you're seeing old models not working You're seeing unreliable stuff you're seeing or experiences with coaches So that you're seeing all these things the these things have happened to them right and this is what they see And it can either be the immediate things they're seeing or the things they've done in the past You validate how they feel So that makes you feel uncertain on what moves to make that makes you s uncertain on who to trust right and then you you present your vantage point This is what playing out I see solo one person businesses with low overheads and easy to buy offers as duh duh weathering the storm are going through this and then the values are the common things this is the where you introduce the Why why would I do that well I'm a father and a husband and I want my time and I want my to spend time on my health and my body and with my family and so therefore I'm building this business so I can look after my family Right this is this is the reason why I'm doing it These are all the these are all the logical reasons why these are the things you're seeing This is this is why you feel that with them This is the vantage point that I come from The best type of business is a solo offer driven business with multiple modalities deployed You've got one time offers You've got ways to acquire clients and you've got ways to ways to you're just introducing them to the idea And then the villain is complexity teams hiring costs gurus selling who are selling the the the old thing and you'll see some of the stuff in my content I'll be not calling out specific people but I'll be pointing out that there's people selling ideas that they know don't work in the market anymore right and so when you go through this when you go through this exercise with your content and the positioning then you go through a you go through a journey of taking someone through that you're displaying empathy that you understand what they're seeing you're acknowledging their feelings So you're being empathetic about that that that they are scared confused angry that these are the things they hate These are enemies And of course if you are hyper political you would you would position the enemy as a particular individual or a person you need to do these things so you can get over that over the man right and you could name the man if if if you had them And then the the the vantage point is that this is what I see So this is the this is the bit where you're introducing this is the way forward and this is the way that you need to go in times of high chaos You need to be the most certain person in the marketplace Right you need to present even if you don't possess it 100% confidence that the the methods the philosophy that the strategy that you're that you're presenting right now is the best thing for that person right and there's no room for may the more chaotic the overall environment in the marketplace the more uncertainty that's spinning around and there's just high levels of uncertainty spinning everywhere and there has been for quite some time Then the more certain you need to be about this is the way and the more you need to dismiss the other may and the potentials right so high chaos is is counterbalanced by high certainty And if you look at the the talking head marketplace or the marketplace of ideas or the social marketplace the people who are sometimes incomprehensibly confident about exactly what's going to happen are the ones that get followed along right the people who are this is happening to the economy and this is why tariffs are this and this is people are listening to them because they have that certainty of outcome right and so if we are leading people and selling them we need to have that level of certainty that almost irrational confidence that this is the way It needs to be

talking head marketplace or the marketplace of ideas or the social marketplace the people who are sometimes incomprehensibly confident about exactly what's going to happen are the ones that get followed along right the people who are this is happening to the economy and this is why tariffs are this and this is people are listening to them because they have that certainty of outcome right and so if we are leading people and selling them we need to have that level of certainty that almost irrational confidence that this is the way It needs to be underpinned by true belief and confidence But you you need to hold that that that that certain future as as the the the values piece is obviously people want to understand who you are and the that's the most I think that's the most imperceptible shift in the marketplace in the last couple of years that the the how has become commoditized and the who has been has been a lot stronger We we are much more subject to the influence of who is doing something than than how they're doing it because the the strategies that many of us do and teach and implement and those things are pretty commoditized everybody does them or different variations of them So the who is very important So you're positioning the values and the the easiest the easiest way to think about values is the common why You know what drives you what's important to you etc And then the the or the aspirational will attract the and then the villain And the villain is a stylistic thing I personally don't call people out right by name or by specifics And I don't even I don't even go very far when I'm using villains I will use conceptual villains in in any positioning I have bloated bloated teams and overheads and costs And I will use the villains as ideas Different people have different and sometimes very effective ways of deploying this but most everybody who has something that people are paying attention to will have some villain right something that resonates which is the the us and them thing that this raises because all of these positions just raise contrast that's what they do And so when when there's a clear this is us and this is them this is the villain you know and we're the good guys then it it it has a much stronger attraction component So positioning is fun in my mind because we can take a lot of stuff that already exists and just run it through the filter to ensure it's positioned against something to make it much more fundamentally strong Everybody has got something that's fun that's robust and fundamentally strong when people are put into it and put through it But the way that we get more people to see that i

.e the way we get more people to engage with us the way we get more people to engage with the ideas and and is contrasted against something And if you think about positioning in brand or positioning in content or positioning in copy they largely do the same thing where they're just having a high level of contrast but if you use those frames to go what are people seeing how are they feeling how do you present the vantage point what are the values and and then positioning it against the the alternatives then you're just going to be that the message will be that much stronger relative to the noise that's out there which is ever present and it's this isn't none of this is new but we go through these cycles and I I think the last major destabilization of what the is going to happen next was probably co and I think a lot of people are looking at the world now and being told that everything's changed and maybe it has and maybe it hasn't but ultimately if we position ourselves adequately then people will will look at our version of the future much more coherently Anyone need that notes or screenshot i'll drop it in there WhatsApp too Any questions about that any commentary super relevant How to Get Rich Fast, How to Get Rich Slow big rain overnight the pool has way too much water in it but rainy season is never ending so you want to get rich fast well this is how you do it so the absolute biggest opportunity for a high margin high profit fast business these days is selling expertise honestly it doesn't really matter how because you can offer services you can do stuff for people you can coach people you can mentor people you can consult on it but the absolute fastest way to get rich is by selling expertise and you get rich by packaging that up into a predefined solution that you sell for between $5 and $10,000 on a phone call and you do whatever you possibly can to get people on the telephone and then you make them an offer and you sell it and here's two really really dirty secrets about this it doesn't even have to be good to make money because if you want to get rich quick you don't care about the long term if you want to get rich quick and it's all about the money then you don't care about delivering results you don't care about reputation you don't really care about how happy your clients are and you don't really care how happy you are because to get rich really really fast the biggest secret is that you have to place the the ideal of getting rich over and above all feelings the only feeling that you have to cater for to get rich really fast is how someone feels about buying off you in that interim in that beginning point when you're making the offer and getting someone's money for you it's unethical it's inhuman and it's unsustainable right in all of those factors and the way to get rich is through helping other people get what they want and if you want to get really really rich really fast then you need to place your feelings to the side you you know this is what hustle culture is hustle culture is the ability to hustle no matter what no matter how you feel no matter how low you feel how depressed you feel no matter how sad you feel how tired you feel you've just got to go and get it done make the sale chase the person close the deal and what everybody goes through or goes into a period of time that I'm not embarrassed to say that I've been in that state many many times of it doesn't matter how I feel about this i'm just going to I'm just going to sell it I know this isn't the absolute best thing I can sell at this time and I'm and I'm still working out how to get results from it but I'm still going to sell it and I'll work it out and you know what i did work it out i did work out how to deliver results to everybody that I sell to and I did work out how to how to ultimately get out of the it doesn't matter how

." And sometimes that is true if the the goal is over and above your immediate your immediate feelings about it if you need money right now because you need to put food on the table I'd argue it doesn't really matter how you feel about what you need to do and that's where people dip into the the unethics and the and fraud and all these horrible things but the the way to get rich slowly in the way is do something for a really really long period of time and that means you become rich on all dimensions you become rich financially you become rich emotionally because you build resilience over long periods of time you become rich reputationally where people will come and seek you out where people will tell other people to seek you out where people trust you just because of your word and your name and that is how you also stay rich and I'm starting to expand the pure definition of rich because you probably clicked on this thinking about okay he's going to tell me how to make money and one dimension of being rich is definitely monetary true freedom is downstream of financial freedom but also people are really really happy for you to get rich if you do it with them people will resist you at every turn if you try and get rich from them and if you try and play zero sum games with money or status or reputation then they may seem to work for a while but they won't work long term so speed at different times matters and this is why the discernment of the individual useps everything else i have clients who we make a rational decision to to push and to hustle we make a rational decision to it doesn't really matter how you feel about this the next couple of weeks are just going to be a grind but you're going to bring in this much money and on the other side of this you built this asset on the other side of this this is delivered and you've got something established that then you can pull back from and sustain and I've got clients who are right up against the grindstone nose to the grindstone and they won't stop because they fear getting off the money train or they won't stop because they fear what people will think and we have to agree to pull them back and and take a dip take the dip take the take the going backwards take the slowing down for a period of time because we agree it's unsustainable to do this and if they don't then their big their risk is to go to zero and that's the way that you you know get poor and you get kicked out of the game is when you go to zero when you can't do it anymore when you can't sustain it etc etc which is all to say discerning on knowing what you truly need at the time defines how you solve the problem and how far you are prepared to push on that on all dimensions energetically and emotionally and financially and practically so you can get rich all the different ways that's I don't want to say it's never been easier but it's definitely never been simpler it's never been harder on so many dimensions mainly because there are so many options on what to do and who to listen to and that's some people just need to stop listening to everyone and just listen to one person and it doesn't really matter who it is because if they follow someone who's done it before and walk that path then they should follow them and ignore everybody else but it's never been simpler in terms of the opportunities and it's never been simpler in terms of the models The Fastest Way to $100k/mo Coaching Biz (And why I'm not doing it) I'm going to tell you what the absolute fastest way to make profit for the semi- average slightly above average person in 2025 is and I'm also going to tell you exactly why I'm not doing it as my Mr thine would say no cap for real for real and so to tell you what's the fastest I need to tell you that I've done it three times and three times starting almost a decade ago which was

.3 million us at the time then I did that again and then I did it again and the formula to this day works the formula of having a very high margin coaching training Consulting product that shows someone how to get a defined result over a defined time period that's sold for5 plus th000 via the telephone if you want the absolute fastest way to grow start and grow a profitable coaching Consulting business in 2025 the answer has been the same for about 8 years do that that is the fastest way because what you will do is have the highest margin product and as long as you f the product to the market you will have demand for it you as long as you can have a promise that people want they want to make money they want a better body a better relationship a better life whatever it may be there's only four categories I've covered them many times look out the videos make money save money live a better life or stay at a jail you got to be selling in one of those categories the absolute fastest way to sell that is on the telephone the absolute fastest way is to get people on the phone understand their current state understand the gap between the current state and their desired future State present your program as the desired future State and and then get their money and then put them in something that's high leverage to deliver you can get to multiple six figures a month doing that if you spend every waking hour hustling posting content to get people on the phone you get them on the phone and you sell 40% to 50% of those people into that product you'll make a ton of money you'll get some of those people results depending on your skill level how experienced you are how good you are the scope of the promise Etc that's the most variables that to this day is the absolute fastest way to do it the reason I'm not doing that is that it's a young man's game and what I realized after years and years of doing that the trade-offs that have to happen in the pursuit of growth and the pursuit of money are not trade-offs that I'm prepared to make so nowadays I have programs with defined promises I have a mentorship program that has no promises whatsoever it just allow people to look over my shoulder and share insights with them and and give them office hours a couple of times we where they can ask me questions it doesn't have a single promise in the world it's solded via a Google doc I will not get on a call I will only get on a call with people who invest in consulting or I've invested in them in terms of taking them as a coaching client and commitment or they're in The Syndicate and part of the mentorship and the reason that the call based system as a as a young man's game is requires a lot of energy and a lot of time and at my stage of life I have two children both of them over there right now I have two dogs both of them over there right now I have another child on the way I have a wonderful relationship I love to travel I love to do absolutely nothing for long periods of time I love to stuff around I'm wearing these clothes cuz I'm about to go on an hourong walk and listen to a podcast before our Chef arrives and cook and and Cooks us dinner tonight I don't want to be on the telephone all the time I want to spend time doing those things I want to spend time with the kids I want to spend time swing my pool I want to spend time chasing the dogs on the beach I want to spend time with my soon to be new wife and the the the young man's game is the fastest way to make money because you can deploy a lot of energy into it you can get people on the phone you can hustle you can grind you can do all those things and you make a ton of money and you might want to keep doing that or you might want to take it to the next level where you start hiring people you build a sales team to sell that you
