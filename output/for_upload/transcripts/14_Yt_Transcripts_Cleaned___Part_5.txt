# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 5

with different people at scale who are joining programs or joining group are very very high right and the more variables you have of the people joining your program the more you have to have infrastructure that caters for those variables so a practical example is the more variables you have the more questions you need and the more customer support you need the more questions you get in your group on your calls etc etc so from an efficiency point of view I found that having a onetoone call with somebody and having and Catering for the variables there in that first instance especially if you're still in a growth phase of giving them the map but show them their terrain which is you've got this you've got this here are some three or four ways to accelerate the things you've already got so they're not going on a linear path is the highest leverage piece which is giving them the map which is the same map for everybody but helping them plot the terrain themselves so that condenses the customization and gets them results quicker because they can they can more use utilization some unfair advantages they've already got or assets have' already got or resources whatever it is and and get a get a much faster start but you've also got less support to go along the way because you've catered for most of the variables in the plan so I found that unless you're some running something really massive where you're signing up dozens or thousands or hundreds or whatever people a week then giving someone a plan at some level whether it's you or a coach or or someone you've got there or get getting them to fill in a plan and bringing it to a place where you can do it on mass and customize it yeah as the fastest way to condense that and give the most variables but while while still sticking to a plan that they can execute and you can support them on yeah so I want to go granular for a Program Curriculum second because how I see it is if you go to a Bad Doctor you present symptoms and they give you medication and they say oh you've got you feel this take this pill three times a day or whatever a great doctor will look at the foundations and the fundamentals right sleep nutrition hydration movement sunlight stress and then based on your needs once those things are taken care of and you've dialed in the fundamentals they give you supplements medicines whatever it might be to supplement right the foundational work that you're doing and so when someone comes into outworld for example there is the foundational curriculum that you don't have to go at through a through Zed but there are steps you have to go through before you start getting individualized prescriptions yeah right so it's you have to go through these modules so we we call it the first steps they go through is onboarding and Mastery so it's this is how you succeed in our world here are values this is the road map to 100 month profit then Mastery is about self-image setting goals all those types of things then we start to get individually prescriptive right if you've already got momentum and you're making money and you just want to tweak your offer great go here if you have a great offer and it's already converting in your s traffic great go here yeah and I think one of the things that people struggle with is holding tensions do I tell them what to do or do I create a buffet and they can choose their own adventure and the answer is both right and so I I I will State my strong opinion here I would love to know what you think I think most people and when I say most you would have to be the reare exception should either be doing the work for people or doing it with them I would say the the rare case is when you just teach people to do it themselves CU most people just don't have the skills or to create a curriculum and create an environment and hold a community culture to where it can be hands off so I think either you're you're providing a service yeah or you're doing one toone coaching yeah for me this whole idea of scale where people

most you would have to be the reare exception should either be doing the work for people or doing it with them I would say the the rare case is when you just teach people to do it themselves CU most people just don't have the skills or to create a curriculum and create an environment and hold a community culture to where it can be hands off so I think either you're you're providing a service yeah or you're doing one toone coaching yeah for me this whole idea of scale where people are in their first 10 15 20 clients and they're trying to hire a coach and have a community manager and have a client consur perf 12 videos that do exactly the same thing a thousand times even now I'll record a video and I'll think of 10 things I could have said better or things I didn't include and even at my level I'm still thinking about ways in which I can get better and ways in which I'm dropping the ball and going oh my gosh but but do you do you agree or how do that because I think so many people that the headline on the Facebook ad of stop stop Ono one coaching and start a group program I think is a really sexy promise I think too many people don't have the skills to go straight into group coaching straight into a leverage model I think you build programs around people rather than build them for them okay right which is I think we're saying the same thing you you are a service provider so you get in there and you solve problems and your skill levels go up to Pat and match how you solve those problems at scale so the evolution of your teaching I would guess your stuff is getting shorter and more refined and it's improving in that because you're getting better and the average length of my training videos over the years have gone that because I can say what I need to say used to take me 60 minutes and now I can do it an eight so it's the refinement down but I I don't make when people join my community I don't make them go through a lineer piece I customize every single person even when they join at 300 bucks a week right now price is going up five spots left don't wait the even even when they're coming in now I give every person a 30- minute call because I know that I can save eight weeks of them going through stuff and down into that that the next eight weeks are much more on their path and on their Journey Y and I get faster results and also people don't leave but the most important point I think here is that you haven't graduated from one toone One to One Coaching coaching you still do it I still do it I've added $40,000 a month I'm recurring Revenue in the last 3 weeks and it's all onetoone Consulting and so there's this fallacy that I see people believe that they're they do the hard yards of I'm doing onetoone calls and I'm doing the $130 an hour type things I did when I started and now we're experts and we're really good and we've graduated out of it but I think this whole idea is firstly it's crazy cuz people graduating far too early they don't have the skills they don't have the ability to communicate really succinctly clearly give people what they need they don't even know what people need and I think this whole idea of onetoone coaching and being really Hands-On is so interesting to me because I'm getting opportunities now where my hourly rate is $3 to $4,000 an hour right we have a unique tax situation so that's not only mostly profit it's mostly takehome and then I compare that to the $133,000 $13 an hour I was making 5 years ago the gap between here and there is thousands of hours of one toone coaching yeah so people go the trenches right that sounds amazing how do I create an offer around that it's well you probably can't because you don't

now where my hourly rate is $3 to $4,000 an hour right we have a unique tax situation so that's not only mostly profit it's mostly takehome and then I compare that to the $133,000 $13 an hour I was making 5 years ago the gap between here and there is thousands of hours of one toone coaching yeah so people go the trenches right that sounds amazing how do I create an offer around that it's well you probably can't because you don't have the skills and so I think there's just something to be said about creating business models that yes doesn't suck you're not I'm not spending 30 hours a week one to one coaching but I'll spend 5 to 10 hours a week oneto one with clients because number one it's really profitable people love buying onetoone it's its own unique mechanism in a lot of ways right having a onetoone coach but number two it makes me so good at what I do and I think there's just this crazy belief that people get to 10K a month and they did the hard yards of one to1 and now we're going to launch a course and that's going to get me to seven figure freedom and I'm just going to check into the community once a week and I just think it's bull crap it is but but those people are trying to get away from the pain they've already created M so they think that scaling themselves out of it is the way to do it right so they go well this thing is causing me pain which is one to one so therefore the thing that will provide relief from that pain is not doing one to one y and then the answer lies in a much more Nuance place somewhere in the middle of that is it it depends but when are you I always go back to leverage when are you going to deploy leverage yeah when are you what complexity of you gone through so your clients go through Simplicity right cuz that's Mastery you someone has to go through complexity because to get extraordinary results in anything you need to understand the complex variables that go into getting results of anything the body business relationships ever they're complicated machines and complicated systems someone needs to go through complexity and the idea that you can just package everything up and throw it at a client and go there you go work it out and I'll see you on Wednesday at a

. every week is is fiction unless you've done an extraordinary amount of hours before that to go listen 95% of people are going to get results by doing this so someone's got to go through complexity and if you're good then the leverage that you get from a 20 minute 30 minute one to one piece yeah will provide leverage to that client which is weeks and months yeah in terms of getting them back but you're rewarded for that if they're paying to stay around and the on a practical note How Many Hours the the nuances live within the terms onetoone coaching how many hours how frequently what are we covering on those one of the things that I did that I made a huge mistake on when I first started one one coaching as I had my one of my first clients I think was coaching client number three paid for a year of one to one coaching up front so I had 52 1our sessions did you make the did you did you offer it that it was once a week yeah yeah I did that that was a mistake oh it was a mistake but not only that he was rich so he didn't he didn't he didn't need the coaching no and that's another no one really does yeah yeah yeah but but the challenge was he was a wealthy investor and he wanted to share his knowledge and so I would jump on a call with him and I would I'm trying to fill out the hour it wasn't about an outcome it was just selling the deliverable right an hour I was teaching and then we would assign to-do list and then we get back to the next week I was hey did you do what we were talked about and he's no I didn't I'm how am I going to fill this hour I'm rehash same and then now all my onet to1 clients get two 30 minute sessions a week a month sorry and so that's every two weeks 30 minutes I teach nothing I answer no Q&A stuff we are working on high level strategic game plan stuff so the nuances are not just within skills and how advanced are you it's you can structure it differently to where clients are getting better results and you're not getting burnt out so when I had I got to 95,000 a month in profit in April of this year when I after I burnt everything down and I rebuilt with one to one with 31 to1 clients but that was only8 hours of coaching per week right to make over a million dollars run rate and profit so it's how you structure it as well so coming back to this this 100K a month plan that we're building for people now so 3 to four month thing dream outcome I would say more Hands-On than not and especially in the early stages build skills get really good at what you do become obsessed with helping people go through complexity so they can experience Simplicity how do you think about pricing because there's not a magic price it's not when we when we joined Sam we keep referencing him because obviously that was our shared history when we started out he had a $5,800 price point that then we all came out and did a $ 5800 5800 so it's so much more nuanced right depending on your skill and what you value your time at and all of that it's nuanced someone's group program could start at at $3,500 and that might be a great price point for them starting out you started out at 2500 other people should be double or triple that but how do you think about it in terms of putting together that core offer for people to be pricing it in such a way that it's do you look at competitors do you how do you think about that so I I pretty much exclusively use weekly pricing and it's a bit of a thing M around around my parts because it it it offers the lowest now number to get started you're presenting a low number relative to a low number relative to the high numbers that generally get presented on high ticket yeah so

but how do you think about it in terms of putting together that core offer for people to be pricing it in such a way that it's do you look at competitors do you how do you think about that so I I pretty much exclusively use weekly pricing and it's a bit of a thing M around around my parts because it it it offers the lowest now number to get started you're presenting a low number relative to a low number relative to the high numbers that generally get presented on high ticket yeah so I found that the the the easiest offers to to make and easiest offers to create are also the easiest offers to buy and an easy offer to buy is match with a price that's easy to say yes to so a few hundred bucks a week and got clients Who start at 100 and start at 800 relative to their to the market there in so I think I just with pricing it's an infinitely we could do 10 podcasts on pricing because it's infinitely nuanced andely perspective but the the the key things are for me are lower than now number to get started the priority is getting people started it's not it's not making profit necessarily on day one it's getting someone started and building a an LTV and building a long-term relationship with them yeah because it's hard to sell things you don't want to do it you you want to minimize the number of sales you make to the number of people you make by keeping them the longest possible time so I'm a big proponent of having pricing that makes it easy to get started for someone and that's that's obviously relative to the market and easy to stay easy to stay because if they're paying $300 a week because let's get into the nitty-gritty here right so it's Pricing someone's committing to a I can't do the math but $300 time 16 right what is that don't do public math 4,800 yeah 4,800 thank you thank you James so 4800 so what I would do is I I I if if you want to incentivize cash up front yeah the easiest way to do that is prepaid discounts in my experience right so if you're not in a season of stacking recurring Revenue but you're trying to stack cash because you're trying to get yourself out of a hole Yeah having prepaid discounts where it's it's 4,800 paid across 16 weeks or if you want to save 20% Which is $800 you can prepaid today and that makes it $4,000 it's the opposite of what most of the industry does which is they penalize people who go on high ticket payments it's the opposite way right opposite frame it's $4,000 or if you want to split your payments it's now 5,000 or 6,000 it's just arbitrary numbers you're penalizing poor people right it's oh you can't afford the full amount we're going to make it more for you so it's reverse it's not 4,800 by the way it's 4 4,400 embarrassing embarrassing and so so we got weekly pricing you can have a prepaid discount if you want cash up front what I do is at the end of 16 weeks let's say you can do a couple of things firstly this comes this is my experience is that it comes down your level of confidence if you have a killer program that's getting amazing results you can sell a longer time frame so the 16 weeks could enter into a 12 month recurring Revenue where the payments just keep going weekly or monthly or you can just resell in another rhythm of 16 weeks I don't when people go into a month-to Monon where it's truly open-ended it's do you want to keep working together in every month you don't know where these clients are staying so having a time commitment is strong but I really having a core recurring Revenue offer that you can just resell and resell and resell again and I am a few years into this with

Revenue where the payments just keep going weekly or monthly or you can just resell in another rhythm of 16 weeks I don't when people go into a month-to Monon where it's truly open-ended it's do you want to keep working together in every month you don't know where these clients are staying so having a time commitment is strong but I really having a core recurring Revenue offer that you can just resell and resell and resell again and I am a few years into this with clients where some clients have never made more than a six-month commitment and they're still here 3 years later so it totally works do it the same way in terms of going from one offer into the next CU by the way just to recap to clarify sorry these are not different offers this is not an upsell this is not a downsell this is a resell would you to continue to pay the same and experience the same level of coaching content and Community yeah that's how I do it I I we're fully on the same page with that and again it goes back to that selling once piece which is to get the transformation you want you know the dream outcome as you say it takes 12 months m in the next 16 weeks these things get done y right so they're committing to 16 weeks but they understand if they want the dream outcome they probably should be there for 12 months minimum y so I sell on two Dimensions the the time Dimensions is you're selling two time frames you're selling what happens first and then what can happen over the time frame but that's a pre it's the dream and the goal yeah right the war and the battle right yeah and then two Dimensions as well is how fast do you want to go mhm because the the the two Dimensions I sell is you can get started here for 300 bucks you get this much of me you get this this this that's enough for 66% of people but based on current numbers for the other 33% who who are in my world they're I want more access to you I want to buy hours with you I want a private sele with you so I have levels yeah that go faster let's talk about the levels well the other level that I'll go back to to the Daily client machine which is a methodology that I launched after Authority architecture that had two really distinct levels which was I'll help you write a book that you can turn into a sales funer they get you high ticket clients that was the whole premise of the daa client machine right the the course and the program of 5 grand the done for you was 50 right right so we' do we'd do the book for them launch the funnel etc etc you wrote people's books I forgot about that you're not just talking about the done for you of the selling it was so another I wanted to introduce that because another level for some people can be Services too yeah one to one services and those things but the the the point is there's power laws present in groups of customers right there is a a pretty decent cohort in most people's audiences who just want more access to you they want to go faster they want it done for them and I believe having an offer there that is multiples of the of the easy to enter $23 $400 a week piece is the fastest way to accelerate Revenue but also understand that there's different there's differing economics in your client base some people I've had people who only ever going to pay me 100 bucks and I've had people going to have pay me multiple six figures y so it's I I believe two Dimensions we're selling two dimensions of time yeah what gets done in terms of what did you say the goal yeah the the dream and the goal the Dream and the goal so sell the goal and then the dream yep and then two dimensions of this is everything that you get there's plenty there but if you want to go if you want to go faster go on the fast lane then then you can
