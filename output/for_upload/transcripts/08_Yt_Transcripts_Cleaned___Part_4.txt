# Yt Transcripts Cleaned - Part 4

you can't go straight from broke to meaning you have to make money right you can't be trying to pay the bills and also trying to impact the world it doesn't work you have to so anyway all that it say things happen in sequence so if we're talking about the foundational things and let's talk about someone's first offer yeah because either they're at 10K a month and they only have one offer and it sucks and it's not scalable or it's not attractive or you're at 50k a month and you've been in the game for a while and you've got 17 offers if someone was to come to you and they're going I want to get to 100K a month in a way that's profitable in a way that scales in a way that I but that clients get results all those things what would be that main offer because it might be we can get into the multiple offers you might have an offer stack or a hybrid offer to get to 100K month but what would be that main offer that you would encourage the average person to build out to lay that Foundation to build a seven figure business so the average person everyone needs momentum but the average person needs momentum the most and the thing that gets the most momentum in an offer is around the refining the promise or refining what gets done what's the outcome of going to be that so if you're if you're selling money which is getting someone to 100K a month Etc you need to say that's our goal and that's what we're going to do M if you're selling time then or you're selling better life then you need to be exquisitly clear about how you articulate what the outcome is on the other side because as soon as you can inject the frame of what's going to happen when that person with that person over the next weeks months maybe year then your offer becomes a lot easier to buy because I think we've both said this recently most people have enough leads if you're at if you're at 10K a month you have enough leads to get to 30k a month you just need a refinement around the promise and what you're doing and in many cases it's refining it down to something making small promises that are much easier to keep rather than making bigger and having promise inflation so I always look around what gets done here in the offer what what are they what are they promising you know and metaphorically in terms of sometimes the literal promise I will get you there we can talk about guarantees but I will get you there and this is where we're going and refining that round so it's much more clear so they they see a bump in conversions because most people have enough leads and if you get the promise right then those leads are more likely to convert and it's much more binary well the promise is interesting because I think people often think that the promise is the deliverables right and Promise vs Guarantee they conflate it with a guarantee which is not the same thing of course so my first coaching offer was 1 hour a week for I don't even think I had a minimum I think it was just 1 hour a week and this is the monthly price and it was if anyone interested it was 600 us a month so it was $150 per hour and that was up from the $13 an hour I was getting paid I was I'm rich right but I had no promise I was just we will meet every week for an hour and I will teach you these things and I didn't even have a lovely system it was more oh you're a real estate agent I'll help you get more listings but again the emphasis was on the deliverables and so the best I would argue you did have a promise and my and my lexicon of promises because you you were promising time and attention in a in a predictable amount you were say I will spend an hour a week with you right right so that's a promise yeah of course it's it's not a promise

these things and I didn't even have a lovely system it was more oh you're a real estate agent I'll help you get more listings but again the emphasis was on the deliverables and so the best I would argue you did have a promise and my and my lexicon of promises because you you were promising time and attention in a in a predictable amount you were say I will spend an hour a week with you right right so that's a promise yeah of course it's it's not a promise to say I'll spend an hour hour a week with you and you're going to be a millionaire by next January but the promise is is largely defined on what they get and that's why one-on-one coaching is easier to sell than group coaching because the promise is more easier to Define I will spend time with you yeah so it's more easier to ATT so so help me understand for a second when Dream Outcome you say promise you talking about dream outcome or you talking about the commitment you're making to someone the commitment you're making to someone okay got you I was more thinking coming up from dream outcome that totally makes sense cuz the best metap for I've heard around that is the you don't sound the play trip you sound the destination and as Elementary as that sounds that help helps you sell $1000 programs and $100,000 Consulting deals right and so when you think about that dream outcome aspect how should people be thinking about it whether it's weight loss whether it's anxiety whether it's money whether it's productivity when people are trying to figure out okay whether it's group or oneto one and we'll get to the details in a second yeah what are some of the key things that you think people should be considering when it comes to a dream outcome let's say they're going to sell a 90day 16 weeks not a yearlong not a multi-year thing not a onh hour Consulting deal but a 3 to four month thing what should they be thinking about when it comes to dream outcomes believability because what an underrated or misunderstood thing in the the high ticket space is a lot of people are trying to convey the authority and the confidence in the person who's delivering it whereas in many cases you need to raise the confidence of the buyer much more than you need to raise the confidence of the seller to deliver the result right so smaller smaller promises are easier to keep and that's theistic I always use with clients of many cases I've seen offers triple in conversion by reducing down the the reduce down the number they go from we'll get you 100 qualified calls a month to we'll get you 10 because that the person on the other side of it the 10 is much more relative to where they are now when they're only getting two right so 100 was the thing that didn't convert because it seems it's in Disneyland where it 10 feel something achievable that's a great example because I get cold DM every day and they're we'll get you20 seems to be the new number do you do the numbers on these if you do sh rate close rate we sell a $5,000 you're helping me get to 500,000 a month for $250 a call or some stupid thing but but this is a great point because the first time I ever realized this I had a client called Brian Mark the fitness guy The Promise amazing human in a SE of helping people get to 10K a month that was the promise of all his contemporaries his promise was you're a personal trainer I will help you make $2 to $5,000 a month as an online fitness coach it worked to the tune of a thousand clients for him paying him I think it was $300 $400 month it was a huge lesson for me because 10K it sounds the more obvious thing whatever the bigger numberers if you can confidently say we're going to get you there then surely the bigger numbers I think it's going to help you make more sales but

his promise was you're a personal trainer I will help you make $2 to $5,000 a month as an online fitness coach it worked to the tune of a thousand clients for him paying him I think it was $300 $400 month it was a huge lesson for me because 10K it sounds the more obvious thing whatever the bigger numberers if you can confidently say we're going to get you there then surely the bigger numbers I think it's going to help you make more sales but he was working with people that primarily made $800 to $1,500 a month selling their time burnt out and what he was selling them was the dream of more money in many cases it was doubling or tripling what they were making but they could have the freedom of making the money in their own way on their own time and it crushed and that was where I was this was maybe 3 years ago I was I don't know if I understand this promise thing as as well as I should yeah yeah it's the people think the promise is relative to their skills but it's relative to the market that you're in right it's relative to where the people are similar David and Craig who coached in person personal trainers in the UK again they tested all the all the different types of messaging 10 grand a month for and when when you're at Â£1,000 a month as your take home income 10,000 is it's on another planet you're in their head they need to become fundamentally a different person and that's terrifying yeah four to five I can see how that happens and there's people me in this in this marketing doing that and I believe it so whenever I'm looking at offer I'm how easy is this promise to keep by the the practition of the person delivering it but how how valuable is it to the person relative right now into the immediate priority because that's the key is is it their current priority or is it a future one because getting someone to a million bucks a year who's on 10K a month that's a future priority getting them to 20K is a is a is a much more pressing current one so if you want a if you want a great offer and and you want conversions now which you need traction and momentum for then making a smaller promise that's relative to the market is going to be get you a lot more traction than a than a than a big promise which is constantly under inflation right well I think about it through the lens of the maso's hierarchy of The Hierarchy of Needs needs right it's you you solve the bottom needs and then you move up in the triangle and so everyone that we work with has survival needs they have it's a painkillers vitamins and bucket lists is it and so you can talk about something on someone's bucket list and that they might go 100% I want that right but are they willing to pull out the credit card and solve it now probably not because it's not the most pressing thing yeah and so an easy example I think about is in 10 Years bro I want to say goodbye to commercial flying right but I get served up ads and get emails for private jets all the time and I'm not right now it's not a survival need it's nice to have and so I think what's really important to think about is everyone has everyone's Perfect Fit prospects has that hierarchy painkillers vitamins bucket lists and so it's not this consistent thing where it's this is a good one and this is a bad one this is a survival need and this is a vitamin every person has those unique things even in different seasons so I remember being burnt out of my mind when we got to 100K a month in our agency and I spent weeks reading books on Sops team operations I hired Alex shaen to help me figure out meetings and culture I couldn't have cared less at six figures about that stuff I didn't even know that was a thing I didn't even I didn't even know

this is a bad one this is a survival need and this is a vitamin every person has those unique things even in different seasons so I remember being burnt out of my mind when we got to 100K a month in our agency and I spent weeks reading books on Sops team operations I hired Alex shaen to help me figure out meetings and culture I couldn't have cared less at six figures about that stuff I didn't even know that was a thing I didn't even I didn't even know what sop meant right and so it just goes to show that through each evolution of my business the survival needs changed so I I think having a dream outcome that's based on a survival need and is believable I think is the really important thing and then making sure that you're not overemphasizing the mechanics the plane trip the seat the air conditioning on the plane but really majoring on that Maui yeah yeah yeah I think I I'm a big proponent of a hybrid offer where you're you're selling once and you're you're selling people into multiple tiers but you're selling them over a long period of time but I still subscribe to the fact of there is a there is a painkiller in the first 8 to 16 weeks of of the engagement in that offer even if you're going to work together for 12 months and the dream outcome is is there you you're still talking about in your Lexicon which I is that that pain killer in the next we're going to remove the biggest pains in your life or your business or your body or whatever it is over the next 8 to 16 weeks and these are the steps we're going to take because that's the that's what they're buying into they're buying into that immediate relief they're buying into that what happens now yeah it's great I'm bought into the the big thing yeah but they're buying into the immediate relief that's what they say yes to that's what they commit to that's what they invest against and then you got to keep them on the track to get the the dream AR here's the key i' be intered to know what you The Dream Outcome think on a practical level so someone's trying to figure out the dream outcome this is this is how I do it yeah you can sit there and brainstorm and dream and open up the journal as much as you want and you might come up with some cool things I just go ask people it's crazy yeah yeah right so it's so so what's really important about this is that people can over complicate this and go but what's my what's the dream outcome I your promise it's firstly you're not the target market this is not for you it's for them that's critical that but right and so it's not what are you most excited about it's what are they most excited about and this is where it comes down to obviously we didn't talk about it but you got to find a person you're passionate about helping and build a business around that person rather than having 27 different possible prospects find a dream Prospect but one of the things I do this is when I I'm launching a lead magnet I'm launching a new offer I'm trying to find an angle I'm trying to find a promise is I just ask people so one of the things that I was exploring three years ago is I was I wonder if I create a program that's around making money but it's around becoming a top 1% coach and that idea lasted for 20 minutes when I DM 10 people and I said hey what do you think of the idea of becoming a top 1% coach and they're lame don't it doesn't connect I was perfect right I was messaging clients and Prospects and anyone else and so when I come with the lead magnet I might come up with three possible lead magnets and then I DM people or I run a poll on my Instagram or I post it on my Facebook Facebook and I say which out of these three

for 20 minutes when I DM 10 people and I said hey what do you think of the idea of becoming a top 1% coach and they're lame don't it doesn't connect I was perfect right I was messaging clients and Prospects and anyone else and so when I come with the lead magnet I might come up with three possible lead magnets and then I DM people or I run a poll on my Instagram or I post it on my Facebook Facebook and I say which out of these three resonates with you the most and I think it's so funny how we can over complicate this the the market research process we're oh we've got to go on Amazon and go on R it and go on all these things and and conduct all this research it's or you could just ask 10 15 20 as many people who will listen to you that are in your target market they could be already paying you or not and just give them some options give them some wording give them some verbage see what relates to them the most you got to pre-bake a few of those cookies right to test them out right I was I was talking to someone recently who had eight closes a sales manager two or three setters I can't remember if hell exists that's what it is exactly exactly right and I and I and I said to them would you be interested in me showing you how to sell the same volume that you're selling now without sales skills right right so I pre-baked their cookie because it's I know I can write an offer that replaces eight sales people yeah with that person cuz they've got an offer converting take all the stuff put it into my myth ology it's great yeah

[ __ ] yeah and then you say if you just don't tell the closes that I'm the one that told you to fire them that would be great and if you could not sh my that's extra that's an extra fee if I have to if I have to but but it's the same thing of pre-baking the pre-baking the idea of just ask them yeah can I take this pain away from you yeah right and so you got to have some hypothesis but you can come up with that in your own research but then you've just got to ask people yeah well this this guy Deja Be a Scientist from Twitter the guy I don't know who how he looks but his name is Ruby and I pay him for Voxer coaching and he has this phrase all the time he he be a scientist so he'll post something about online he's you guys should take more magnesium it's really good for you and everyone's but what brand but how much and he's just go be a scientist figure this out and I think a lot of us have lost that we're looking for the blueprint we're looking for a coach to sit with us and hold her hand and say you should promise this and the reality is is that everyone's Market Niche offer is different you're different and so there are variables at play you need to have a hypothesis and test things out get data and we learn this so well with Facebook ads right everything was a hypothesis you'd be I have a webinar I think will go well so I need to create five ad angles and each ad angle is going to have four different pieces of creative and then the ads manager and the algorithm is going to do its thing to test and see what's going to be the winning race horse we're going to bet on but when it comes to offers when it comes to building out a business we're looking for the best way a through Zed rather than being a scientist and testing these things out getting feedback not getting discouraged and just continuing to iterate and optimize yeah fully and I use the word hypothesis a lot and then a couple of weeks ago someone asked me what it meant and I was what's the and I was it's your best guess ah okay yeah cuz that's what it is you're approaching the market you've got some knowledge you've got some idea and you make your best guess and then you get data on it yeah by asking people running out whatever whatever the next tip is but that is a hypothesis isn't something something complicated it's something it's just simply your best guess and that you're willing you're just willing to be wrong about it I love it so 3 to four month program dream Program Dream Outcome outcome that's believable that's based on market research and based on not what you want but a a perfect fit Prospect survival needs the stuff that they're I'm willing to pay for this right now how would you deliver that because obviously you and I came from the course world right it was you have some modules you have a Facebook Community you have a call once a week that's our way that can still work but if you were to tell someone based on your experience now what they should do or what you would do if you were starting over again how would you structure that first few months so the way I used to do it was onboarding people in a linear fashion which is do this do this do this do this week one week two week three week four have it and it and it goes that what I found was the variables with different people at scale who are joining programs or joining group are very very high right and the more variables you have of the people joining your program the more you have to have infrastructure that caters for those variables so a practical example is the more variables you have the more questions you need and the more customer support you need the more questions you get in your group on your calls etc etc so from an efficiency point of view I found that having a onetoone call with somebody and having and Catering
