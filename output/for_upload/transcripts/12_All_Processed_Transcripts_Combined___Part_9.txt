# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 9

. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Right?, the famous question, this is the bedrock of not everything, but this is the bedrock of having an effortless high velocity business and whatever, domain it is. The semantics around coaching, consulting, and, and mentorship will, go well beyond my, my death. But, I'll be there for the, I'll be there for the discussion. ## Understanding Power Laws in Client Value and Ascension **Summary:** Client value isn't linear; power laws dictate that a small percentage of clients will contribute a disproportionately large amount of revenue. Recognizing and working with these power laws is crucial for maximizing business outcomes. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** I've developed a new way of looking at client value and ascension. And I don't say that lightly, and it was just, again, it was a change of lens. I've been talking about power laws for a very long time because my observation after serving thousands of people and, and, and, and also my career selling hundreds of millions of dollars of product and seeing what happened, what, what the actual behavior behind the scenes was, is that power laws are present in buying and selling in, in, in almost everything. Results are not linear at all. Right? So in our world, all clients are not created equal. The power laws are absolutely everywhere, right? And I can now spot when people are fighting against them because they're taking a linear approach, or whether they're working with them because they're taking a, an approach that looks through the lens of a power law. So we either work with them or we fight against them. The difference between them is very, very stark. And again, this is why I see businesses struggling in markets that are, are valid and effective with valid skills, valid products, etc., because they take a linear approach to the market and see diminishing returns, and then they get exhausted through it. So show me someone who's brute forcing the hours and the effort, and I'll show you someone who is running laps around them with just almost doing nothing. The difference between working with reality or against it is gigantic, right? So when we put a lot of effort into things, that doesn't mean we're going to get a return because it's relative to the, the law that we're operating under. So while a ton, and I've observed this for a long time, a ton of effort in this space goes into signing clients, very little effort goes into considering how much that client wants and needs from you, and what they will ultimately spend. There are just assumptions all the way down because you have a $10,000 offer, then you were looking for $10,000 people. The reality is that 99% of the people in the audience are not $10,000 people, and the 1% of people in the audience might be a hundred thousand dollar people, and you're leaving 90 grand, per unit on the table. So the difference between these things is exponential in the outcome of the, of the business, right? ## Maximizing Client Value through an Ecosystem Approach **Summary:** Instead of focusing on individual sales, build an ecosystem where clients can naturally find their value level. This involves conceptualizing revenue buckets and facilitating client ascension based on their needs and willingness to pay. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So if we have ways and lenses to look at maximizing client value, then the clients will settle in their natural place relative to all the different factors, and timing is a huge one as well. Right, desire to pay, levels of access, how much they value proximity to you or your team, or whatever your setup is, and how fast they ultimately want to go

. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So if we have ways and lenses to look at maximizing client value, then the clients will settle in their natural place relative to all the different factors, and timing is a huge one as well. Right, desire to pay, levels of access, how much they value proximity to you or your team, or whatever your setup is, and how fast they ultimately want to go. So I've started looking at client relationships in the, in the, not in terms of interpersonal relationships, but in terms of value based relationships where a value transfer happens between information and access and money through the lens of annualized value. So that allows us to create an ecosystem. When, after we make the first sale, we put the effort into making it easy to start and easy to get going. Then the client can find their natural place in our ecosystem because we've built it in such a way. So we can do this by conceptualizing revenue buckets that clients can fit into in the process, and that makes filling up these buckets natural. Do not, I think my drawings getting worse, not better. I think, I think I need to take some iPad pills or something, but do not get hung up on the numbers, understand it as a concept, right? And so when we're looking at, when we're looking at revenue buckets, the earlier you are in the journey, and I've put, I've put constraints on this in terms of bounds of a million, 3 million, 6 million. The earlier you are on the journey, the narrower and smaller you want those individual buckets. So we start from, if you're looking at on a scale in the middle. So we have a small number of buckets that we fill up with ultimately with clients. We can do that with a singular offer. We can do that with the hybrid offer plus a couple of things that I'm going to talk about to ultimately fill up those buckets to keep it simple. The, the larger the business and the larger your goals and the larger the scale you achieve, the more you have to expand those buckets. Right? I'm now exploring the outer bounds of this concept where I have clients who, who are exceeding a hundred thousand dollars annualized value, and I am being forced to come up with ways to serve them and the desires and the problems they have. Right? So that is client driven.

right? That is client driven by solving 20 problems along the way to get there. So they had that problem, and then they are now stretching the annualized value that, that they can ultimately achieve, and I can ultimately capture. So the earlier you are in the journey, the less buckets you want, and the smaller and the more concentrated those buckets are because you just want to fill them up. So one or two tiers is, is ultimately optimal, and I'm going to give you examples in a minute to, to show how this plays out in the, in real, the hybrid. Does that, right? So simplicity scales, and the less offers you have, the more that the offer has space to be optimized. ## Growth vs. Scale on the Path to $1 Million **Summary:** On the path to a million-dollar business, prioritize growth through experimentation and iteration. Once you have a proven offer with a high conversion rate, shift to a scale phase focused on volume. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** I've talked again a lot about the difference between growth and scale. On the road to a million dollars a year, which everybody is capable of, then you are spending much more time in growth than scale. Growth is, the metaphor is throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, right? That is how optimization happens. It happens through experiments and action and repeated actions and reps, right? In a growth phase, you never stop moving because you're always learning and iterating and trying to remove the pieces that aren't working. And then once you hit an inflection point of, I have things that work, I have an offer that when I send to people, 30% of people buy it, then you can be in a scale phase where you feed people into that and you're looking for volume. On the, on the journey up, those scale phases don't last for very long until you, you will hit a constraint or a bottleneck of diminishing returns and whether the offer or something needs slight engineering or tweaking to keep, to optimize, to ultimately grow. And those are the points where a lot of people stall out, and you'll hear people saying, "I'm stuck at X revenue. I'm stuck at this." And it's because they haven't switched from a growth phase to a scale phase, or they think they're on a scale phase, but they're in a growth phase, and they need to re-engineer the offers or some of the finances towards the marketplace. ## The Hybrid Offer and Client Value Ascension **Summary:** Use a hybrid offer and a stacked ecosystem to reveal potential ascension paths for clients. This allows clients to naturally find their value level within your ecosystem, leading to higher average client value and retention. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So how does it play out? That, that plays out in a reality that on day one of a relationship with a client, it is difficult to discern, truly discern whether a client is a thousand dollar person or a hundred thousand dollar person. The only way we, we discern that is by showing them the path to do so, right? And then the thousand, thousand, probably in hindsight, it's a bit extreme of an example. You can discern, roughly what bucket they're in, but, if you can't tell between a thousand, a hundred thousand dollar person, then there might not be enough signals to go on. So we use the hybrid offer and the stack, we can show people the potential path forward. So what I have done and what I have experimented with and nailed in my own business, and then helped people apply, is I have very power law based experience because the next step for people is always natural, so that has led to very, very high average client value

. So we use the hybrid offer and the stack, we can show people the potential path forward. So what I have done and what I have experimented with and nailed in my own business, and then helped people apply, is I have very power law based experience because the next step for people is always natural, so that has led to very, very high average client value. And that's also led to very high retention because I have a myth, a methodology which allows people to naturally move forward to the place that they need to be, but also naturally move backwards to settle at a level without them ultimately leaving a community or a product or, etc. And saying in other ways, I've worked out how to get the most amount of money out of clients while delivering, out of clients for delivering the maximum result. And I've also worked out a way to pretty much ensure that most people don't leave because they have something for them. So scenario one, a common scenario: They join the community, they pay in full off the back of, an offer, they enjoy the experience, I credit that experience against the syndicate, and they step up into it. I credit the full experience. I work out a custom payment for them based on the credit, so they're not paying the full amount. They feel that they've got a credit, which is again potential energy in there, and they step up into the syndicate, and they're on a lower payment than they would be at a market rate, and they've got that natural experience. That is a very common flow, just by crediting what someone has previously purchased against the next step. Right? And I'm in the process of engineering that across the board in the business to make that natural. So anybody, no matter how long they've been in there, can benefit from, from that progress in that state, so they can settle in their naturals, in their natural place. That also, this also means that in the inverse, that someone could join the syndicate for a period of time and step back down to the community because under the, the nature of that offer, they might spend 3 months in the syndicate, and then they step down, and they've still got, 9 or 8 months, in the community, and they're still ultimately there and part of it. Right? ## Leveraging Small Initial Investments for High Client Value **Summary:** By strategically structuring your ecosystem and crediting previous purchases, you can transform small initial commitments into significantly higher value client relationships. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So this is another scenario that's played out. And so that, that scenario there has an annualized value of about $20,000 for a person if they stay for the whole duration of that. that's the, the actual ultimate example. Bear in mind, the first touch point that that person had when joining my world was they were probably attracted by someone, something that said, "Join for a hundred dollars." So I have taken that commitment or that interest of a figure around a hundred dollars and then established that the client will spend $20,000, right? There's an order of magnitude different in the actual client value. And this is why we isolate that when we look at offers, we isolate the ability to convert someone versus having an ecosystem that they step into where they ultimately expand. There are plenty of people who have gone through the classic ascension from me, who have downloaded a free lead magnet, bought a $10 book, joined $100 a week community, and then ascended all the way up to the Circle at $800 a week. So again, same scenario, client joins the community, then moves between levels based on how much proximity and access they need at the time. And again, this is a real scenario

. There are plenty of people who have gone through the classic ascension from me, who have downloaded a free lead magnet, bought a $10 book, joined $100 a week community, and then ascended all the way up to the Circle at $800 a week. So again, same scenario, client joins the community, then moves between levels based on how much proximity and access they need at the time. And again, this is a real scenario. One of my one-on-one clients finished this week, and as, dropped back down to a level that we both agree is right from after, a 10 week period of, of one-on-one. So joins the community, goes to the syndicate, goes to the circle, opts for a period of one-on-one, then comes back to the circle, right? So we ultimately have, someone who is worth $51,000 across 52 weeks because we have places to take them and places to go. Two different examples, four people at two different distinct stages. But ultimately, if we look at an ecosystem where we're looking at annualized value, and then our offers naturally fit together, what we stand to do is, is find the maybe half a dozen clients who are currently paying a few hundred or a few thousand dollars and establish that they are, they have a propensity to pay there, of a willingness to pay, and they have a desire for speed or something to be done right now that transforms them into 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or $50,000 relationships. In my experience, in a client, in a, in a cohort of clients, if you've got 10 of them, one of those people is probably prepared to pay a hundred times more than they're currently paying. And so having an ecosystem and understanding that is a dramatic change in the business because the power laws are extreme, absolutely extreme., I'm knocking on the door of 40 people who have contributed half my revenue this year. And if you look at the whole client base, that isn't 80/20, that isn't 90/10. It's somewhere in the region of 94/6 or something that as a power law ratio., 6% of the clients are ultimately contributing half the revenue. It's, it's not even close to linear, right? ## Practical Steps for Implementing an Ecosystem **Summary:** Communicate your various program levels early and often, making them real in your marketing and content. Crediting previous investments towards future purchases injects potential energy into the system, encouraging client ascension. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So in terms of, today's not intended to be too practical, it's, understand the principles behind it. But a practical piece is engineering. This is rooted in displaying the levels early and often. Again, what you've seen me demonstrate is I talk about my client programs a lot. I make them real, and I make them thing, I make them real in my marketing, in my content. I make them real inside the communities, and I make people aware that they ultimately exist. And if I display the levels early and often, it means people have an understanding of the ecosystem and that they can either move upwards and get more access to me, but also move downwards for, at, at different times. So simply, the more I communicate it and the more I talk about the different programs and those things and reference them and, and, and, even talk about them in, in a, in a semi mechanistic way, clients know there are different levels inside, and it makes that upgrade or that downgrade conversation very easy and very natural without any tension and without any fear of losing anything, or fear of being sold to as well

> "I will credit all previous investment that you've got against this next thing,"
, you are writing a check and putting it in their hand, right? Money and credits are potential energy. The, you'll see this happen this month at Christmas time when those people who are impossible to buy for, or children who live miles away from their grandparents, get gift cards. When my kids get gift cards for something, they are stored up potential energy, 
> "I want to go to the shop and spend. I want to go. I want to go. I want to go,"
 right? They have potential spending power that they have been given, and they want to use it. My children are not alone in that. Adults also do that where the potential energy that you can still, that you can give people by giving them a credit for their previous investment is stored up and allows them to use it. Some will use it immediately, and some will store it up well into the future. I have hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential energy stored up across my customer and client base that will just slow, that slowly be deployed. It was deployed yesterday. I credited against a 5K experience. I credited 2,400, and they paid 2,600, right? Potential energy stored up and, and then is utilized, which then creates more cash flow into the business. ## Offer Structure for Different Revenue Goals **Summary:** For a $1 million goal, one offer with two levels and a clear ascension path is sufficient. As revenue goals increase, develop a front-end offer and an inner circle for a larger client base. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** So what do we need? On the way to 1 million, we need one offer with two levels, right? And then if you have, have a, a simple ascension between those two levels, and potentially, extras with that people can purchase hours, or done for you, or anything that as a one-off, then you have everything you need to get to that milestone. As we expand into higher revenue levels, we need a higher, a higher degree of conversion out of the audience. So we need to develop a front-end offer, and we need to develop some inner circle once our client base exceeds 40 to 50 people. Again, I'll talk about the exact things and, and the plan next week that these, this is the principles behind it. ## The Importance of Gratification and Managing Expectations **Summary:** Business growth is not linear, and our tendency towards instant gratification can lead to disappointment and quitting. Manage expectations by focusing on the process and understanding that results are a lag indicator of accumulated behavior. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** I've been thinking a lot, as in over the course of years, about why some people get results and some people don't, and some, and why also the phenomena of people who get results quit along the way because they're dissatisfied with the result they're getting. And it all came back to that, the idea of gratification and in the course of doing things, in the course of executing on something or working on something, and the more obsessed you are with something, the more you value the return from it, and you need feedback from it. And again, the map is, is not the terrain. The math of achieving different revenue levels is easy to write down. Right? I can, I can put math on a page and point to that and go,
