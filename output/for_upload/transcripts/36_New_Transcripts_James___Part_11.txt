# New Transcripts James - Part 11

. It just felt so real, which is a hundred percent true. I just ranted for 18 minutes. The second thing was, is that he said it really spoke to him because it felt I was just sharing the experience that I'd been through. And so I think it's so important to think counterintuitively to how you think the, the thing should look right. We think an ad we psychologically go into, I'm writing an ad, I'm trying to be incredibly persuasive. We lose all the rawness, the, the conversational tone, the authenticity, the best ads do not feel ads. So my best performing ads right now are just boosted content that's worked, that worked organically. And I don't change anything for the ad. I just boost it. And my VSL has gone from slides pretty polished to now just me ranting at a camera for 18 minutes and it's converting even better. So I think I, I know I interrupt your flow, James, but I just wanna speak to that. 'cause I think your ad strategy makes no sense to me as someone who spent millions on ads. And it makes every bit of sense to me as someone who's realized the counterintuitive nature of what works and what appeals when everyone zigs you zag. And I think that's a very powerful tool to increase conversions. Oh, just as, just to close the humor of about how bad the ads are, the other highest converting ad is a screenshot of the landing page is the image of the ad. It's not fair, but it works. Yeah. The, the where, where I can see me ending up this year is not creating anything for marketing that the, the tools will just package up all the creating I do every single week. Right., the, and I'm doing more proactive with that. on the circle call on Tuesday, we talked about positioning and I went through the five pillars, right. And then I clipped the first 12 minutes of that video out and then put it out there as a video. Mm hmm. That's not marketing, that's just stuff I already made distribution. Yeah. And so I think AI tools as well are amazing for this because it can just, it can speed up our distribution. Mm-hmm. And if we speed up our distribution, then we end up making, getting in front of more people and making more offers. Yeah. So especially as, as, if you coach, if you mentor, if you consult, if you're, you are making so much stuff in any given week. Yeah. You are making hours of content just by talking to people., we are making things right now. Right. We can dump this into Opus clip and have weird and random clips that are gonna show up on the internet in the next few days. Yeah. But the, the, and I try to get, I try to get my, my folks to think about asset creation., yeah, you are making a product, you're making a Google Doc, you're writing this thing, you're making it for a client., you might be making it for one person, but that's an asset. So what, yeah. What can you create from that? What can you create from that? Yeah. So the leverage available to us now is just absurd. Yeah. Now that we can close the gap with that. Yeah. And the, we are making so much stuff. Even if you are not, even if you don't have that many clients right now, even if you are, you are making hours of stuff right now. Yeah. A hundred percent., one of the last things I wanna finish up with is on messaging and content and sharpening your content. Mm. I think the best content reads, you are walking through someone's day. So I'll give you an example

. Yeah. And the, we are making so much stuff. Even if you are not, even if you don't have that many clients right now, even if you are, you are making hours of stuff right now. Yeah. A hundred percent., one of the last things I wanna finish up with is on messaging and content and sharpening your content. Mm. I think the best content reads, you are walking through someone's day. So I'll give you an example. When we say things, and I want everyone to think about their own offer and their own niche here for a second, oftentimes we we generalize people's struggles, which dehumanizes their experience. I'm gonna say that again. Oftentimes we generalize people's struggles, which means we de human their dehumanize their experience. So what that looks is, if, if we are working in a market where someone is not getting leads, what do we say, ah, you're struggling to get leads, but what does that practically look for them? If you were to, as the old marketing quote says, enter into the conversation happening in their minds, then maybe you might say something, you wake up on Monday to another week of no sales calls booked. And I've just come up, I came up with this framework a few weeks, a few days ago, sorry, of this idea of surface signals that, that it, it's not the problem, but it's the symptom. And when you can articulate the symptom really, really well, if you can articulate it well enough, people will assume how to solve it. Sam Ovens was world class at this. Someone asked him, how is it that your funnel, your webinar has made $50 million? And he said, it's because I know exactly what happens in my ideal client's day from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to sleep. And so when you think about your ideal clients, and I've been really workshopping this through all of my messaging through sales pages, VSL, offer doc, do not generalize where you can get specific. So don't say, not getting enough leads or, you're not sell, you're not getting enough clients. It's, you just got, you just got back from a sales conversation and you've got another, you got another, let me think about it. Right? That's real. People can feel that. Or you've been checking Stripe a crack addict and still nothing's coming through. You're trying to find that visceral sense of emotion where people feel seen. And then on the flip side, what is the transformation that you offer? What does that look on the other side? Well, you wake up on Monday with, with three to five calendar, three to five sales calls already booked on your calendar with dream prospects. So instead of just saying, we go from no leads to leads, from no calls to calls, you try and, make it more specific, make it more real. And I, I've just observed for this, when, when I really focus in on this, people think that I'm speaking directly to them, right? When, when I was a preacher and we would speak on stage, the best compliment you could ever get is someone says, man, it felt, it felt you're speaking just to me. And the best content creates that connection. And so just this idea of pain signals, what are the signals and the symptoms that they're experiencing, how does that show up in their life that shows that they're stuck or misaligned or not where they wanna be? Right? Then dream signals. What are the things they want to feel? What do they want their calendar to look ? What do they want their life to feel ? And the more specific you can get it, when you disappear from the, the general, you're not losing weight

. What are the things they want to feel? What do they want their calendar to look ? What do they want their life to feel ? And the more specific you can get it, when you disappear from the, the general, you're not losing weight. It's while you're standing in your, your pantry at 11:00 PM eating another midnight snack, you told yourself you were never gonna eat again. Right? The more visceral and emotional you can connect with people through that way, the easier it is to make money. Because people go, oh, oh, my situation A hundred percent. And to, to add to that, the closer to the event, the, the closer the event happens to the content, the better. So I joke that, the best posts are written on the toilet, which is, I'll have a conversation in here with someone and I get an insight or something will happen, and then I'll go next door and write the post. Right? The this, if you find something, you have an insight and the speed with which it happens and the speed that you can tell the story back, it feels more real and relevant 'cause it's happened in real time. And social media has also trained people to think in 24 hour cycles. 'cause all the content disappears after 24 hours in most cases, right? So the, the, when something good happens to a client, or when you get an insight or when something happens to you with the story, the speed with which you transfer that event into telling the story about that event and giving it, you give it much more physical place., I was on, I was on Zoom with a client today and he told me about this. And I, and I, and I, and I decided this, the faster you can close the gap between something happening that's worth talking about, and you talking about it in terms of content, the more alive that content feels, it feels more real, more fresh, more relevant because it just happened. And we are tuned into things that are just happening. Now, if you try to tell stories of, yeah, one year ago my clients act did this, it's, it doesn't feel as relevant. Ency is Huge, but it doesn't feel as relevant. So if you can close the gap between insight interesting and into, into creation, your content will feel more alive and more people will follow you because you are in motion and you're proving that you are in motion by demonstrating that you are doing something all the time in real time and taking people somewhere Completely. I think that's huge., how are you doing for time, dude? I know we've gone 90 minutes. Do you have a few minutes to answer questions or we need to go? Yeah, yeah., I got Cool. Got absolutely nothing to do. So firstly I would just love, yeah, me neither. I've got nothing on the rest of the day., I'm gonna go to the sauna and the cold plunge at some point., I'm gonna go to your, I'm gonna go to your sauna later as well. Oh, Amazing., so I would love everyone to just take stop for a second. We've obviously covered a lot, a lot of ground. This isn't your typical teachy workshop, but my hope is there's been an aha, a shift, a takeaway. I would just love for you to just drop it in the chat. what, what's been a shift, an aha, an insightful moment that you feel, okay, I needed to hear this today. If I take one thing from this call, that's the only thing that I need. Just drop that in the chat and then we'll shift towards questions., obviously there'll be certain questions that will be so in depth or require so much more context

. I would just love for you to just drop it in the chat. what, what's been a shift, an aha, an insightful moment that you feel, okay, I needed to hear this today. If I take one thing from this call, that's the only thing that I need. Just drop that in the chat and then we'll shift towards questions., obviously there'll be certain questions that will be so in depth or require so much more context. We might not need to, I might not be able to get to them., but if there's any questions, especially on some of the stuff that we've talked about, or maybe other things you think relate to this format and this style, then by all means you can ask that. So either drop an insight or a takeaway or a question in the chat and we can hang around for a few minutes. Thi this is a, probably a good question. There's a lot of context here, but this whole, how do I break through my imagined 40 KA month limit to a hundred K month limit?, I'm just, I I'm gonna, I, I've already answered that one, about a week ago, but I'm gonna, we'll, we'll tap in. I, I, I, I I'll, He's, he's clearly asking, asking for my one. He's clearly asking for me then. Yeah, yeah, Exactly., no, so let me just quickly get the context on here. 32 KA month have two tiers. One to one is with 300 a week group is 4, 4, 4 a month., imagining in my mind, 40 k month being a limit is I have so only much capacity at people. So only have so much capacity at one-to-one. People love the one-to-one offers as . Where do you find people break through to, let's say, 78 KA month when they're in near capacity at three to 30 to 40? Firstly, some, some capacities are completely imagined, right?, the question you have to really think through is, number one, what does one-to-one look right now? What are the constraints? So for example, for me, when I was, in 2023, I, I was doing $95,000 a month in profit with one-to-one, and it was two 30 minute calls a month with 30 clients. So I was making great money in seven and a half hours of delivery a week. Time wise, I technically had capacity for way more than that., why couldn't I do 60 clients and make double the money? Well, the first constraint was energetic. It was, yeah, I could technically fill my calendar with more people, but that sounded hell to me. So one of the things I did when I really got sick of servicing people one-to-one via call is I moved everyone to Slack and then we had almost no calls and we just did everything through Slack. And all of a sudden this, this sacred cow of this is what one-to-one needs to look was killed because I retained everyone and people got, great results. And I was, oh, this is very interesting. So the first thing you wanna look at is what artificial constraints am I creating for myself by thinking it needs to be done this way? Right? When, when I first got started with one to one coaching, I was doing one one hour session a week, and then I worked with Hormoz in 2021 and we did two 30 minute calls a month. And I was, well, this was effective. I'm gonna try that. The second thing is, price point is huge, right? So, if you hit capacity, that's a great moment to hike your prices either with existing clients or with, new clients coming in

. And I was, well, this was effective. I'm gonna try that. The second thing is, price point is huge, right? So, if you hit capacity, that's a great moment to hike your prices either with existing clients or with, new clients coming in., I was talking to one of my friends the other day who said that she, she's a stick and poke tattoo artist and she's based in LA and she's at capacity and can't make more money. And so I was, well, if you doubled your prices and half your schedule, you would make the same amount of money but work half as hard. But even if you didn't go as aggressive as that, right, there's probably capacity for you to appeal to a higher level person. And so pricing is obviously not, in a vacuum. You can't just raise prices exponentially. The thing that I would say is that, is there a comfortable bump where you can do 10% or 20% and test and see how that feels. The second thing is what positioning would you need for people to perceive a higher value through your one to one coaching so that it's worth charging more? But honestly, the key thing is, is that, Jay, I know you're on the call right now. Do you just wanna drop in the chat right now? Are you bumping up against the capacity or are you perceiving the capacity as there? I'll, I'll add, I'll add to this insight as well. One to one can be productized just everything else. And one of the base assumptions of one-to-one is that it's blank slate custom, that you are reactive and responsive to the person on the other side rather than directional. And so one of the, one of the scaling challenges in the, in Jay's current format with one-to-one is it's personalized output. There's a message, there's a custom message going to each person multiple times a week when that can be productized, which is these messages goes the, to these clients privately on the, on this schedule. So yeah, Some, a lot of people get stuck in one-to-one because they believe it's custom for everybody rather than directional with higher levels of access for feedback and response. So you can course correct. Yep. So it still needs a path because that's what gives it scale. The scale is we're all running on this journey, but we have higher levels of access to modify the journey as we go along. So one to one is just as, productizes everything else because you're setting the path, but you are, you are allowing higher levels of feedback and access so you can course correct. Yep. Also, there's a greater principle in here for everyone on the call, which is you get what you settle for. And so if right now the banks of the river are so clearly pointing towards a low friction price with a desirable outcome of working one-to-one with you, and you want to, to have the river flow into, your scalable offer, which is obviously it solves a lot of this, you, number one, how do I make the scalable offer more appealing from a, a value perception standpoint? Number two, how do I increase the price to where there is really clear value discrepancy between the two? So for your ideal clients, it's not, oh, I'll just do one-to-one. It's, some people can't afford it. And number three, there's so many different ways that you can pull the lever to where you don't even offer that. At the same time, always, if you're trying to incentivize the group, I got to capacity with one-to-one really fast in 2023, and there was no lack of people who wanted to work with me one-to-one, but my capacity was full

. It's, some people can't afford it. And number three, there's so many different ways that you can pull the lever to where you don't even offer that. At the same time, always, if you're trying to incentivize the group, I got to capacity with one-to-one really fast in 2023, and there was no lack of people who wanted to work with me one-to-one, but my capacity was full. And then in June of 2023, I launched a group offer and I had 35 people join at $1,200 a month in the first 30 days. Would most of those people want to, if they could afford to work with me, one-to-one, a hundred percent. It's just that that wasn't available. So I made the proximity level that I had capacity for available, and then that was the main way that I grew in 2023, as I just kept adding people into that community. And so sometimes we become the makers of our own prison. It's, oh my gosh, I'm at capacity with one-to-one. Everyone wants one-to-one. And the answer is, you can fix that by making group more appealing, creating a, a bigger price gap, and then really making sure that in your marketing you are subtly positioning or maybe not so subtly positioning the offer that you want to sell more of. One, one of the, one of the, one of the more obvious symptoms in, in terms of capacity for for most people is conversion rates, right? People trumpet about high conversion rates where they're a counter signal to capacity. Yeah. If you've got maybe in pricing conversion rate, you've got massive elasticity in terms of pricing and you don't want high conversion rates long term. Yeah. You, you want, you want majority nos not majority yeses. Yeah. But a lot of people optimize for majority yeses. So if you are converting at 80%, you, you, you don't need to directly invert it, but, yeah. 35 percent's healthy because most, heuristically, most people should be saying no. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why people brag about that. It's so funny. Well, 'cause it feels good. No, no, no. But I'm saying it, I'll give you an example. There's an anecdote that's gonna sound a big brag name drop, but this is just what's gonna mind for me. I was in Las Vegas in 2021 with a client called Andrew Scott, amazing human who coaches restaurants. And, we are at this, kind of semi private plane terminal thing. Very affordable, semi private thing in, in America called JSX, Very affordable, semi private, Not, well, what was crazy is, it's a 30 person jet and it was $300, $400 one way. So really, it's not crazy. But when we got there, the Hormo was there and then, our flight got delayed. So long story short, so, catch up with Alex and Layla, 'cause I knew them from Zoom and stuff. And our, this guy was Fanboying. One of my client was fanboy, losing his mind. So he was not even sitting with us. And then eventually he came and sat with us and, they're asking questions and at some point he slips in, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I have 80% conversion rates. And without skipping a beat, hormo goes, oh my gosh, that's horrible. And the guy's really taking aback and he is, oh man, you charge way too little. And it was such a powerful moment seeing the penny drop for my client in such an abrupt way of, oh wow. Yeah. What am I doing? This is crazy. And I think that's a real, pricing
