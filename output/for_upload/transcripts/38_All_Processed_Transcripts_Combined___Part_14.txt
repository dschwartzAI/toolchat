# All Processed Transcripts Combined - Part 14

. ## The Importance of Practice and Distilling Success Factors **Summary:** James Kemp acknowledges the difficulty of teaching content creation due to his own unconscious competence. He emphasizes the importance of practice and aims to distill his success factors into actionable steps for his audience. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** I will admit something: this is very difficult for me to teach because I've been doing it for so long. I understand how much unconscious competence I have in writing and communicating. And so a lot of the things that come through just come through. So I have to work really hard to break these down into something that's digestible for you, and actionable as well, because so much of my ability to communicate is just purely reps and practice. But these are the, this is the distillation of that, so you can replicate those. And then at the end, I'm going to give you the ability to replicate those. ## Creating Content that Delivers Insight **Summary:** James Kemp stresses the importance of delivering insight rather than just information. He explains that insight provides the "why" behind the "what," demonstrating a deeper understanding that attracts clients seeking replicable success. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** We have to embrace some factors. These are the things that differentiate just noise and information in a marketplace from actual content that derives context to move someone forward. We're talking about content that does something, not just words on a screen and something to kill time. We want to move something in somebody, and we've got to do that through different factors. The first one is, we've got to deliver insight, because information is everywhere, but delivering insight is relatively rare. The distinction between those is, information allows us to observe what is happening, while insight gives us some reasons why; it tells us why. So if you can demonstrate insight, you are demonstrating understanding of why something is happening via content. And then you are demonstrating a deeper understanding that others seek. It's all very well to tell somebody about something happening, or this client got this result. It's another level to deliver an insight about how that result happened and why it happened for this person, so those conditions can be replicated, and that gives the ability for you to work with somebody. Because if success is present, then you give an insight about why that success happened, and then that insight's delivered and they say, "Hey, maybe that works for me." The selling of ideas is what content does. Content doesn't sell offers, because before someone can buy something, they need to buy into something. ## Content as an Idea Salesperson **Summary:** James Kemp positions content as an "idea salesperson," emphasizing that selling ideas leads to easier product sales. He advocates for selling the concept before the product, avoiding constant selling that can create audience fatigue. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** And that something is an idea. So if you sell people on your ideas, it's much easier to sell them on you, on working with you, and sell them on your products. If they are sold on the idea by the time you get to an offer or a product, then it's much more natural for them to buy that because it's a resolution of ideas and insights that have been delivered via content. So I approach content as an idea salesperson. As, I don't do sales calls. I don't do selling on a large degree. I just sell ideas and then allow people to buy into them. And then I have products that allow people to fulfill on those ideas. So I approach content as an idea salesperson, and doing that sells a hell of a lot more product, and also in a much more frictionless way than approaching content to sell a product. You'll see this when someone is constantly selling in their content, that it generates fatigue

. I don't do selling on a large degree. I just sell ideas and then allow people to buy into them. And then I have products that allow people to fulfill on those ideas. So I approach content as an idea salesperson, and doing that sells a hell of a lot more product, and also in a much more frictionless way than approaching content to sell a product. You'll see this when someone is constantly selling in their content, that it generates fatigue. But if you're constantly selling ideas, it generates insight and much more desire for the products you have on the other side of it. ## Living a Great Life for Great Content **Summary:** James Kemp asserts that interesting content stems from an interesting life. He encourages documenting experiences and applying the principles he teaches to create compelling content that resonates with the audience. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** Here's a reality, and I'm going to give you a few realities in the creation of content: If your life is boring, your content is boring. If you don't do anything, then you have nothing to talk about. You just have nothing really to say that's of any interest. And to deliver insight, if you don't do anything, there is nothing to say, because content is an amplification of your own life and the characters in it. The simplest way to have great content is to live a great life. You do not need lots of hooks and angles and constantly coming up with ideas. If you just live a good life, and you be and do and document that along the way, and if you layer over what I'm going to show you today, then those things are a powerful driver for being interesting, to get people interested. And then sell the ideas through the telling of those stories and the documentation of that life. ## Avoiding Authority Destroying Content Practices **Summary:** James Kemp outlines three content practices that erode authority: criticizing others, asking the audience what they want, and publicly complaining about private matters. He advises against these to maintain credibility. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** You will see a lot of different approaches to how people communicate and content, and you will see all these things show up, and I believe, and I have assessed them as destructive. It can take a long time to build authority, but it can be very, very quick to destroy. So you will destroy authority if you consistently, or even sometimes randomly, criticize others, specifically or directly. You will also destroy authority if you ask your audience what they want to see, what content they want you to create, etc., because leaders don't ask what content and what people need, they just lead them. And you will also destroy authority subtly if you, there's a common thing in people's content where they criticize DMs they got, or they criticize cold outreach, or they criticize things that are happening to them, and they complain about it in public, and they take private things into public, which erodes authority. So if you criticize others directly, if you ask your audience, or if you complain excessively about different DMs, different trends – and I think a lot of people have one-shot their whole audience by an election that happened last year – you destroy your authority and credibility in the eyes of your audience, because people want to see something from you, and it's not complaining, and it's generally not negative. ## The Myth of the "Best" Content Platform **Summary:** James Kemp debunks the idea of a single "best" platform for content, arguing that trust and attention can be built anywhere. He recommends creating content for one platform and then distributing it to others, prioritizing consistent creation over platform choice. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** One of the worst ideas that has proliferated is that there is a "best" platform. There is no such thing as a best platform to publish content on

. He recommends creating content for one platform and then distributing it to others, prioritizing consistent creation over platform choice. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** One of the worst ideas that has proliferated is that there is a "best" platform. There is no such thing as a best platform to publish content on. This stops more people than it starts because it causes people to scatter focus. And there's some very convincing people out there who will market their version of content creation. They will say that LinkedIn is the best platform, some will say that YouTube is the best platform, someone else will say… right? All those people have an incentive to say that because they're selling that. But the reality is trust and attention can be built anywhere. Social networks have humans on them. Right now in my client group, I can point to people who are crushing it on different platforms in different ways with different content. But they've all got the same theme, which comes through in what you're going to see today. There is a formula that works for all this stuff that will continue to work, which is, create for one platform and then distribute it to other platforms. My whole content strategy is copy-paste, but it starts from the creation. The best platform for you is one that you can create consistently on. ## Choosing the Right Content Platform for Consistent Creation **Summary:** James Kemp advises choosing a content platform based on individual strengths and the ability to create consistently. He suggests text-based platforms for writers and video platforms for charismatic communicators, emphasizing consistent messaging over platform selection. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** It is very easy for me to wake up every day and write one or two emails. What is easy for you may differ. That could be one or two videos, that could be one or two tweets, that could be one or two Instagram pictures, reels, or anything in between. The best platform is the one that you can create consistently on, or you have created consistently on. And this requires some discernment. If you're a writer and you have a face for radio, then Facebook and LinkedIn, which are text-based platforms, would easily fit into your wheelhouse. If you're great on video and you're charismatic and you're a great communicator, then Instagram or YouTube, and copy and paste those same ideas to Facebook and LinkedIn. But you're creating for a primary platform. Your message and the consistency of sharing it matter far more than choosing the right platform. My primary channel is email, then I distribute content across multiple platforms. If I record something on video, which is another content medium, it's based off something I've already written, and that's in almost all cases. The idea is seeded in writing, and then the video is created because I can create in another medium. So I take a create-first stance because the message is the most important thing, and distribute second. ## A Copy Paste Content Strategy **Summary:** James Kemp illustrates his copy-paste content strategy, starting with email as his primary platform and then distributing the same content to other platforms Facebook and Instagram. He emphasizes the importance of a strong origin point for the content. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** So here's an example of an email I wrote that happened to have an image of us in it. So I start with the email. I then initiate my complicated strategy of copying and pasting, and then I put that on Facebook, and then I put that on Instagram. Same thing distributed across probably more platforms, that probably went on LinkedIn as well. But the origin point is telling the story and has the characteristics that need to be in it. ## Vulnerability in Content Creation **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the necessity of vulnerability in content creation, suggesting that those unwilling to share personal elements should focus on paid advertising instead. He explains that this vulnerability is a trade-off for gaining attention and building trust

But the origin point is telling the story and has the characteristics that need to be in it. ## Vulnerability in Content Creation **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the necessity of vulnerability in content creation, suggesting that those unwilling to share personal elements should focus on paid advertising instead. He explains that this vulnerability is a trade-off for gaining attention and building trust. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** With content, the world has changed. People, we are in a low-trust environment, and people want to see the what, and who, and how, and the whys behind it. And to do this we need a dose of vulnerability. The dose matters for the person. My vulnerability and your vulnerability are going to differ, but at a simple level, if you are unprepared to put yourself out there, even a tiny, tiny little bit, you have no business trying to create content. You'll be met with constant frustration and constant friction. If you are not prepared to communicate and tell stories that have some layer of personal elements in them, you're better off not even starting. If that is you, you need to focus on paid acquisition and buying customers through direct means. You need to go to the bank, spend money on Meta or Google, or one of the many other platforms, but they're the primary ones, to go and buy customers. But the skill levels required to do that are significantly more than posting and creating content. Content is the most democratized version of leverage. So if you don't want to deploy any of that, you need to go and buy attention. If you want to get attention through content, then your ideas and the life, and even the life of the people around you, are going to be subject to some level of scrutiny. This is the trade-off. In exchange for attention, we have to put ourselves out there, even a tiny, tiny, tiny little bit. ## Authenticity and the Online Persona **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the concept of the online persona, advising against creating a drastically fictitious version of oneself. He emphasizes that sharing content closer to one's true self fosters trust and makes content creation more sustainable. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** In the world of the internet, everything is an amplification, or even a distortion, of reality. Everybody plays a character on the internet, just everybody plays some character on a group call versus a personal conversation, etc. So the art of doing this consistently is not playing too much of a character, because everybody's doing it. The person on the internet that you communicate through is a small or large synthetic version of the real you. The longer you play a character and get too far away from yourself, the harder it is to maintain. An actor can't act 24/7 without losing themselves. So if you create this massively fictitious version of you that's not real, then that is very, very hard to sustain. Ask me how I know. So the closer what you share is to the real you, the more it flows. All the things I write about are documentation of my life. It's very simple for me to create content because I'm just sharing what I do and how I do it, and all the things in between, and what happens to me and the people inside my world. So the more your content flows from you because it's you, the more people see you, and the more people trust you. People have a wonderful bullshit detector, and if they sense that you're creating this outlandish version of yourself, or you're twisting the truth too much in the form of making content, then they will not trust you, and they will not buy from you. If you choose to lean in, then you'll be richly rewarded if that is what you seek

. So the more your content flows from you because it's you, the more people see you, and the more people trust you. People have a wonderful bullshit detector, and if they sense that you're creating this outlandish version of yourself, or you're twisting the truth too much in the form of making content, then they will not trust you, and they will not buy from you. If you choose to lean in, then you'll be richly rewarded if that is what you seek. And often people will engage with the stuff the most that you, in some cases, don't want them to engage with. I don't particularly want to call myself an idiot on the internet and post a slightly stupid photo. I do it because it's a great way to communicate, and I do it because it's effective. And people love it. They engage with that stuff because it is a variation of me, because that's what I am, and that's how I'd speak. ## The Power of Recency and Momentum in Content Creation **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for capitalizing on recent insights and stories, explaining that the freshness of an idea transmits energy and resonates more effectively than reusing or repurposing older content. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** My best posts are written on the toilet, and that is a product of recency and momentum. I had a ton of calls on Tuesday, and I sat at this desk being there and present and delivering for the people I was speaking to on Tuesday. And then I got insights and ideas and those things when I stepped away from that, and I jotted those down, and I'm writing about those right now. The energy of recent insights and stories always lands over a planned strategy. The freshness of an idea or a story comes through in real time. There's some magic in what is in the air. Every time I reuse content, it loses a little bit of energy. So content has a half-life. It starts to degrade over time. But it's relatively short. It's, down nowadays. It used to be measured in decades, and then it was measured in years, and now it's measured in months. So creating insights based on just very recent events transmits motion and movement. There's a big difference to telling a story about what happened to a client a year ago to telling a story about what happened to a client yesterday. There's some aliveness and some recency that put more weight into that content that makes it much more digestible and real, and obviously gets a lot more motion and behavior. So people follow emotion and movement. I give the example of the YouTuber, Casey Neistat. He was always moving around in his videos. He blew up because he had a character in the background, which was New York City, and then he was always moving. He was always on a booster board, he was in this office, and it had places, and he was always in motion. And things that are in motion are very easy to follow. So if you're in motion and you're doing things, and you document along the way, and you create the content as you go, you have this potent essence in that content where there's something to follow, and there's something to do, and people follow along. ## Speed to Message and Content Potency **Summary:** James Kemp highlights the importance of quickly creating content after gaining an insight. He explains that this speed transmits a potent energy and makes the content more compelling and alive for the audience. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** And so speed to message matters. If you give an insight or you get an insight, and then you create the content quickly off the back of that, then that content will be very, very potent. So Brad was in my house

Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** And so speed to message matters. If you give an insight or you get an insight, and then you create the content quickly off the back of that, then that content will be very, very potent. So Brad was in my house. He came here for a VIP, we spent a day writing on the, with the dogs writing on the window, putting out a plan for him for the next year. It was about 800,000, he wanted to go to a million, and he wanted to crack that number. So I documented the day, I talked about what happened, I took a couple of pictures, and I gave some insights about what plan he was undertaking, what he was doing. So when I'm reporting that in real time, it gives the content some potency and aliveness. ## The Importance of Context in Content Creation **Summary:** James Kemp explains that content needs a superstructure and scaffolding, emphasizing the crucial role of context. He argues that content without context is just noise and advises inserting mechanisms, identity, and world into content to create meaning. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** Before you make content, you need a superstructure. You need some scaffolding. And what is absent in most content is context. So content that doesn't create context is just noise. And God forgive me, most of you are just creating a lot of noise because you're not creating context. And you just need these small elements in your content to create that context. So when we are creating content, we must insert context to move people towards our ideas. And we do this by putting in our mechanisms, the identity that we are helping people unfold, and the world that we live in, into our content. So when we link our unique mechanisms with a problem someone is currently facing, it gives them context. This is the problem that Bob was facing. This is the mechanism he used to solve that. There is a mechanism to solve that problem, and it's possessed by Ryan, or Michael, or Jared. We link our aspirational identity to a demonstration of our philosophy, and during that we create context. When people are looking at content or marketing, they tend to look forward. They don't say, "What offer am I making?" They say, "What ad do I need to run?" They don't say, "What's the context and content inside my offer?" They say, "What content do I need to create?" We need to work backwards towards the market. So we define the mechanisms we make offers with, and we create content around those mechanisms. ## Content, Mechanisms, and Context: A Real-World Example **Summary:** James Kemp provides a real-world example of how he uses mechanisms to create context in his content. He discusses specific mechanisms used within his programs and how he consistently incorporates them into his content across various platforms. Video Source:* source: ContentCode.txt **Content:** Here's a living, breathing example. Inside the syndicate, the circle, and the membership, we do three pretty simple things: we create a hybrid offer that people can buy off a Google Doc, we run workshops that we sell tickets to, and we turn those customers into clients, and we generate leads with the daily client machine. So inside our world, we do and build those things. Inside our workshops, we give more context to those things. How do you create a hybrid offer? So we show, we have a look behind the curtain. In the content that I create, I will be speaking about the mechanisms over and over again. I will be talking about the hybrid offer over and over again, and inserting it into one of my content types
