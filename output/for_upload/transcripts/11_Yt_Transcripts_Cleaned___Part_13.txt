[ __ ] that yeah but it was okay this business thing can be really simple you can just have something that people want so I started a finance company but the I got a consumer credit license in the UK and I went door-to-door and I sold photography packages right and low income areas so I would knock on a door and I'd sell them a photography package for 200 quid right and then they'd pay it off interest free over 20 weeks yeah 10 pounds a week and then after four weeks I could go and sell that to a finance company who'd pay me more than the face value of everything and I made a couple hundred quid off each one yeah and I was this is good this is good and then but look quick pause was it good in the sense of how did you find the work part of it you're knocking on doors selling photography was that was a brutally hard season of learning the skills and having doors shut in your face see I didn't and even in hindsight I didn't right because when I was at school all my friends were going to work at the mall to do present wrapping and work at the body shop in the warehouse over Christmas right when we're 14 15 and I was screw that you get five bucks an hour right and I went to do work in a galvanizing Factory for 20 bucks an hour look we're stacking magazines so I was always where's the highest yield I didn't I never minded the work yeah so I think going forward into knocking on door sucks right because the the level of rejection and danger you get yeah is ridiculous but I never even in hindsight and maybe I've romanticized it because I've told the story many times yeah even in hindsight I didn't find it difficult I found it interesting because I love I love creating something and offering it someone else and and then learning and tweaking along the way and that's been the consistent path through there yeah right so you're so you're selling these doing the stuff door-to-door yeah and then where did it go from there so I learned WordPress and I learned SEO because the the guys I was selling my leads to they were we're doing online leads yeah so I self-taught myself WordPress and I self-taught myself SEO and I started dabbling with Google ads right so I started generating leads online so I could get an online lead for six or seven pounds and sell it for 50 Quid to these they're they're called kneecap finance companies they're dot they trap people and it which I look back in hindsight and go yeah the moral wait a minute the moral things and that's what made me end it yeah because I was I saw someone say if you can't imagine being in this business in five years why are you even in it today yeah but and correspondingly at the same time I got done and I had a 70 000 pound in bill that I owed on ads and all these things for leads that I couldn't sell to them because they all went out of business and the financial crisis oh okay so that was around the time in 2008 2009 so in the space of a couple of weeks all my customers went out of business and stopped paying me the financial crisis hit and found out we're pregnant with our first child what was that period of your life again as a marketer probably romanticized it so it's even it's even more difficult yeah yeah that was

[ __ ] stressful it was unbelievably stressful but it's in those moments where you're what do I really want to do who do I really want to be and was that clear to you at that time or is that something that was evolving no not at all I think in hindsight the North Star has always been the tinkering piece making something putting it out there I was always a top performer in sales because I'd always be interested in the person an interest in the psychology of what I was saying what was coming across the dynamic the relationship and those things and I think the next thing that I did I was sitting at home one night watching everything crumble and I emailed a startup in London called living social so Groupon and living social have both come onto the market a daily deals market and then just exploded into this thing because local businesses could use them to get customers which is notoriously difficult right and I emailed the general manager who they'd come to London they had about four or five people and he said can you be in central London at eight o'clock the next morning it's yeah it was a response that do an email at 11 o'clock at night got there got the job on the spot and then 16 months later there were 350 people they've been funded with 800 Million by Amazon I was in the middle of another thing which was all about making lots of offers right and and but in the online space this is fascinating because I don't even know this stuff I know I know the New Zealand Origins yeah I didn't quite know the UK stuff and so at this time was I'm fascinated because most entrepreneurs have the story of I was born an entrepreneur I was unemployable I kept getting fired from places that doesn't seem it's your story I'm sure there were moments of this is hard I would rather be doing my own thing but were apart from the tinkering was was Freedom autonomy sovereignty was that a big part of the value set at that point or did that come over time as you're exposed to more the online space and people talking about it yeah it was only after Max was born so max is my son it's only after Max was born that I started to look at them environment we're in and not one to not want to have children in the in the system the type of things that we call them that we maybe not say out loud the consequence of what I did became much more real yeah that it wasn't just me and I could float through and it didn't matter if I maybe did things that were compromising values working in an industry that keeps people in debt didn't matter right there's no consequence it was I was making money who cares yeah yeah but after he was born I was looking at what we are in in the system yeah in terms of the system of society and especially in Western society and I was okay you need to have options yeah and the belief that has never gone away is true freedom is Downstream of Financial Freedom yeah so you can make a lot of impact and all these words the buzzwords but unless you've got choices yeah you can't really get to True Freedom and people can throw around what that means to them and it is very personal but it was until Max was born that I really thought I need to cultivate an environment where I'm living in something that gives some choices yeah because of that sense that the world's not going to be the same and if it's the same as it is now then I'd rather plot an alternative course right around it yeah I I feel I didn't even have a work ethic until I got married and especially when I had my first kid Brooklyn seven years ago that was when I felt was I found another gear I was oh okay I the stakes are higher especially because my wife and I for most of our 20s were working for the church we were broke but we were it was a mutually we both decided we were going to be broke and so neither one of us was resentful or bitter it was we're

. S startup but I was in I was in London about two years ahead of the sophistication curve of what what was going to happen what was the market expanding into products expanding into travel and those things yeah and so I went back did some stuff with them on travel and a sales role when you saying we're back you went back to New Zealand went back to New Zealand yeah and that was always in the plan but that freedom thing was under I used to listen to a podcast called tropical MBA right and it was by two two dudes down and in who were here in Bali right at the time over a decade ago wow they were talking about one megabit internet and pitted roads and stuff that which is a bit different to now yeah yeah but the vibe was the same yeah that was that was the beginning of the digital Nomad digital Nomad became a phrase yeah right and I was going on the train into work listening to these dudes jamming and it was that was happening along the way in terms of the the underlying soundtrack of this something something else going on yeah and then went back to New Zealand and went worked on travel got was made marketing manager and my marketing director within a few months and again it's right in the middle of this environment where you can test human psychology right which is addictive right yeah you put these things out there on mass and large numbers and how people respond yeah and that that's super addictive to me so I've always been in the middle of that interrelationship and the feedback loop of in business of making offers and and watching those things come back and how are people responding to this how are they acting yeah but and that cut my teeth in terms of to where we are now and what we do now and so in that time was were you approaching things as an artist or an engineer was there a mix of both was it you feeling you were creating or is building the machine and the numbers and the we sent out an email that got this click-through rate was it a mix of both how are you naturally wired and what was coming out of their time at the time it was not artists it was more teacher whereas I've stopped the responsibility of being a fan rather seriously in terms of being I'm trying to be a model and I distinctly remember before I went back to New Zealand I made a commitment to give all my ideas away right so I started accepting stuff that scared the

[ __ ] out of me speaking gigs and those things which in hindsight was a great move yeah because when I wanted to leave Consulting and those things were not not a problem right because I built a profile and built a reputation and a 100 million dollar business yeah and I think around that time I imagine you probably didn't have the scarcity that kicks in when you then start charging for your information because when you start charging for information you're well if I'm charging for it over here and I give it away over here it must devalue the thing that people are buying yeah but you didn't have that you just had the I'm in the trenches doing it I'm just going to share it because that means no less for me if the thing that I'm doing yeah yeah and it means I don't have the struggle story of when I started Consulting as well right my first monthly invoice 40 Grand yeah perfect because I was mentored by senior people who were you go into companies you tell them what to do you hope they listen and they pay your invoices every month yeah so was it so the Consulting Journey because that sounds it evolved really naturally you became really good in your industry you got head hunted from UK to New Zealand you Rose up the ranks there and then did that Consulting naturally go to in-person consultation where you're working with a team in person it's it's more corporate c-suite type stuff yeah corporate where I had a reputation as someone who was really comfortable sitting in a boardroom and talking the talk commercially right but also getting down on the trenches right because I'd worked in startups you had to be that you had to know how to run a Facebook ad yeah because there wasn't always someone there to do it but you also knew had to know how to talk about a 10 million budget yeah right so the two different skill sets in the end of the spectrum so I was quite used filters when some companies were going into the scrappy incubator stage we're going to start up lots of internal tests and start businesses inside where I go along and talk to them in corporate speak but also startup speak because they knew that I'd be happy to get my hand to roll my sleeves up and do stuff and so when you think back to that period was that a seamless transition was that something that came with reservations or fears there was any sense of imposter syndrome because I know working with people in the online space and it's different when you go from I'm using my Facebook for friends and family and then all of a sudden I'm a business coach and there's that element but going from being the person who got had a job was paying to do it to now teaching other people was there things you had to overcome was there a story you had to unravel what was that process for you to get started the biggest thing the biggest thing for me was a discipline of it because the work was so easy that I had to learn lots of things to Pat it out you know so there was a discipline of it of is this am I doing the right thing am I doing the right am I doing the right job because lots of people wouldn't even listen to the advice that I was giving them yeah right so then you start to have the moral questions around it but I I had the easiest start to Consulting ever because I consulted back to the company that I that I was formerly a marketing director right so it's struggle to get your first client we just signed the people you used to work with and then start adding clients from there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for four months too long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would walk me through it and something about the weekly coaching sessions that's a a relic of of old we've been together for an hour I drive to you you

there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for four months too long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would walk me through it and something about the weekly coaching sessions that's a a relic of of old we've been together for an hour I drive to you you drive to me we do it on Zoom whatever and making the decision you want to make but are too scared to make it yeah and seeking permission in some other way yeah so the big fear was leaving my first client but that's when I'm met a young Sam Evans young saying moments I love it all Circle back to him in a second because obviously he played a crucial role for both he did yeah but with you in the role that you're in then being able to consult yeah it sounds it's nice for you James but I have to you know get clients and I don't have that but also for you I imagine there was years behind the scenes you're kind of skimming over the fact that I imagine there was a lot of really deep skill set building throughout that time it wasn't just right place right time I could talk the talk I imagine there was the hours of podcasts the blogs the whatever it might be what did that process of building the skill set so the company that you worked for they still had to see enough value in what you did to want to pay you the money that you charged what was that process to build that skill set at work right I I developed a deep skill set across sales and marketing specifically by doing it yeah right in the in the train it's had Blue Chip sales Vodafone BMW and Xerox sales training which is Xerox sales training in Europe is considered to be the best sales training on earth right relationship building and those things from corporate Enterprise all the way down to selling phones in a shop yeah a Vodafone when I worked in there in New Zealand when I was a student and it's getting the skills on the and but also and I think I'm more ruthless about these days it's focusing on what you're good at because there's so much idealism around skill acquisition because everything's a skill yeah and it's and it's really okay double down on what you're good at and largely ignore the bits that you that you aren't and that's a tough lesson to learn I was a terrible people manager right and I inherited these teams and I didn't know what didn't know how to manage I'm gonna run ads guys it's going to be awesome yeah but I'd lean in on the commercials on the marketing on the detail of those things yeah and go back to them and the results will always take take you through you don't have to be the easiest person to work with yeah you don't even have to be liked but if you're effective you can go a really long way right so I think I always focused on things I was effective at and avoid it out of probably internal fear all the things I was I was I was proving to be bad at yeah which I think is also underrated I think too many people try to generalize too fast yeah I've shamed myself horribly for that over the years of no I should build a team yeah I should be a good manager I should be this I should be there and it doesn't matter how hard you wish for it if there's no true genuine desire there yeah it's very difficult to acquire skills when you don't have desire behind them yeah it's very difficult to wear I really want to be good at this and I need to be good at this when there's no actual want deep inside you to want to do it well well I think we'll come back to this but this idea that business needs to be hard is a really prevalent one because I think business is already hard because we have to grow and gain
