# New Transcripts James - Part 6

. Steve Roberts: He's not quite there yet, but yet he's still with me. So Steve Roberts: when you said you're helping them find the route to their freedom, I think that was really Steve Roberts: quite well, well, put as far as my experience working with that particular client is, it's Steve Roberts: peeling back the layers Shrek. keep it James Kemp: Yeah. And it's not judging it as well that James Kemp: that an adult male, it would be easy to judge that that an adult male is scared of taking a shirt off in public James Kemp: he's not scared of nuclear war, or his family dying in a car accident, or anything he's scared of taking his shirt off. James Kemp: and it would be really easy to judge that right. But the significance of that to that individual is huge. James Kemp: It's really huge Steve Roberts: Yeah. Yeah. Steve Roberts: And and just to add on that, for someone who hasn't had a fear of that before, it is difficult Steve Roberts: to try and position that as a problem for others. Steve Roberts: because you don't have the problem yourself. So that was one thing I was gonna . Steve Roberts:, if you don't have a problem with something, how do you raise the problem of something James Kemp: That's called empathy Steve Roberts: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: Bye, I have lots of money. James Kemp: and I'm not embarrassed to say that I'm quite rich, right. James Kemp: but it's really easy for me to help to wake up every day and go. James Kemp: How does everyone make more money? People want to make more money. Do you want money it's? It's a good resource to have right James Kemp: my needs. James Kemp: I fulfill my own needs, and I am highly empathetic and effective at what I do. James Kemp: because I don't judge what other people's needs are Steve Roberts: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: I have literal millionaires crying with me about how they feel broke James Kemp: because they're friends with billionaires and stuff that. James Kemp: And sometimes and I laugh with them usually right, but I don't judge it at all. James Kemp: It's it's comedy. James Kemp: I'm you don't feel safe. They don't feel safe. James Kemp: They're a human being, and the the reason that most people are James Kemp: a broke is because they judge other people's needs. I don't want that. Well, no one gives a fuck what you want. Really. James Kemp: you're there to fulfill your own needs. James Kemp: So empathy is, is putting yourself in someone's shoes and saying. James Kemp: taking your shirt off at the beach, or making another 10 million dollars, or whatever a valid goals. James Kemp: at least, for now Steve Roberts: Hmm. James Kemp: But along the way maybe we reframe it. James Kemp: because I bet if you worked with that guy long enough you probably he could probably not lose another kilo. James Kemp: and if he was coached on on a dimension of self-esteem he'd be taking his shirt off because he realizes it didn't matter. James Kemp: Just the guys chasing the next 1 million. And the next 10 million realizes it didn't really matter. James Kemp: It was just an irrational fear Steve Roberts: Yeah, that's correct. Steve Roberts: That's empathy. James Kemp: Empathy is understanding, that the that the individual human experience James Kemp: is exactly that it's individual, it's reality. This thing we call reality is consensus reality. The individual's reality is the individual

. James Kemp: Just the guys chasing the next 1 million. And the next 10 million realizes it didn't really matter. James Kemp: It was just an irrational fear Steve Roberts: Yeah, that's correct. Steve Roberts: That's empathy. James Kemp: Empathy is understanding, that the that the individual human experience James Kemp: is exactly that it's individual, it's reality. This thing we call reality is consensus reality. The individual's reality is the individual. James Kemp: What they're scared of, what you're scared of, what I'm scared of and James Kemp: utterly different things. And it's our job not to judge it Steve Roberts: Yeah. Steve Roberts: And I could probably lead with John there. Sometimes you feel you're posting too much, not getting much back, and it's, oh, shit if I stay quiet, post the odd thing and someone reacts. Oh, then that was a good strategy, whereas you never know who this could be, for it could be the the rich guy who's still afraid to take you the beach, and he could be in the very high percentage of people who take action or problem solvers, but haven't solved this one problem themselves. Steve Roberts: So your marketing piece might be Steve Roberts: talking to all level of action takers Steve Roberts: who still might have a problem with that. Steve Roberts: So just because you swing it doesn't mean you're gonna hit. Steve Roberts: The action takers who are still Steve Roberts: not comfortable with their shit off at the beach. James Kemp: Yeah, there's lots of variables in terms of audience and state they're in and how they consume stuff and what they buy Steve Roberts: Right. James Kemp: But the the most effective marketing talks to unspoken needs Steve Roberts: Talks, to James Kemp: Unspoken needs. Steve Roberts: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's great. I'm just to close the loop on that on the social posting of that. You're not gonna send invitation. It's Steve Roberts: something different. But, I'm looking for people who, in this high level program Steve Roberts: your social post is around that subject. Steve Roberts: Let me know if you want the If James Kemp: Well, I'd I'd be talking in content in this scenario. James Kemp: A lot more to the not, hey? He lost 15 kilos Steve Roberts: Hmm. James Kemp: It's hey? He can now take a shirt off at the beach. After not doing that for 18 years. Steve Roberts: Yeah. Yeah. Steve Roberts: Great. James Kemp: why, James Kemp: lots of people want a business so they can tell their mom and dad that they made it Steve Roberts: Very subtle, James, isn't it? Steve Roberts: It's just a it's a subtle tweak of the. James Kemp: It's it's the. James Kemp: It's the base human needs, right? James Kemp: And all the things that we do. And there, we say, are just just just constructed on top of those base human needs James Kemp: for safety, for social acceptance, for reproduction. Steve Roberts: . James Kemp: Accumulation of power is just a vectoring away from threat. James Kemp: having a social group and having friends or being attractive to the opposite sex is just a vector, away from James Kemp: from threat. James Kemp: Right? So it's safety Steve Roberts: I knew I took the Dao of teaching for another reason today, James. Thank you. James Kemp: If you, if you, if you talk to the underlying pieces. James Kemp: you can still be in the market of selling weight loss, selling money Steve Roberts: Hmm

. James Kemp: having a social group and having friends or being attractive to the opposite sex is just a vector, away from James Kemp: from threat. James Kemp: Right? So it's safety Steve Roberts: I knew I took the Dao of teaching for another reason today, James. Thank you. James Kemp: If you, if you, if you talk to the underlying pieces. James Kemp: you can still be in the market of selling weight loss, selling money Steve Roberts: Hmm. James Kemp: But if you talk to the underlying pieces of the of the actual needs of the individual James Kemp: and and their desires, you will capture far more James Kemp: intent based attention than anyone else. James Kemp: Right? People don't James Kemp: lose weight for the sake of losing weight. They don't make money for the sake of making money, of accumulating and sitting in massive piles. They they do it for James Kemp: for safety, for status, which is again James Kemp: are moving away from unsafe. Steve Roberts: Yeah, type. James Kemp: So if we talk to just those things below the surface. James Kemp: we get the people who are you're talking to me. James Kemp: And, at a very simplistic level. This is why people are told to be authentic on social media. James Kemp: but that's turned into performative authenticity of . James Kemp: Hey, I broke my foot. Come to my webinar, and you're what the fuck's that got to do with anything James Kemp: right. And this is why vulnerability James Kemp: will always get large points of attention. But again, it's then manipulated into types of attention to. James Kemp: I broke out with my girlfriend, give me $97. You're, what, what are these things got to do with each other? Right Steve Roberts: It's James Kemp: But if if we talk to the if we talk to the underlying human motivations, then we are. James Kemp: are hacking into someone's subconscious. James Kemp: which is, we are talking to things that maybe they wouldn't even talk about within James Kemp: partner or the people closest to them insecurities. James Kemp: And again, the more outward someone is, often the more inward they are with those insecurities Steve Roberts: In the white. You would elude that Steve Roberts: problem that you help them overcome Steve Roberts: in your social posts. We go, hey? It's chatting. One of the guys in my group the other day, and Steve Roberts: we've we've moved a long way. We've come a long way. You don't talk about the specifics I guess of. He's lost 15 kgs, and he's lifting James Kemp: You do, because objective measures are meaningful too. Steve Roberts: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: But you talk to the thing that it's done. Steve Roberts: Yeah, yeah. James Kemp: I James Kemp: Jk shared a couple of weeks ago how he's at 100 KA month because he stated that, 17 months ago. He's going to get to 100 KA month. James Kemp: It's way cooler him talking about getting married this month James Kemp: and going on honeymoon for 2 months, and then. James Kemp: there's something else happening as well. But it's way cooler for that. James Kemp: Then it's what it breeds in his life. James Kemp: Yeah, he came to me for to make more money. James Kemp: but he did it so he could do these other things safely. Steve Roberts: You just use your initials. Are you talking about an example of a person James Kemp: Yeah. Jk molina. Steve Roberts: Oh, sorry, Ron. I thought you were talking about yourself

. But it's way cooler for that. James Kemp: Then it's what it breeds in his life. James Kemp: Yeah, he came to me for to make more money. James Kemp: but he did it so he could do these other things safely. Steve Roberts: You just use your initials. Are you talking about an example of a person James Kemp: Yeah. Jk molina. Steve Roberts: Oh, sorry, Ron. I thought you were talking about yourself. Steve Roberts: Thought it might be more than that James Kemp: He calls himself young Jk. And oh! Steve Roberts: Legend. James Kemp: Tapping, tapping human desire is how James Kemp: we speak to the experience of the people that we help. James Kemp: We layer over the the objective measures of specificity. James Kemp: But in our content and context, where James Kemp: to the best of our ability, talking about what? That, what that gets them James Kemp:. Losing weight isn't a James Kemp: isn't a path to being later on escape James Kemp: as a path to potentially being feeling better about oneself James Kemp: individually, but also feeling better about what oneself, so they so they can James Kemp: date for the 1st time before . Be on tinder for the 1st time in 5 years, or whatever it is James Kemp: making money is not James Kemp: just a greedy capitalist accumulation of it. So you feel you're a success in the eyes of your mom. For the, 1st time in 22 years. James Kemp: There's there's there's layers upon layers of these things, as I said to., Lana, a lot of James Kemp: in the corporate world. It's politics, right it is. James Kemp: impressing those above you enough to be one of those above you one day. Right? That's the that's the imperative of the of the of many corporate minds. James Kemp: And so what it looks matters a lot. James Kemp: So let's make sure that we make them look good in the course of helping people and corporate in those environments, because James Kemp: what it looks offer matters more than what it is right. And so we we have to understand James Kemp: the motivations and the environment that the people we work in., what are they? James Kemp: And the more we judge them, the more it blocks us from those things we can say whatever we about James Kemp: taking your shirt off at the beach, and sexual dynamics and corporate dynamics and making money and all these things. But if we sit there in judgment, then it James Kemp: it takes away a lot of our ability to to communicate with people who want James Kemp: more than just the thing on the surface. It's just the thing on the surface is the thing we point to. James Kemp: and then our ability to communicate it as the as the thing that they ultimately get out of it. James Kemp: Okay, Peeps. James Kemp: I'll put up the replay resources and template James Kemp: in the community in a couple hours, and then. James Kemp: if you're a guest, we'll put it on that James Kemp: on the page that you've we sent out last night, and this morning. James Kemp: Thanks, Peeps. James Kemp: I'll see the syndicate folks this afternoon. James Kemp: Bye bye. Quarterly Updates Call: What's up, Ru? I love how there's people I know and people, I dunno, just combining the communities baby. If you're from James' community and James isn't here yet, he is nominated me as your new leader. Unfortunately, you guys are stuck with me., no, I see he is here. what's funny is that it was, I texted him two days ago

. James Kemp: Bye bye. Quarterly Updates Call: What's up, Ru? I love how there's people I know and people, I dunno, just combining the communities baby. If you're from James' community and James isn't here yet, he is nominated me as your new leader. Unfortunately, you guys are stuck with me., no, I see he is here. what's funny is that it was, I texted him two days ago. I was, Hey, are you good for Thursday? And he is, yep. If the baby doesn't come yet, if for those of you who don't know, his, his, fiance is pregnant. And so if he jumps out during this call, we all extend forgiveness of good vibes as he, goes through the rite of passage of becoming a dad Once again. What's up James? The mop. The mop and the bucket are there to clean up the waters, when they're broke. Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh dude, I'm pumped for this call. 'cause we haven't touched base a little bit. The last time, time we touched base I was in America and you're, I have five minutes before clients get here for an event. And so Yeah. Where's the timing, right? Yeah., well we've got two communities here and, but there's probably no lack of people who are winning in some capacity. When you just take a moment to celebrate yourself and just drop in the chat. Where have you won recently? Big, small personal business. I'd really love to invite you to, as we, as we step into this call and we focus on things to do and opportunities, just take a moment and celebrate, whether people in this chat or you do not, this call I should say., we're all here to celebrate with you., any particular ones you wanna highlight? James? Yeah. Tack on any, tack on any ways your clients are winning because Oh, yeah. I love that. I'm, I'm reminded a lot that we win through people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The more we help other people win, the more we win, and it's a big happy circle. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not great at celebrating clients', clients winning. Yeah, of course. And I probably should ask that question a lot more. No, I think that's really, really good., while we're waiting for people to drop stuff in the chat, is there any, anyone in particular that you wanna highlight that might, may or may not be on the call? We always have amazing, wins in our community there. Anything that comes to mind for you? I just, to honor Janine Ghana because Janine's a Janine came to see me in Bali. Well, I say a few weeks ago. Everything feels a few weeks ago at the moment, but it's a couple of months ago now. And I, I remember what it was trying to battle those two worlds of being in the corporate world and having these sweet, sweet, big checks, raining out of the sky and we want you to speak and we want you to do this. And then trying to build something with a little bit more leverage, a little bit more freedom on the side and straddling that. And Janine's had an amazing quarter, put some great numbers on the scoreboard, but she's also straddle those two worlds beautifully as well, and said no to stuff and said yes to stuff as well. So I know how challenging it is. So I wanna honor that Guys. Shout out Janine, that's amazing., I want to shout out this guy who just joined an inner circle, a couple weeks ago. His name is Teo. He's on this call., by the way, if you guys can't do video, totally get it

. So I know how challenging it is. So I wanna honor that Guys. Shout out Janine, that's amazing., I want to shout out this guy who just joined an inner circle, a couple weeks ago. His name is Teo. He's on this call., by the way, if you guys can't do video, totally get it. If you're driving, please don't crash. But if you're just being antisocial, I invite you to turn your cameras on., as I promise you, it will be a more electric call if we, if James and I don't feel we're just talking to ourselves., so Teo, came to the Mexico intensive. So every intensive I run, it's free for clients. And, we have guests come in and Teo messaged me. He signed up. We had a very, very short back and forth, and I really couldn't catch his vibe at all. And little did I know he was, natively Spanish speaker, English, second language. And I was, trying to figure out, who is this guy? And so anyway, he comes to the event and he tells me that he bought a hundred dollars product that I have called Inbox Income. The next month he made $40,000 replicating that, that system in the Spanish market. And then he signed up for Inner Circle. And I was, firstly, this is the most nonlinear way to become a client., normally you don't get results that from a hundred dollars thing, and then you don't come to an event first. But I was just blown away because Teo is 18 years old and his business partner is at the ripe old age of 19. And it was just so crazy to see these two amazing humans in Mexico doing work. Not just learning funnel stuff that's accessible for anyone now, but doing really meaningful work around leadership in, in a game, at 18 and 19., I was barely, I'd barely stopped playing with Lego at 18. And so to see where they are now was unbelievable., so shout out Teo and shout out Janine., there's a bunch of wins in here., Ian landed two figure, two, seven figure earners, not two figure earners. I guess that would be they made a dollar or $10, from cold traffic. YouTube. That's amazing. Justin sold six memberships in his group., two workshop tickets. Client made her first dollar ever online. That's epic. The first dollar man, dude, I'm telling you, the first dollar is harder than the, than the first 10,000., that's epic. Jared got 80 downloads of his book in last week after five rounds of testing landing page clients winning team worked with last year. And built foundations are undefeated. Kyla got six new clients in the last two weeks with a new offer. That's epic. My man Ray, just had a client able to contribute to their retirement for the first time since starting their business. That's, that's meaningful, dude. That's amazing., Elizabeth Benny, clients are freaking transforming. Big tears are transformational all around making money, marriages, repairing clients, setting up for themselves. That's very, very cool., there's a whole bunch more here, but that is, Caroline got seven returning clients to a new program. Absolutely Epic., Zach Sson, I do not know you, but I see your face all over my feed. So great to see you on this. Great to see you on this call., well, James, let's get into this kind of raw messy format that we, we've obviously perfected after one previous call, this, but, I think we'll be, We're gonna run a workshop on, on messy Catchups. Totally. This is, you guys have all been auto deducted another a hundred dollars. We've auto, we've auto deducted your credit cards
