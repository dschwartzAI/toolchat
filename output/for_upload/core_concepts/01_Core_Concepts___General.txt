# Core Concepts - General

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

[Diagram showing a stack of services:
Deep Dives ● Consulting Hours ● Zoom Mentorship ● Slack Coaching ● The Syndicate ● Clients]
Price Engineering
Pricing is an extensive topic that can be boiled down to a simple principle:
The lower the dollar figure we ask for today, the higher the volume achieved.
If you optimise pricing, you stand to both make multiples of your current revenue and have a higher caliber client and results.
There is no one size fits all with pricing.
Use my Office Hours to get specific help from me on your pricing.
In general; for coaching and consulting the smallest unit of time and money is the week.
Weekly pricing allows us to offer the lowest possible Now Number to a prospect.
It's easier to say yes to $300 now than $1200 now.
The Two Now Numbers to optimise for:
1. How much they pay today. 2. How much they save today.
Traditional example:
Coaching program: $1500 per month/$18k per year $17k for the year
Hybrid Program: $400 per week $17k for the year (save $3000)
When I have run these structures side by side with clients and partners, The Hybrid Offer outperforms the traditional structure by 2-3x in both conversions and cash collected.
And...having weekly recurring revenue is cashflow on steroids compared to the relative lumpiness of monthly billing.
Stacking Economics
Stacking a community with coaching, consulting and services on top just makes sense.

I use a combination of ongoing consulting, mentorship, one time consulting hours and in-person events.
1 in 3 community members buy some or all of these on joining or within the first 6
[Diagram showing pricing structure:
$2500 - $7500 one off ● $2000 - $20,000 one off ● $1200 pw ● $600 pw ● $300 pw ● Clients]
Offer Creation Using The 3 P's
These are 3 principles to get you started:
1/ Promise and Plan
The offer lives and dies on the first page. Actually, the first 3 paragraphs. Get these right and the offer sells itself.
Clearly articulating the Promise of what gets done and the Plan of how it rolls out allows the prospect to 'see' the future if they commit to buying.
This is distinct from the logistics of how and when the offer is delivered.
No one cares how many calls there are or how much coaching they get until they are committed to the result that the Promise and Plan describe.
Match this to the 'right' price and you are 80% there is having a high converting offer.
Promise
What gets done? ● What can you point at? ● Can you describe what they will see show up in their lives if they commit? ● Can you articulate in words their deepest desires better than they can? ● Bonus: What aren't they going to do and what negatives downsides are you helping the avoid?
Plan
What happens first? ● What happens next? ● What happens after that?

Have you painted a clear picture of how the next few days and weeks look like and what
they will see show up? (future pacing)
Clear beat's cute. Name and brand your systems but don't overdo it.
Price
● Have you made it easy to get started? ● Does your price factor in the cost of inaction?
Is there a clear ROI?
No one wants to watch 54 videos and attend 10 hours of calls a week.
Telling people whats IN it is more likely to kill demand than enhance it.
Examples:
The Syndicate Example
Offer conversion rate of 32% ● Average client value 121% above entry price ● Chosen to make no guarantees or promises
October 2023: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lbn2n_YYd8lPgYqvHqPoB-4p2UPkTk2ly8Q5t984c/edit?u sp=sharing
Stacking LTV
Offering upgrade options is the way to maximise revenue.
Offering TOO MANY upgrade options when presenting the offer will harm conversions.
To allow us to maximise revenue we must discern when to present them.
The checkout page is the first touch point after the offer doc.
You can add additional options that will get direct purchases, create enquiry and flag to the client that they can add additional services and access to you now or in the future.

Order Summary Item: Syndicate, Private Slack Coaching and Private Zoom Mentorship $1300 Weekly (Save $1000) Quantity: 1 Amount: $1300.00
Order Total: $1300.00
Stacking PIF
Simply having a Pay in Full option in the cart.
I've found you get higher conversion to PIF when it's NOT previously mentioned in the offer.
To maximise, PIF a 'discount' of 25-35% against the total of the pay plan will do it.
Best of Both Worlds
Simply have a PIF in the cart then offer upgrade options during onboarding.
Implementation:
Checklist:
1. Does your offer clearly define The 3 P's? 2. Does your offer use price engineering to maximise conversions and 'yes'? 3. Do you want to stack PIF or Stack LTV (or both)?
Discernment in using this training:
The 3P's will increase the conversions of your offer ● Price Engineering will increase the conversions of your offer and extend LTV ● Stacking will increase your LTV
All of these significantly move the needle. Be discerning when you add them.
If you know your market and audience very well you may choose to use all of the them simultaneously.
If you're just getting rolling, use them one at a time to boost conversions if your focus is making more sales or boost LTV if your focus is creating more value from the sales you're currently making.

# DarkJK Sales & Marketing Mastery
## The Only Marketing Formula You Need **Audience × Offer × Copy = Results**
Miss any element and you get zero. Master all three and you print money.
## Audience: Finding Your People
### The Ideal Client Avatar Exercise Stop trying to sell to everyone. Define ONE person: - **Demographics**: Age, income, location, profession - **Psychographics**: Values, fears, desires, beliefs - **Behavioral**: Where they hang out, what they buy, who they follow - **Problem State**: What keeps them up at night? - **Dream State**: What does success look like to them?
### The 1000 True Fans Principle You don't need millions. You need 1000 people who: - Have the problem you solve - Have money to pay for the solution - Are actively looking for help - Trust you to deliver results
**Math**: 1000 fans × $1000/year = $1M business

## The Sales Mindset
### Beliefs That Sell - Selling is serving - Rejection is redirection - Price is only an issue in the absence of value - The fortune is in the follow-up - Everyone is not your customer - No is closer to yes than maybe

The Rhythm
Generating attention and creating sales doesn’t happen in a single moment.
It’s an accumulation of activities.
You’re going to have hits and flops.
The state you are seeking is momentum.
When you are in motion you will get attention and interaction.
You need to find and stick to a rhythm.
Make a plan. Stick to it. Assess results. Repeat.
A good plan can fit on one page.

Products
Two classes of offers.
Customer and Client.
Creating offers around the product is what we do.
The Product is the thing you deliver. The Offer is the way you sell it.
The Product can be static.
The Offer Dynamic. The more creative the better.
Plan
The perfect plan is one you execute.
The simple principle is to have contrast with your offers.
Use deadlines and scarcity readily.
Oscillate between Customer offers that are easy to buy and Client offers that require more qualification and investment.
Tap into different parts of your audience who are at different stages.
Promote
Content is needed to give context to the offer.
Consistency and volume of content lead to quality of content.
After The Plan, there are simple buckets of content types that can be created regularly.
Philosophy ● Proof ● Problem

The best content blends these concepts together.
It’s much more useful to illustrate with examples vs concepts:
Philosophy
What you personally believe to be true.
What do you believe? What do you observe? How do you think differently about common ideas? What is hiding in plain sight? What do you see that is hidden to others?
Proof
Prove that you can help someone by demonstrating how you helped someone.
Solid proof goes beyond ‘testimonials’.
It delivers insight on how someone you worked with got a result.

Problem
Share insight that you gather from delivering.
The more common the struggle and the more unique your approach to solving it, the more traction these posts get.
These are give it all away posts.
Don’t hold back in observing and offering a solution to the common problems of your audience that you know the solution to.

Distribute
Content needs distribution. Go where your audience is.
Primary and Secondary.
Primary Channel = Email
Secondary Channel = Facebook
Publish for the primary channel and also distribute via the secondary channel.
