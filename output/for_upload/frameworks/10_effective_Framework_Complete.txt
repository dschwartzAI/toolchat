# effective Framework

## Overview

** Live workshops are a highly effective method for converting customers to clients.

## Complete Framework

. Right? The the key piece, and the piece of both. The other piece of experimentation is around converting those those book customers into clients. So I've done 2 things, and I'm gonna double down on one of these things. and discard the other just through experimentation. So the 1st one is putting them on a wait list. And if you want the wait list again, it's in the waitlist training in in the classroom. ## Live Workshops: A High-Leverage Path to Client Acquisition **Summary:** Live workshops are a highly effective method for converting customers to clients. They provide valuable content, increase time on brand, and offer a natural opportunity to pitch client programs. A converting live workshop can also become a standalone product, further increasing leverage. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I'm going to double down on live workshops for 2 reasons. A live workshop is a better product than a static course. So I'm gonna change my $200 upsell into a a course and a program and bonuses. But it's around a live workshop. and a live workshop is a much higher converting path from customers to clients right? We know around here that, people can easily get 10 to 40% of people who come to a workshop into their community or client program. If I was starting from scratch I would sell a live workshop in the funnel and get people who buy the book into that into that live workshop and ultimately pitch the client program from there. ## Book Funnel Templates, the Sovereign Book Club, and Done-For-You Services **Summary:** James Kemp offers funnel templates and announces the Sovereign Book Club, an 8-week program to help participants create, market, and launch their own book funnels. A done-for-you service is also available for those who prefer to outsource the process. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So 2 things left. We've got some swipes. Chris has put together way more than I asked him to. He's massively over delivered. We've got creative swipes. We got the copy swipes. and we've got the funnel template. This is the I'm not sure if you can see that this is the live book funnel that we're running on software consultant. So as you can see, it's done. 40 ish brand on the front end. This is the exact funnel that I've given you. So I've given you everything in this one. So it's got the sales page, the upsell, the downsell, the confirmation, and then we've included the wait list, and then we've included the delivery components of the of the different of the different upsells and downsells, so you can drop your upsell and downsell, and that delivery. ## The Sovereign Book Club: An 8-Week Book Funnel Creation Program **Summary:** The Sovereign Book Club offers an 8-week guided program for creating a book, developing upsells, building a funnel, and running paid ads.

# acquisition Framework

## Overview

The acquisition framework consists of ) Repeat what works, ) Expand your personal capacity.

## Complete Framework

They can easily double their ad spend while maintaining current KPI's and keeping a careful eye on the break point.
2) Repeat what works:
The largest single increase in their revenue was running a challenge. They have then worked to lift their acquisition system to maintain this level of growth. The paid acquisition has grown them last month as much as the challenge grew them previous. They tried some other events that didn't move the needle. Everything works but only a few strategies will work for you and your audience. Schedule, repeat and optimise those. Growth is 90% repetition and 10% innovation.
3) Expand your personal capacity:
A weird thing happens when you see growth that you previously dreamed of: It's achieved by a small number of actions. When you've hustled your way through the initial growth this is jarring. You feel like you should be 'doing' more. You start to tinker and lose site that there's a small number of activities you must do. I learned this the hard way myself. When you see rapid growth your leverage comes from becoming the person who can hold onto it. You can also find yourself thinking you're too good for the inner work. Focus, creation and expansion of your relational/emotional/physical/spiritual worlds is what grows you into the person who can maintain it. The growth was pointless without maintenance. Some have to go through this gain/loss cycle many times before they can hold it.
I didn't do any of this. They did.
I provide weekly perspective, experience and insight.
Help them see the important vs the pointless. Work is required.
Smart or hard is the choice.
If you want an offer that can achieve hyper growth you'll want to pick up The Offer Code.
