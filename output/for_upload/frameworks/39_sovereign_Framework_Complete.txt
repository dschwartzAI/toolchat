## Complete Framework

- ## Creating a $100k Community: Product and Offer Strategy **Summary:** This session focuses on creating a community-based offer that generates $100k in revenue. James Kemp emphasizes the importance of clear promises, actionable plans, and strategic pricing tiers to maximize both client acquisition and revenue generation. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Morning peeps. I need to take a stance on these otters and the rooms. You end up interacting with otters and AI pilots more than you do with humans. I've got a doc for you as usual. Bear with me on resolution. So, $100k community, today we're going to talk about product and offer. I want to direct us more towards doing in these things rather than, dare I say, mental masturbation. The philosophy is important, but that's consumed by the learning and the doing. Today is about product and offer, next week, validating it with the founding members frame. Week 3 is next steps. Even those with existing community offers could do with sharpening. Results are always relative. How fast you get results comes from what you already have, and what work you're about to do. Sales are a product of 3 factors: audience (60%), offer (30%), and copy (10%). The audience is a product of what you've done before. The offer is how clear, relevant, and timely it is. Clarity is what promises it makes, relevance is how relevant that promise is right now, and timing can leverage trends. Copy is just the words you use. A receptive audience and a clear offer will take you 90% of the way there quickly. Your offer is your offer, relational to your marketplace and audience. Why community? Four reasons: monetizing an audience (most of your audience hasn't bought from you), a home for your stuff (reduces decision fatigue), ascending clients (easy start point), and taking prospects off the market. Economics: our goal is $100k from a community. In the sovereign system, we have clients, customers, and leads. We get leads, turn them into customers, and turn customers into clients. Some people will pay 50 times more than others. Economics comes from paying in full for 12 months and clients signing into higher tiers. The path to $100k is unlikely to be 20 people at $100/week. It's likely to be a mix: some at $100/week, some paying $3k for 12 months upfront, and some at a higher tier ($300/week). If you have a big audience, a straight community level can work. But to maximize revenue, a higher tier is essential. A community has 3 components: content, the community itself, and customization. The simplest model is tier one ($100/week) with a training portal, community platform, and customization (group calls). Tier 2 is for those who want to go faster, including done-for-you components. If you have an existing high-ticket program, insert the community below it. The community offer is 12 months. ## Defining Your Core Offer and Crafting Compelling Promises **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of focusing on a single core benefit in your offer. James explains how to articulate the promise and plan of your offer to resonate with your target audience and drive conversions. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Four reasons people buy: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Everything outside the core reason is a benefit. I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. Your core piece stems from your own beliefs. While I say a lot of things, I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. As you get more experienced, you deliver more benefits

> "I want your support in getting offers pumping out cash without me having to crank the handle myself. Our goal is building a $3k offer that you take to $3k per week clockwork."
 The plan: 
> "We will install the sovereign system, talk about the client offer, customer offers, and then install the daily client machine."
 The promise, the plan, and the phases. This offer lives and dies on this page. Everything else is logistics. Price is relevant to value. $100/week. What's the risk? Weekly frame, come in, can leave. I choose no guarantees, promises, or refunds. Guarantees are a product of trust perception. The more track record you have, the less you need a guarantee. ## Maximizing Community Economics and the Hybrid Offer Approach **Summary:** James discusses strategies for maximizing community revenue, including offering annual payments with bonuses and utilizing the hybrid offer model to present multiple tiers without confusing potential clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We use the $100/week as a hook. Getting payment upfront is preferable. The average $100/week person stays 15-18 weeks, worth $1500-$1800. If we get $3000 upfront, we get cash upfront and they're more committed. I have a $3900 annual offer with a one-on-one call. This converts at 30%. To maximize conversions, I'd offer it at $2500-$3000. Offering $2500 annually is over a 50% discount. We use pricing to incentivize and collect cash. The hybrid offer sells the first tier without harming conversion to the client offer. 
> "You're receiving regular workshops and 24/7 access. Beyond that, have an option for my personal help. Members can upgrade or I can build you a custom plan to take an offer from $3k to $3k/week to $3k/day."
 The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."
