# that Framework

## Overview

That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you.

## Complete Framework

## The Dual-Mode Funnel Concept And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, download a lead magnet, and, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, people, are always looking for the best funnel. And, one of my most annoying phrases is, everything works right but who it's for? And when are the other determinants? And searching for the best funnel is is one of those endless ones when the constraints are predetermined. So the traditional lead generation of get a lead nurture, nurture, nurture. Watch people drop off and get a client works. It still works. but it's hard to scale. It's expensive. You need to be very good. And and ultimately it's not going to work forever. So something I've been working on for the past couple of months is bringing the 2 distinct approaches together. So dual mode client generation is a singular idea, deployed in in the same funnel with 2 different funnel types. So what we really want is clients, right? We can use those who won't immediately become clients to fund our marketing to get clients. That's the I think it's a little bit of a black pill. That's a bit cynical that the people who aren't going to become clients are giving you money to find the people who are, if you . There are lots of people who are going to buy low ticket products from you, and will never become a client, but they'll give you cash flow to go and find clients right? So what we really want is clients. And what we really want is that the efficient way to do that? So this funnel monetizes IP that we've already got, we can use those who who won't immediately become clients to fund the acquisition of them, and we shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness of prospects. And if we think about lead generation. And we think about the way it is. Now, download a lead magnet, and, get 3% of the results out of that, then that system is not going to stand the test of time, but it still works, and it still has a has a component in it so the other component that sits in the the mental stages, people, are always looking for the best funnel.

## Q&A: Funnel Implementation & Testing julie williams: Hi, Jack, can I jump in here? Yeah, thanks. Yeah. I'm about to listen. I'm just wondering. The back end of all this that you're doing is that in go high level under workflows. James Kemp: The the funnel templates are there, but they're all high level pages. They're all. julie williams: Yeah, because I'm working with upwork at the moment on getting out a nurture or a workflow in go high level. So we've got similar to. One offer is to book a call. No one ever books a call, and they don't know you. So from there it then jumps to. I've got a 12 page. Report that outlines what I do with a call to action on the end of that. If they don't, if they take that 12 page report. They still don't do anything. It flips then to the next section of A. My ultimate initial offering is to book in for a 6 week fast track of my bigger 16 week mastermind program. So that's ultimately where I want them to end up. And then I've got a what else have I got? I've got something else in there, if they don't do that. So we're just trying to work them through to take up some offer in that process in go high level, and it's about to be launched into some people I've mined in Linkedin. But I'm just wondering with this. DM. 2 that you do it? Is it? Is that what you called it? Hang on a minute. Yeah. Number 2. Cause I did your 3 K code way back. What is the difference between a nurture campaign or a workflow and your new? This new thing? Can you make it a bit clearer for me? So I don't really understand it. What the difference is, and am I on the right track? Do. James Kemp: I'm not here. I'm not here to, educate you on that distinction. If you if you're in motion with something, then it will be a mistake to switch it without testing it. So if you've got that funnel ready to go, put a hundred people through it. julie williams: But a hundred only I've got about 1,500 at the moment we've accumulated, but I haven't done anything with them at this point, so I'm just a bit unsure. What's gonna happen there? But why, only a hundred. James Kemp: Just to get some confidence. What happens when a hundred people go through? Yeah, often reflects what happens when a thousand people go through. julie williams: Right. So he's saying. James Kemp: Then what your level of commitment and investment to it., if a hundred people go through and do nothing, you need to change something. 100 people go through and do something. . 5 of them do something. Then you put it in front of a thousand. James Kemp: Then what your level of commitment and investment to it., if a hundred people go through and do nothing, you need to change something. 100 people go through and do something. . 5 of them do something. Then you put it in front of a thousand. julie williams: Hmm, yeah, right? So continue on the path. I'm going with the workflow. Test it out. But then, how does this fit in here? James Kemp: It's. julie williams: This is more about Vsls. James Kemp: For you right now, Julie. you're you're doing something. This isn't about getting in. I should have. I should have said that caveat at the top

. So I know how challenging it is. So I wanna honor that Guys. Shout out Janine, that's amazing., I want to shout out this guy who just joined an inner circle, a couple weeks ago. His name is Teo. He's on this call., by the way, if you guys can't do video, totally get it. If you're driving, please don't crash. But if you're just being antisocial, I invite you to turn your cameras on., as I promise you, it will be a more electric call if we, if James and I don't feel we're just talking to ourselves., so Teo, came to the Mexico intensive. So every intensive I run, it's free for clients. And, we have guests come in and Teo messaged me. He signed up. We had a very, very short back and forth, and I really couldn't catch his vibe at all. And little did I know he was, natively Spanish speaker, English, second language. And I was, trying to figure out, who is this guy? And so anyway, he comes to the event and he tells me that he bought a hundred dollars product that I have called Inbox Income. The next month he made $40,000 replicating that, that system in the Spanish market. And then he signed up for Inner Circle. And I was, firstly, this is the most nonlinear way to become a client., normally you don't get results that from a hundred dollars thing, and then you don't come to an event first. But I was just blown away because Teo is 18 years old and his business partner is at the ripe old age of 19. And it was just so crazy to see these two amazing humans in Mexico doing work. Not just learning funnel stuff that's accessible for anyone now, but doing really meaningful work around leadership in, in a game, at 18 and 19., I was barely, I'd barely stopped playing with Lego at 18. And so to see where they are now was unbelievable., so shout out Teo and shout out Janine., there's a bunch of wins in here., Ian landed two figure, two, seven figure earners, not two figure earners. I guess that would be they made a dollar or $10, from cold traffic. YouTube. That's amazing. Justin sold six memberships in his group., two workshop tickets. Client made her first dollar ever online. That's epic. The first dollar man, dude, I'm telling you, the first dollar is harder than the, than the first 10,000., that's epic. Jared got 80 downloads of his book in last week after five rounds of testing landing page clients winning team worked with last year. And built foundations are undefeated. Kyla got six new clients in the last two weeks with a new offer. That's epic. My man Ray, just had a client able to contribute to their retirement for the first time since starting their business. That's, that's meaningful, dude. That's amazing., Elizabeth Benny, clients are freaking transforming. Big tears are transformational all around making money, marriages, repairing clients, setting up for themselves. That's very, very cool., there's a whole bunch more here, but that is, Caroline got seven returning clients to a new program. Absolutely Epic., Zach Sson, I do not know you, but I see your face all over my feed. So great to see you on this. Great to see you on this call., well, James, let's get into this kind of raw messy format that we, we've obviously perfected after one previous call, this, but, I think we'll be, We're gonna run a workshop on, on messy Catchups. Totally. This is, you guys have all been auto deducted another a hundred dollars. We've auto, we've auto deducted your credit cards

. Shevaune Ray: And I think you clarified this at the end when you were just talking with Tom. But the the difference in your new daily client machine is Shevaune Ray: selling, both doing it both info and insight, and not one or the other. Is that really the biggest difference. James Kemp: Yeah, yeah, to understanding that the perfect funnel doesn't exist we could run low ticket info funnels, forever. And then we'll just reach James Kemp: the limitations, but would also be missing out on a ton of people who bought in a different way. James Kemp: And also we would buy, we could run, lead, lead funnels and those things all day long. James Kemp: but would also be missing out on the people who buy via an infopath and buy products and consume them, etc. Etc. And that's their buying style. Shevaune Ray: Chat too. James Kemp: And the I'm looking for things sustainable. I don't want to be building a new funnel. James Kemp: . I don't want to be building a new funnel every year. I want the core laid down, and then just reframing it, and modifying it as it goes along, rather than . Oh, my God! The webinars, died after 6 months, or the lead magnet stopped working after 3. James Kemp: That's exhausting for most people. So we need a, we need a methodology and a philosophy that's got utility. We can add different. James Kemp: We can change the video. We can change the frontier product. But. Shevaune Ray: And that's I do appreciate that. I know. I I told you that I just switched over to go high level and I appreciate that about that system is that you can set it up with multiple entry points, and all you have to change is the workflow. Instead of rewriting the whole thing. If you just want to switch something out. James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah., once, once the James Kemp: once we've got the especially the info funnel working, it's, okay, let's put some more offers on the front because the bumps the same, the membership offers the same, the upsells the same. So you're just changing out the front end. And, products, fatigue markets, fatigue, things change, and on an increasingly. James Kemp: quick basis, right? And James Kemp: AI, and these things will accelerate that because people feel that they've got much deeper, information inside than they probably necessarily have, so they'll make very good products. James Kemp: But because people are buying them, and that's proven and gpts. And these things the people who are selling them are doing very well. James Kemp: but also they're on the back end. They're tough to convert, because you've you've given every everybody, everything they needed. James Kemp: And you've you've got true cannibalization. So yeah, it's the. Shevaune Ray: Are you going to talk more about? Shevaune Ray: Were you gonna talk more about AI in this meeting? James Kemp: Not today. Shevaune Ray: Not today. That was the other call, okay? Shevaune Ray: yeah. That's I stuck myself in a a rock and a hard place, because Shevaune Ray: the market shifted just as I was ramping up and really relaunching my new structure. And Shevaune Ray: I'm realizing to get that Shevaune Ray: I used to be able to just sell the high ticket, and a very a piece of unbundled of the the higher ticket. Shevaune Ray: And the market really just is so bored overwhelmed

[ __ ] out of me speaking gigs and those things which in hindsight was a great move yeah because when I wanted to leave Consulting and those things were not not a problem right because I built a profile and built a reputation and a 100 million dollar business yeah and I think around that time I imagine you probably didn't have the scarcity that kicks in when you then start charging for your information because when you start charging for information you're well if I'm charging for it over here and I give it away over here it must devalue the thing that people are buying yeah but you didn't have that you just had the I'm in the trenches doing it I'm just going to share it because that means no less for me if the thing that I'm doing yeah yeah and it means I don't have the struggle story of when I started Consulting as well right my first monthly invoice 40 Grand yeah perfect because I was mentored by senior people who were you go into companies you tell them what to do you hope they listen and they pay your invoices every month yeah so was it so the Consulting Journey because that sounds it evolved really naturally you became really good in your industry you got head hunted from UK to New Zealand you Rose up the ranks there and then did that Consulting naturally go to in-person consultation where you're working with a team in person it's it's more corporate c-suite type stuff yeah corporate where I had a reputation as someone who was really comfortable sitting in a boardroom and talking the talk commercially right but also getting down on the trenches right because I'd worked in startups you had to be that you had to know how to run a Facebook ad yeah because there wasn't always someone there to do it but you also knew had to know how to talk about a 10 million budget yeah right so the two different skill sets in the end of the spectrum so I was quite used filters when some companies were going into the scrappy incubator stage we're going to start up lots of internal tests and start businesses inside where I go along and talk to them in corporate speak but also startup speak because they knew that I'd be happy to get my hand to roll my sleeves up and do stuff and so when you think back to that period was that a seamless transition was that something that came with reservations or fears there was any sense of imposter syndrome because I know working with people in the online space and it's different when you go from I'm using my Facebook for friends and family and then all of a sudden I'm a business coach and there's that element but going from being the person who got had a job was paying to do it to now teaching other people was there things you had to overcome was there a story you had to unravel what was that process for you to get started the biggest thing the biggest thing for me was a discipline of it because the work was so easy that I had to learn lots of things to Pat it out you know so there was a discipline of it of is this am I doing the right thing am I doing the right am I doing the right job because lots of people wouldn't even listen to the advice that I was giving them yeah right so then you start to have the moral questions around it but I I had the easiest start to Consulting ever because I consulted back to the company that I that I was formerly a marketing director right so it's struggle to get your first client we just signed the people you used to work with and then start adding clients from there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for four months too long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would walk me through it and something about the weekly coaching sessions that's a a relic of of old we've been together for an hour I drive to you you

there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for four months too long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would walk me through it and something about the weekly coaching sessions that's a a relic of of old we've been together for an hour I drive to you you drive to me we do it on Zoom whatever and making the decision you want to make but are too scared to make it yeah and seeking permission in some other way yeah so the big fear was leaving my first client but that's when I'm met a young Sam Evans young saying moments I love it all Circle back to him in a second because obviously he played a crucial role for both he did yeah but with you in the role that you're in then being able to consult yeah it sounds it's nice for you James but I have to you know get clients and I don't have that but also for you I imagine there was years behind the scenes you're kind of skimming over the fact that I imagine there was a lot of really deep skill set building throughout that time it wasn't just right place right time I could talk the talk I imagine there was the hours of podcasts the blogs the whatever it might be what did that process of building the skill set so the company that you worked for they still had to see enough value in what you did to want to pay you the money that you charged what was that process to build that skill set at work right I I developed a deep skill set across sales and marketing specifically by doing it yeah right in the in the train it's had Blue Chip sales Vodafone BMW and Xerox sales training which is Xerox sales training in Europe is considered to be the best sales training on earth right relationship building and those things from corporate Enterprise all the way down to selling phones in a shop yeah a Vodafone when I worked in there in New Zealand when I was a student and it's getting the skills on the and but also and I think I'm more ruthless about these days it's focusing on what you're good at because there's so much idealism around skill acquisition because everything's a skill yeah and it's and it's really okay double down on what you're good at and largely ignore the bits that you that you aren't and that's a tough lesson to learn I was a terrible people manager right and I inherited these teams and I didn't know what didn't know how to manage I'm gonna run ads guys it's going to be awesome yeah but I'd lean in on the commercials on the marketing on the detail of those things yeah and go back to them and the results will always take take you through you don't have to be the easiest person to work with yeah you don't even have to be liked but if you're effective you can go a really long way right so I think I always focused on things I was effective at and avoid it out of probably internal fear all the things I was I was I was proving to be bad at yeah which I think is also underrated I think too many people try to generalize too fast yeah I've shamed myself horribly for that over the years of no I should build a team yeah I should be a good manager I should be this I should be there and it doesn't matter how hard you wish for it if there's no true genuine desire there yeah it's very difficult to acquire skills when you don't have desire behind them yeah it's very difficult to wear I really want to be good at this and I need to be good at this when there's no actual want deep inside you to want to do it well well I think we'll come back to this but this idea that business needs to be hard is a really prevalent one because I think business is already hard because we have to grow and gain

. so he's based in New Zealand Consulting is is a side hustle and you get into this Dropbox community of there's some trainings there's no Consulting accelerator that many people would have experienced later yeah and what was that experience because because at this point I imagine you're still Consulting in person I was still Consulting in person and we moved to waiheke island off Auckland and so I was starting commuting and I was I've got a job again I've got a flipping job again right and because it was single source of income have to get up have to go to a place have to stay there have to come back and hop on a boat to get to Auckland boat yeah wait if anyone who doesn't know waiheke island is not connected via a bridge it's a 45 year 35 yes 35 minute Theory and it's a beautiful Lifestyle on there but then to have to go to the CBD or wherever you're going every day that was yeah it drained me real quick yeah and after having all those ideas sitting in my head and then that sub track playing in the background through podcasts and things of freedom and location Independence and digital nomadism I needed to do my own thing and so through Sam's course I launched my first product e-commerce engine and then we did a million and it was about 13 months yeah well yeah talk about timing as well unfair advantages back in the day when you could get leads for a dollar on Facebook and course 50 bucks yeah yeah but just got on the phone first price point was 2500 yeah then put it up to 6 Grand later so walk me through that process so you've got all this expertise you've built in person he tells you how to package it into a course or are you coaching one-to-one what does that look yeah the classic course with calls model that I call it now I had a Google drive folder with six modules in it and an introduction yeah a free Facebook group no sorry a Facebook group which is obviously free but paid for for clients yeah and then then a weekly call with what was it called on go to webinar oh goodness yeah 400 bucks a month at the time man yeah that's crazy yeah we don't know how good I'm done now it was great yeah and e-commerce them was really fragmented so it's pre-shopify so it was really people had all these different it wasn't pre-shopify but it was early it wasn't a big thing it is now the de facto solution for Ecom yeah so all these people had all these different platforms and the tech stuff was a bit of a nightmare yeah so to give them email templates and card abandoned sequences and conversion and Facebook ad templates it was a brand new thing at the time to that to that market it was what you give me stuff that works out of the box and I just go and copy and paste it and you help me modify it and I use it and it makes money yeah cool and so that was the most natural people for you to work with I guess having got come from grab one and Groupon yeah was you're now just in that e-commerce space you're not a coach helping coaches get clients it's you have an e-commerce store it's I've seen three billion dollars of e-commerce transactions flow past my herbals yeah so I was I know how to make people buy stuff online yeah so what was that learning curve going online the biggest learning curve was just the deployment of it because I thought I had to know all the tech and all those things the click funnels templates and that stuff yeah so that's all the stuff that that tripped me up sorry guys quick technical difficulty I had a camera that overheated we are back in the game so we're talking about you coaching online e-commerce and talking about the learning curve and so the biggest challenge for you at that time was the deployment they're getting the stuff done yeah going through all the steps yeah well it's the the stuff that you think you need that you don't really

.0 and then I sat there I thought about it and I was :41 am I becoming new Dan Bolton or am I becoming true Dan Moulton now funny play on words but for me what's really :47 interesting is if I think about who I was as an 18 year old I'm more reflective of the 18 year old now :54 and this season than I have been for the last five years because I deviated so far from the values of the vision that I :00 had for my life now this is of course not true at every age I can't look back at Dan Moulton at seven dead :06 multiple seven wanted to be a backup dancer in the Spice Girls 100 True got my mum to call the travel agents to :14 figure out how much it would cost to fly to the UK you took action you're an action taker The Action preseason :21 already believe in my ability to figure it out but when we look at overall I'm gonna make that dream come true for you one day I promise please bring back the :29 reunion when we look over the our lives there is so much breadcrumbs as :34 to who the true version of us is yeah definitely so Evolution we think about it in terms of the self-creation but :40 it's almost the self-discovery of the person that was always there I think Michelangelo carved David is that is that who :47 did it was it Leonardo da Vinci one of the one of the greats right he carved David out of the Rock and he said David was always there I just had to chip away :54 everything that was not him and and I think the process of evolution is almost that that it's not as if you :59 and I are blank slates right now and we go who do we want to be there's a level of freedom to that but it's almost who have we always been that we've :07 been ignoring this whole time the idea for me building my business around creation now dude I grew up :14 playing music all I wanted to do was play music as an adult that was the only thing I dreamed of doing was music drama :20 Then I then I spent almost a decade of my life where the main part of what I did was speaking and creating messages :26 yeah and then I started an ads agency and I was just an ad accounts all day and then I built a team and I was just :32 in meetings all day there was no point where I was this is the version of Dan that I feel I'm supposed to be I just lost sight of that and it's it's :40 so tough that it takes really low moments for us to get there but whatever :45 it takes for us to get there it's almost less about imagining and it's more about remembering :52 it's more about remembering the person we've always been and coming back to that the the interesting one story :58 I told recently was the pervasive childhood memory for me was Lego :03 so I would get Lego and I would assemble it and I'd immediately disassemble it and then make it into lots of different :10 things that were my own creations and it's interesting I'd done the same thing in business right I'd immediately :16 learned something and then disassemble it and make it slightly mine to get a result from it and I still do that to :22 this day that that innate okay there's a pattern here there's a system to follow :28 but in the process of building that system I think I've seen a better way to do it I'm going to do it on my own and :35 again I ignored that or so many times where I overplayed that as as a :41 one-trick pony of being I'm just going to be a derivative of that and it is largely remembering that find something :48 stand on the shoulders of giants but then in a from a creative sense down on the shoulder of :54 Giants and then choose choose
