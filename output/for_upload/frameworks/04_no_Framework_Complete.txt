## Audience Segmentation & Lead Generation coming down from that. There are people who will invest intermittently. . They might buy a program here, an event here, a short coaching course, here a mastermind, and come into a free period and come out. Those people, are there. They are valuable to you, and you are valuable to them on the journey, and I see a lot of people going and talking, or being coached by one of my friends, and then coming back to me, and then going away again to do something else. And and they we don't have a linear path, but they are in my world for months and years. and then we have everybody else who will buy things spasmodically. They'll buy things occasionally, or they'll buy one thing and never buy another thing. But they might stick around in your audience, and there might be people who a big advocate of you I've got. I can think of lots of scenarios and people who fit these criteria. And so traditional lead generation has just been a game of large numbers, feed a thousand people on the top, nurture them while each one drops off. Get 30 clients at the other end if you could. and it's pretty wasteful, and it's pretty inefficient, and over time as we're seeing now. And a lot of people, especially if you're selling money or transformation fitness coaching as well. It's just harder because there's more people doing it. There's more, there's more cynicism, there's more blindness in the market, and it's just harder to to. It's harder to get clients. It's harder to capture attention. It's harder to differentiate. And over time no systems that waste most of their output have stood the test of time.
