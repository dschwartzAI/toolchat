but but it's something that you have to work through right you said earlier Simplicity comes through complexity yeah right oftentimes it we have to go through the complex and the hard to get to the simple and the easy yeah so when you launched right circling back you were coaching on e-commerce you're working with slick Sam ovens you're going through his course you said you did a million and 13 months you obviously didn't stay in that Niche although that business model without going through the linear journey of every six months how did it change and what it looked you've evolved tons there has been so many different twists and turns you've you've had the good and the bad I have I'll never forget being a manly and the business that you had then was so radically different and so not a fit for you at that time compared to the business that why hiki James was crushing and cranking 18 months earlier and so when you think about going from e-commerce to the next Market to the next offer obviously there are metrics I don't so much want to focus on the an offer gets tired a funnel gets tired and so we launch something new but what is that Journey looked and felt for you in it was it a reflection of your personal growth was it that you were growing as a human being and all of a sudden the old business model didn't feel it fit what did that what did the evolution of the business models in the last six to eight years look and feel for you autistic no seriously I say it with a smile on my face but I'm a highly sensitive person and so my journey was mimicking the things I was paying attention to or the mentors of the people persons of esteem or authority that I was looking at at the time yeah and then I was just becoming derivatives of them right I'm a successful mimic which is again a challenging place because I was really good at mimicking because I could make it effective by just tweaking it enough to make it my own and then the feedback loop will be successful you can make a million dollars a year great but I topped out at two because I couldn't mimic my way through the next curve because I didn't want to because I was mimicking someone else's life and business model and even probably personality sometimes that wasn't mine right so I capped out because I I was playing a role that I needed to play and then the internet in terms of the the thing that I thought people saw of me of a brand then trapped me in it well I have to keep pretending I really want to do this because I've got people paying me money to play this character on the internet so hindsight it was just mimicry just really successful mimicry and there's a huge benefit to modeling but memory will always run you into the wall because mimicry gets you so close to the person's personality beliefs and those things that it's always going to challenge what you believe and who you really are it's such a subtle but important difference the idea of modeling versus mimicking yeah I was talking to Dylan who runs all of our content and I was dude the things that we're trying to do right now have already been done we don't have to get Innovative and creative and go we're pioneering something it's dude let's look at garyvee let's look at the people that have been way ahead of where we are and let's at least start modeling what they're doing what I'm not saying is let's take their top 10 thumbnails and go these are owls now right I'm just going how do they shoot what angles what does it look how what is that documenting versus creating process look but mimicking is interesting because I I would say I I have have had both past and prison massive dad issues right yeah so I think a lot of coaching for me was Finding guys that held some mentorship place in my life that I could then hook my horse to their carriage and go I'm gonna follow this person I'm going to become more this person

these are owls now right I'm just going how do they shoot what angles what does it look how what is that documenting versus creating process look but mimicking is interesting because I I would say I I have have had both past and prison massive dad issues right yeah so I think a lot of coaching for me was Finding guys that held some mentorship place in my life that I could then hook my horse to their carriage and go I'm gonna follow this person I'm going to become more this person and that served me really well in some instances where I'm I don't think I ever got the blue blazer in the in the New York apartment Sam but but there was that sense of I would listen to how Sam thought or talked and I would go oh I'm too expressive I need to be more thoughtful I need to be more structured he was he was churning out 13 hour days and then planning tomorrow today and doing all these different things and I would try them and it would be wearing someone else's clothes yeah and and yet there's so much value and modeling and so how do you think about it now having gone through the The Good the Bad and the Ugly because you and I still work with coaches and we learn from people I think these days I need to pay people less to get clean from them there are people I've never paid that I listen to their staff or there's a guy called Zane Lowe love is interviews he's in the music space he's mentoring me and away from afar but how do you think about that idea of modeling and mentorship now as opposed to the mimicking you were doing how what's a healthy version of that look for you now this comes back to the reality of my life and the consequences piece which is I'm a full-time dad and I don't have any time so I have to have constraints I have to design from constraints and when you are when you're mimicking you design From Desire or want to be that person or have the things that you perceive them to have I can no longer do that because I have to have constraints of it so I have to design from a place of I need to design my model based on the reality of what I see around me which is my kids and and the other things that are immediately important so it's been a force change that I have to do those things because time is scarce energy is scarce so I have to choose a model which works for me and there is no compromise on that because there's too many consequences of compromising and I think when you mimic there's much less social there's more social because people always find you out right yeah they always go you're just so and so you're just well the market the market doesn't reward you after a time because you're are you them or you this so you just it's it's not good business sense because you end up being everybody else in competition kills the prophets so I think about models now much more from a way of I have to do this and this way to preserve these things because the consequence consequence of me not doing attitude and I think one of the things I've learned is if you take advice the what or the how from someone with a different why you can end up building a business that becomes more a prison and less and less the how often do we see that oh dude this is what's fascinating is that most of the most popular entrepreneurial figures in our space who give the best the seemingly best business advice have completely different goals from the 99 watching them so when you're watching someone who is trying to get into the upper echelon of any human financially in all of history and you're trying to make 10 000 a month they might have great advice but it's coming from a different place and some of that advice is not for you because you have different goals yeah if you're already a millionaire versus a billionaire I don't think people understand the the complete different Stratosphere that lives in I think the stat is well

# only the Framework

## Overview

The only the is a comprehensive framework for business transformation.

## Complete Framework

how do you do that how do you do that in a way that's applicable to me and and then living there I ran a workshop the other day and it was I started with all the principles I started with how I think about things and where I come from and some very complicated thanks it wasn't hyper tactical and I'm Unapologetic about that they're I want to teach you the principles so you don't need me right I don't want trauma bonds and codependency with clients right if you want to be I got enough of my own I don't need any more of them so so I come from a place of I I don't want you to need me and that I think in terms of paying attention to people who are doing it that way and then paying attention to how I'm doing it and if those things sync up then I'm generally on the right track what and I think it's the reason why we haven't recorded these conversations I think the primary reason is we know that it would slightly distort and dilute some of the things we say and some of the angles we have yeah because there's a performative element in all human nature yeah I'm trying to I'm struggling to get comfortable in this chair I'm I'm normally raising you directly we tumble ideas around and we we know each other's lives very very well in terms of the bigger picture I you won't even hear when I arrived I'm sitting in there chatting to live in the and the boys and those things and checking out the chickens yeah those relationships are they're Priceless and valuable to me because it's I know you yeah I know the I know the business Dan I your posts on Facebook and watch your videos sometimes yeah on double speed yeah there we go but who's the person yeah what are they doing what's their values what do they believe and we're going to change along the way because stuff happens that you never you never see coming well I think this is the interesting piece around this the space that we play in right online coaching Consulting marketing this Creator economy whatever we want to call it we've seen it drastically evolve right you could have a funnel yeah and that was it maybe you would have a few posts on your Facebook page so someone clicked on your ad you didn't look a ghost but we were taught a model that worked really well which was you run an ad to a stranger they click on a landing page the landing page is a big promise you you enter your details you come through the video there's a rags to riches story there's a problem there's a solution there's an invite to a call one in 20 people book the call and then one in five people close yeah right and that can still work to a degree but one of the things that I'm seeing is the era of the personal brand is is upon us it is we're we're content is now a filtering mechanism to go is this my person because in 2016 if you're a consultant struggling with your clients you were desperate for Solutions and there were very few around right Sam Evans pops up in your feeding goes how to get 42 clients in 69 days or whatever it might be I can't remember his hook and it was it was new it was fresh I didn't do how we're going to get clients automated now there are so many people who say the exact same things as us and we think if we just outspend them in ads if we just out funnel them out follow up then we're going to win but the reality is is that people are looking for depth with us I think now because they realize it's it wasn't business to business business to Consumer it's human to human and now that there is ample competition and there's red ocean right it's about now that that saying I heard Kevin Kelly say recently it's don't be the best be the only the model if you always just be the best right it was just how do you make the biggest claim how do you run the best

going to win but the reality is is that people are looking for depth with us I think now because they realize it's it wasn't business to business business to Consumer it's human to human and now that there is ample competition and there's red ocean right it's about now that that saying I heard Kevin Kelly say recently it's don't be the best be the only the model if you always just be the best right it was just how do you make the biggest claim how do you run the best ads and now it's how do you create a connection that no one else can replicate because it's you connecting with someone else yeah and I was talking to a client yesterday and he he sits up really quiet he said the best decision I've made in the last year of my business was hiring you but I hired you different to every other coach you've ever worked with every other coach I worked with was I had a problem and they had a solution I asked myself before I hired you do I want to become more Dan and because I answered yes I've worked with you and it's been amazing because you're taking more more in the direction of the person I want to become not just the I'm a square Pig and that's a square hole and and so I think that's a really fascinating Nuance to this whole conversation because I think there are a lot of creators and consultants and coaches stuck in the old model that if I can just out Market if I can do a launch or a five-day challenge without creating real deep intimacy with the audience they get stuck they can't outspend the fact that the people just don't trust them the way they used to what do you think people should be thinking about whether it's doing a podcast whether it's writing posts on Facebook how do you think about cultivating that sense of a personal brand now as opposed to you you're one funnel away yeah I think something that I've got clients do recently doing is writing intention documents for themselves to to a piece of self-discovery that gets down to what they really want and what is enough and not being shamed around that an industry where everything's seven figures this and seven figures that people coming back with six-figure goals that they internally shame themselves for that despite that being profoundly impactful on them and and have constraints around it right yeah and then in many cases they've shared those intention documents With Their audience people want to know who you're becoming right they want to know where you're going because the true north only now is the person behind it and we've understood that this filter of the Internet is just as as can apply a filter that people can say and and do anything at the time but unless they're unless you're very clear about who you're becoming and who you're following then that same mimic and sensitivity that that I fell victim to in a successful Financial way is going to come to fruition because they they've followed they've already got experience following people that they didn't want to become doing things that they didn't want to do and they were attracted by The Glitz and now they want to know who are you where do you think you're going and I'm okay with you reserving the right to change your mind as long as these basic principles and these these values are are still consistent yeah because that's all people want they just want consistency with those things yeah they don't want the rug pulled from under them say oh it was all a scam and it was all morally ambiguous and they don't really have those values that's why we that's why we look at when people get caught doing things that are underhanded who have a a high moral standing in society we have that look yeah because if you undermine certain values then you can never be trusted again it's funny because again it comes back to that idea of we give people credibility where they haven't earned it based on status yeah this is funny in crypto right it's people were surprised that crypto rug pulls happen yeah and it's you trusted this person because
