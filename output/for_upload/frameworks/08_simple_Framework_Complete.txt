## Complete Framework

. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** Recurring revenue is a mirage. It only recurs in hindsight. Many in the coaching and consulting space believe they have recurring revenue businesses, but they have long-duration products on payment plans. This is a crucial distinction. The only real money is *now* money – cash in the bank. Upfront payments create a delivery liability. The 20k you accept for 12 months of work is a delivery obligation. Smart businesses balance assets and liabilities. Clients are assets, and we generate yield by delivering agreed value. To grow revenue, we grow the asset: increase clients, client value, or client lifetime. My definition of recurring revenue is revenue that showed up in the past. I'll show you revenue that has recurred. I'll take you into the future so you can build a model that generates recurring revenue when you look back. ## The Power of Weekly Pricing **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for weekly pricing over monthly, highlighting its benefits in terms of increased sales, higher annual revenue, client flexibility, and reduced churn. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** I've found weekly pricing superior to monthly. Objectively, it has a lower "now" number, increasing sales. It generates 8.5% more annually due to 13 four-week blocks in a year. Subjectively, it's more dynamic. Clients feel more flexibility with adding/removing products and payments. It's simpler to upsell, downsell, and minimize churn as investment decisions are more immediate. I cut churn by 80% when I implemented a community level at a lower price, as people downgraded rather than left completely. ## The Simple-Complex Stack for Recurring Revenue **Summary:** James Kemp introduces the simple-complex stack, a strategy for creating a series of offers that address the increasing complexity clients experience as they implement simple initial promises, ensuring continued client engagement and recurring revenue. Video Source:* Recurring.txt **Content:** If we make things simple for clients, our offer is simple to sell. But even simple processes are individually complex. I make it simple to create a $3,000 offer. The complexity comes in the execution. Some people sell immediately, others take months. We take people through a simple-complex axis. Simple: "I'll create a $3,000 offer with you." Complex: "How do I sell it?" Simple: "I'll create it for you (Fastlane)." Complex: "It's hard to make $3k/week consistently." Simple:
