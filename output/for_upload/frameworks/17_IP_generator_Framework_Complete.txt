. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems. But don't go over the top. James Kemp: and with pricing is there a clear roi? Have you made it easy to get started? And I've done that by giving you the prescriptions of the pricing? James Kemp: And does your price factor in the cost of inaction? Have you just made it really easy to get started as the primary model? And again. this. I'm laboring this because it's a massive failure point. James Kemp: No one wants to watch 54 videos and intend 10 h of calls a week the better the client, and, the more money they have, the less time they have James Kemp: right, because more offers fail because they are indigestible rather than Lane James Kemp: telling people what's in it., all the things they get is more likely to kill demand than enhance it. Again, it's a common failure point that I see in products and offers that people are talking about all the stuff they get. James Kemp: and in and a desire to overwhelm them with value. James Kemp: And it's lazy, because if you have a clear promise and a plan, people don't need to know all the value you you deliver, they just need to get, be clear about it, so they can say yes and get started. James Kemp: So is to get some examples to bring these things together. Your next task is to construct an offer using a simple Google Doc James Kemp: syndicate folks, 95% of you should have one right now. So the reason we use a Google Doc as far as it's fast to create James Kemp: and to share and to modify. And it's most useful to demonstrate James Kemp: by examples. And I've got a template for you here as well. James Kemp: so this is an example from Jason and Janine. James Kemp: and it talks clearly about the promise James Kemp: and the plan. So the promise is. James Kemp: do you want support for me, and my incredible, incredible community can install a system that can can James Kemp: consistently attracts 5 prospects every month, securing at least one high value client every single month on your terms with the visibility you deserve, and without becoming stuck in the frustration of being the best kept secret. James Kemp: so clearly, clearly, clearly articulates what happens right? It uses numbers. It uses currency to clearly say. James Kemp: this is what's going to happen. This is what you get, and these are things you can point at James Kemp: it clearly, says that it's a 12 month program. but then it comes into over the next 6 weeks. James Kemp: and it talks about the plan will develop your client roadmap so you can. So you are faster. James Kemp: So your laser focused on who you work with. And more importantly, they'll want to work with you right? James Kemp: Then we install your product roadmap James Kemp: very clear. No cuteness. Just the client roadmap, the product roadmap, and then the IP generator system. James Kemp: So it's a great example James Kemp: of being very, very clear about the promise and the plan. and again distilling it down and removing any superfluous bits around the core. Right? Everything else in there is a benefit James Kemp: but the core James Kemp: clearly clearly articulated in the promise as something desirable, and the plan that future paces people to go through. James Kemp: This is what sales offers. James Kemp: If someone is clear that those are the things they want, and they agree with the plan. James Kemp: they are very, very, very likely to want to get started when the price meets the expectation. James Kemp: and again the pricing I've given you, will meet the expectation
