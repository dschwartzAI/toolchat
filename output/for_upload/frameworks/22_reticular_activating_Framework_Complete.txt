# reticular activating Framework

## Overview

** James Kemp advises against being wishy-washy and trying to please everyone, emphasizing the importance of a tight plan that allows people to easily say yes or no.

## Complete Framework

The promise is short-term, the vision is long-term. ## Being True to Your Fans and Embracing Discernment **Summary:** James Kemp advises against being wishy-washy and trying to please everyone, emphasizing the importance of a tight plan that allows people to easily say yes or no. He also discusses the concept of true fans and their unwavering loyalty. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Where I've been straying is not being true to the true fans. The tighter your plan, the easier it is for people to say yes or no. Most people build their business to please everyone. They're constantly thinking, "What does the market want?" Most people don't know what they want. We are articulating ideals and demonstrating. It's the handholds. "This is interesting, or this is relevant." The reticular activating system, the yellow car thing. Sack yourself. Create raving fans. The true fans are the true fans. a footy team, you don't change teams. Offers and content are invitations to pay attention. The best offers are binary. Easy yes or no. The best content is binary. Popular people have detractors because they're individualistic. You can't scale things you don't care about. The coaching industry talks about scaling volume, not scaling care. ## Distributing Your Plan and Building Trust Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp recommends sharing your plan across all platforms, regardless of whether it's a personal or business profile. He also discusses building trust and relationships through content, emphasizing total attention time and the number of insights consumed. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Should I share my plan from a personal Facebook profile or a business page? As long as you're in it, it doesn't matter. Put your plan everywhere. People can refer back to it. Is there a best content format for building trust? It's hitting the four points and letting them consume. Total attention time. People binge my content before calls. They need to consume a certain amount to get enough insight. A 20-minute YouTube video might have 7,000 words, which is about 30 emails. Both convert, but total consumption time varies. With video, you move people faster because they consume at a higher rate. We're chasing a certain number of insights. 10 insights could come from 10 Facebook posts or one YouTube video. ## Identifying Barriers to Buying and Removing Them Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of identifying barriers to buying and using content to remove those barriers. He emphasizes the value of offer creation and how it can accelerate client acquisition and retention. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** When people buy, what conditions have they met? There are natural barriers to buying. I focus on offer creation. If I help people create an offer before they become clients, I can quickly tweak it to increase their earnings. They've already done the groundwork. They think I'm a genius, but they did the work. I know what moves the needle. Getting an offer beforehand makes them more likely to become and stay a client. We've already created momentum. What do they need to get results? What do you need to give them so they see they can get the result, but are better off with you? If your content proves they're looking at a barrier the wrong way, that's insight. If it shows they have what they need but don't know how to use it, that's insight. Insight removes barriers. ## Simplifying Offers and Embracing a Scarcity Mindset **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for small, easy-to-digest offers with fewer barriers. He criticizes the scarcity mindset of withholding help and suggests aiming to help people, which naturally leads to client acquisition. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I talk about small promises

## Overview

So they're, they're just, they're just the trends and the, and the spectrum that just moves along as people go through it.

## Complete Framework

. So they're, they're just, they're just the trends and the, and the spectrum that just moves along as people go through it. But fame has always been the most efficient business model. Yeah. It's just got a shitload of trade-offs around it that, that, that potentially need to be managed. Yeah, a hundred percent. Should we talk about ai? I know you've been doing some stuff with it. I've been going deep., it's, it's obviously a topic on everyone's minds., I'll just preface this by saying I see the market, our, our community. Let's just talk about the people in this room. I imagine a lot of people are split, they're either not doing anything with it or they're doing way too much., I talk to clients sometimes and they have a very clear bottleneck in their funnel, and they're, yeah man, I've just been spending last week creating an AI bot that replies to people's comments on my Facebook post. And I'm, brother in Christ, that is not worth doing., this is not a problem to solve. And so I think, it, finding how to leverage this in such a way that it's beneficial that it moves the needle is very, very challenging. I feel I'm finding more of a sweet spot. What have, what have you been working on ai and more specifically, how do you, how are you thinking about it now for businesses ours? I'm, I'm thinking of rather than, the conversation around the AI reminds me of the conversation, and I'm old enough to remember this about marketing automation. When marketing automation first came out, and believe it or not, it hasn't existed forever. When marketing automation first came out, people were, I'm gonna automate everything. And what people did was they automated s****y process. So there's this, I'm gonna automate all these emails, but they were s**t emails. I'm gonna automate this, this, this web flow. But it was a, it was a s****y flow. And so AI's the same, is that it's only as good as the things you feed it, right? And so people have tried to delegate work to AI rather than taking the time to understand what work needs to be created. So I'll give you, I'll give you an example about how, how I think about it. If someone starts working with me, the, the, the, the central pillar of what we need is a, is a good offer, right? And a good offer is only the one that's validated and responded to by the marketplace., their marketplace in general. That in that initial time, if we're starting from scratch, or even if we're doing something that will take seven to 14 days to get something, unless someone's a hyper action taker, something that is market ready and valid, validation. So there's a lag time between getting in the market and, and learning that is just filled with work labor. The most important thing is if the market responds to it. So you've got a minimum viable offer that you need to put in the market and get a response from. We know that if we have best, even with best practices, we need all these things to do it. And then the market responds. So how I think about it, if an AI tool can get that MVP in five minutes rather than 10 days, then we spend the, the, the time that we have saved learning about the offer in the marketplace where, where, where it matters, right? We can sit there and f*****g go through the Google Doc and pick out words and those things we don't really know until it hits the market. Mm-hmm. We don't really, really know much. We've got a good guess, but that, that's the best as we can do
