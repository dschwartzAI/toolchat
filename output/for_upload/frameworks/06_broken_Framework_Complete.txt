# broken Framework - Complete Guide & DarkJK Framework - Complete Guide

# broken Framework

## Overview

The broken is a comprehensive framework for business transformation.

## Complete Framework

Don't automate a broken process - Don't expand before you have product-market fit
## The DarkJK Method
### Phase 1: Diagnose - Identify the real bottleneck (it's usually not what you think) - Look at the numbers, not the stories - Find the 20% causing 80% of problems
### Phase 2: Simplify - Strip away everything non-essential - Focus on one core offer - Master one traffic source
### Phase 3: Execute - Daily consistent action beats sporadic bursts - Track leading indicators, not just results - Adjust based on data, not feelings
### Phase 4: Scale - Only scale what's already working - Systems before people - Profit margins matter more than revenue
## Tough Love Truths
1. Your business problems are usually your personal problems in disguise 2. If you're not embarrassed by your first version, you launched too late 3. Nobody cares about your business as much as you do (and that's okay) 4. The market is always right, even when it seems wrong 5. Cash flow is the only scorecard that matters ## Action Steps for Every Coaching Session
1. What specific action will you take this week? 2. How will you measure success? 3. What's the deadline? 4. What will you sacrifice to make this happen? 5. What's your accountability plan?
Remember: **Advice without action is just entertainment.**
