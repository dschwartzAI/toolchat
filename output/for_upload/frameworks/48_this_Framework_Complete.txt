. James Kemp: So get people to a no James Kemp: right? Is it a timing thing? Is the price thing? Is it a is it a promise thing? Is it a clear? Is it a clear piece. James Kemp: a clarity thing? What makes fun? What questions do they ask James Kemp: again? Clear is kind, clear, is kind to yourself and Clear is kind in office. James Kemp: What questions do they ask? If your offer is unclear, they will ask questions about it. What questions? Don't they ask? James Kemp: What's missing from it? Do they understand? James Kemp: And are they feeling the pain? And are they acutely aware of the problem as you made the assumption that they have. James Kemp: So at the stage of off-value, validation, activity, and action James Kemp: always trump perfection and procrastination. And a few people again, recently have kindly shared. They're working through of that perfection and procrastination, constantly tweaking the offer, Doc, and not sending it to people James Kemp: constantly procrastinating, saying, I don't have enough leads, or it's the wrong time of year. There's always a reason not to do it. So put an action plan in place. James Kemp: follow up with 5 people every day. Cold, outreach 10 people every day, this is easier for some people than others. James Kemp: Put 3 pieces of content out into the into the world every week to start conversations. Who interacts with those who can you speak to. James Kemp: the Internet has removed all excuses of our ability to connect with other people. It has never been easier to connect with other people. We just need to connect and have a conversation in a contextual way. James Kemp: So create a plan? Who you gonna out, reach out to in the next 14 days? What assets can you utilize to validate sooner rather than later? What daily tasks are non negotiable to have those conversations. James Kemp: So James Kemp: Conrad message me yesterday, and said. Hey, I've I've got about 20 people that that stopped that stopped at different times of the year that I'm not currently working with. James Kemp: shall I? We've we've come up with a mastermind offer. Shall I make that offer to them. And I'm, Yeah, it's a good time to do it. Right. Message 20 people, 3 people in the course of a day converted into a mastermind for multiple thousands of dollars, people that just popped into his head James Kemp: that he'd stopped working with at a particular time, that he messaged and outreached James Kemp: because he has an offer that he knows that if he puts it in front of people James Kemp: it will get them to take action or get them. A no, and a lot of those people will say, no, not right now. Maybe next year I'm doing this in January. Maybe I'll readdress this in march, they'll give them the future. James Kemp: So James Kemp: it isn't. It is critically important not only to intellectualize and get the insights and creating office fun and the feelings of clarity that you get going through this process James Kemp: our people can attest to how enjoyable that is when you start to get clear about your offer. James Kemp: but it only turns into something when the rubber hits the road and get it out to other people. James Kemp: So make a plan and do it. James Kemp: Who has questions. I'm going to drop the doc James Kemp: and the template. julie williams: I have a question, James. James Kemp: fire away, Julie. julie williams: Okay, I'm gonna get to the guts of what I feel my hesitation is. And taking this forward

convert them into prospects yeah so it's it's a bottleneck analysis as the :41 the first major hire if you because the virtual assistant is relatively easy to find you might go through two or three but the biggest thing I see :49 with virtual assistant is the Rel L inexpensive in the world that we're in and people are I don't have enough :54 work for them to do and you're you said the average virtual assistant :00 30 minutes an hour a day you're paying them to sit around for six or seven hours a day if they're full-time dedicated to you yeah but the relative :07 cost of that at 20 to 30 bucks a day is very very low yeah so at the :12 beginning people need to accept that someone sitting on the bench and they're under utilizing them but utilize them in :17 the future but your 30 minutes is worth more than their whole day yeah also delegation is a muscle you build it up :23 another skill everything's a skill oh man when I first got started with a virtual assistant I would be doing :28 things that the virtual citiz should be doing even when I had one because I kept forgetting that I could delegate it now :34 I got I I realized two platforms this morning had my old profile pictures I :39 didn't log in and change them it was a voice message hey can you change my School Community thing and my cly :46 profile photos to the Facebook one thanks now it's just a muscle so a really helpful framework that I :53 remember learning when I was hiring this and building this stupidly big team was from Ari misel and do AR's :00 story no so AR runs this I don't know what he does now but he used to run something called the replaceable founder :08 and his story was he built this business and then he got Crohn's disease and it got only work 1 hour a day so became efficiency productivity machine :15 when you're hiring let's say you figure out the bottleneck right so you look at appointment hitting you're spending too many times and too much :21 time in the DMS you go through this process called o a o optimize automate :28 Outsource right so the key is you optimize first you go is this thing that :34 I'm doing yeah is it important should it be getting done yeah is this :39 a later thing is this now thing all that stuff you filter it through is there a better way that I can be doing this to make it just as impactful :45 and less time all of that stuff automate oh this is a freaking super important question now in the age of AI :52 cuz now you're having things copyrighting and video editing and all those things where it previously it was :57 I need videos edited post a job now it's there is an AI for that that can take your podcast and edit it up and :04 then Outsource and the the point being your first response to overwork or :09 overwhelm should not be I'll go hire someone if you're going to hire someone it should be this refined focused super :16 Crystal Clear role your job is this this is how many hours they think it's going to be and I think the mistake that I've :23 made is right now I'm making more profit with a team of two than when I had a :28 team of 13 yeah and so the idea of you just keep adding people in and we'll figure it out on the way or hiring for :34 growth right is typically a stupid model when you figure out what the botnick is figure out is it a :41 botnick at all or you just going through a busy week then going through o a o o I think is really really key so right now :48 do you have any team at all what one yeah Alex VA right all round VA super :54 superstar cool right now I have a VA and a Content guy what's up sh up and :01 and I'm going

. Yeah. And the, we are making so much stuff. Even if you are not, even if you don't have that many clients right now, even if you are, you are making hours of stuff right now. Yeah. A hundred percent., one of the last things I wanna finish up with is on messaging and content and sharpening your content. Mm. I think the best content reads, you are walking through someone's day. So I'll give you an example. When we say things, and I want everyone to think about their own offer and their own niche here for a second, oftentimes we we generalize people's struggles, which dehumanizes their experience. I'm gonna say that again. Oftentimes we generalize people's struggles, which means we de human their dehumanize their experience. So what that looks is, if, if we are working in a market where someone is not getting leads, what do we say, ah, you're struggling to get leads, but what does that practically look for them? If you were to, as the old marketing quote says, enter into the conversation happening in their minds, then maybe you might say something, you wake up on Monday to another week of no sales calls booked. And I've just come up, I came up with this framework a few weeks, a few days ago, sorry, of this idea of surface signals that, that it, it's not the problem, but it's the symptom. And when you can articulate the symptom really, really well, if you can articulate it well enough, people will assume how to solve it. Sam Ovens was world class at this. Someone asked him, how is it that your funnel, your webinar has made $50 million? And he said, it's because I know exactly what happens in my ideal client's day from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to sleep. And so when you think about your ideal clients, and I've been really workshopping this through all of my messaging through sales pages, VSL, offer doc, do not generalize where you can get specific. So don't say, not getting enough leads or, you're not sell, you're not getting enough clients. It's, you just got, you just got back from a sales conversation and you've got another, you got another, let me think about it. Right? That's real. People can feel that. Or you've been checking Stripe a crack addict and still nothing's coming through. You're trying to find that visceral sense of emotion where people feel seen. And then on the flip side, what is the transformation that you offer? What does that look on the other side? Well, you wake up on Monday with, with three to five calendar, three to five sales calls already booked on your calendar with dream prospects. So instead of just saying, we go from no leads to leads, from no calls to calls, you try and, make it more specific, make it more real. And I, I've just observed for this, when, when I really focus in on this, people think that I'm speaking directly to them, right? When, when I was a preacher and we would speak on stage, the best compliment you could ever get is someone says, man, it felt, it felt you're speaking just to me. And the best content creates that connection. And so just this idea of pain signals, what are the signals and the symptoms that they're experiencing, how does that show up in their life that shows that they're stuck or misaligned or not where they wanna be? Right? Then dream signals. What are the things they want to feel? What do they want their calendar to look ? What do they want their life to feel ? And the more specific you can get it, when you disappear from the, the general, you're not losing weight
