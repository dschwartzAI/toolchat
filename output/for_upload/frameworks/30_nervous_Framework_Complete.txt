# nervous Framework

## Overview

of something and I barely even look at it.

## Complete Framework

. I, I talked to a mutual friend yesterday and I was, how's the, the, the mastermind going? And he is, oh yeah, two people joined. One of them, has been following me for two years and the other one for three. And I talked about someone who came to Bali a while ago and who hadn't bought a single thing off me but started following me four years ago. Right? Right. And it's, what can you be consistent at and how do you, how do you produce? We have to produce something to put out into the world, but how do you produce, I think, then dictates how you show up and what strategies you use rather than trying to be an imitation of somebody else., it'd be crazy to try and do daily email me if you haven't written every day for half your life, right. When people weren't reading it or weren't watching I was writing. And so by choosing and discerning what you are consistent at and what you can do for a long time, I think, I think forms the choices you make in terms of the strategy because then you then at the end of that, that's amplifying. Yeah. Yeah. I'll, I'll piggyback on that 'cause I think that's really connected to one of the biggest lessons that I've, I've, been thinking about and, and feeling. And you said something that's interesting and I want to challenge it, but you probably will agree as well, which you said, our philosophies on front end products are different, but my philosophy is this, if I did what you did, I'd make more money if I combine that with what I was doing. Right?, moving people to workshops, running workshops regularly, making office consistently, all that totally works. So, so, so philosophy wise, alignment. However, I would sooner want to punch myself in the face than write daily emails. Hmm. And so this is the key thing that I keep thinking about is, it is that true aspect of, everything works and we have to find the thing that feels, what's that saying? It's the thing that feels play to you but looks work to others. Yeah. So I feel that around video, right? I feel really, really light around content creation when I, if I'm allowed to create whatever I want to create, and it just so happens I want to create really often. But if I held myself to a standard, if I have a content calendar and today is, today is pain 0.371, why sales calls, suck., I would, I would quit this business because it feels the business would be telling me what to do. That sounds horrible. And I think there's this really deep sense of something more going on with models where we can talk about it on a surface level perspective of what works or what seems effective. And so, we'll take this for example. Everyone here should have a focus of having something that someone can consume before they get to your offer or your pitch or your sales conversation. You'll make more money the more of your stuff that people consume, right? That's, that's my core, belief around that. However, it has, the way you do it has to feel light to you. And I think, and I'll be interested to know what you think and have observed with this, James. I think there's this whole conversation around the nervous system that most of us are not having, which is that most of us choose models that, that we are choosing because it is the most effective way, right? This is the best funnel of 2025. The problem is, is that it leaves us feeling disregulated, misaligned, everything feels heavy. We feel we are constantly stuck in first gear, can't get momentum because that isn't how we're wired. That isn't what we are here to do

. The problem is, is that it leaves us feeling disregulated, misaligned, everything feels heavy. We feel we are constantly stuck in first gear, can't get momentum because that isn't how we're wired. That isn't what we are here to do. If you are a more creative type, there are so many business models that will absolutely crush you because it'll be, cool, just fill out your numbers 37 times a day and find out what the bottleneck is in the funnel. Where when people ask me what my numbers are, I'm, I have no idea. I get, I get a message from my VA once a week just giving me the summary of something and I barely even look at it. For me, it's much more intuitive. It's more about feeling, it's more about how much I'm enjoying the business. People will ask me, Hey, what you are doing this wait list thing?, is this more effective than this? And I'm, please don't copy me. 'cause I don't care how many clients I get, I'm just optimizing for fun. Talk to me about what you've observed with this, with your own journey coming into this year and the start of this year around this whole idea of, I'm putting words in your mouth, but nervous system, the thing below the thing where it's not this strategy works or this strategy works tuning into what feels best for you. Yeah. I, I make the most money when I'm have the most constraints and said another way I make the most money when I work the least, right? Because the, the non negotiables of I'm gonna turn up on calls three times a week are in, and everything else is, is is vibe in terms of optional. And so that, that the white space enhances the creativity. The creativity. If it's natural and innate and it's emerging, then it's fun. And the more fun it is, the more it's consumed and the more it's consumed, the more people are attracted to it. And the more people are attracted to it, the more people buy stuff. Yeah. Right. There's a question there. What if it feels light? But Maybe I saw that. I was, we gotta go after this Question. it's, i semantics matter a lot and discernment is, def is defining things for yourself and effective is not what James says or what Dan says. It's what is effective for you and what does the, the, the business should serve you. Right? And if it serves you, then it's effective. If it serves you, it probably serves others. And the internet allows us to find who the others are. And this is the, the inversion of the idea of that I, I think the assumption is effective means it makes money, Right? Whereas making money is a byproduct of value creation. And value creation as a byproduct of values and values are a byproduct of alignment of you being aligned with the thing that you're making and then the then this, then it comes at the end. Mm-hmm. Whereas the inversion that most people have is, I'm doing this because it makes money. And so the tightness is the only effective measure is money. Why do I hate it? Well, the the question answers itself because the only effective measure is money, but no value is being created because you don't value it. I'm just closing my window because the boys are just hopping on the trampoline., I think this is a huge lesson because I believe that the worst version of yourself that you can give anyone else is the one of you that's living under obligation. So I want you to really think about this from a pragmatic standpoint for everyone on this call. You follow James and you go, I'm gonna write a daily email because that's what he tells me to do

# lovely Framework

## Overview

The lovely is a comprehensive framework for business transformation.

## Complete Framework

you can't go straight from broke to meaning you have to make money right you can't be trying to pay the bills and also trying to impact the world it doesn't work you have to so anyway all that it say things happen in sequence so if we're talking about the foundational things and let's talk about someone's first offer yeah because either they're at 10K a month and they only have one offer and it sucks and it's not scalable or it's not attractive or you're at 50k a month and you've been in the game for a while and you've got 17 offers if someone was to come to you and they're going I want to get to 100K a month in a way that's profitable in a way that scales in a way that I but that clients get results all those things what would be that main offer because it might be we can get into the multiple offers you might have an offer stack or a hybrid offer to get to 100K month but what would be that main offer that you would encourage the average person to build out to lay that Foundation to build a seven figure business so the average person everyone needs momentum but the average person needs momentum the most and the thing that gets the most momentum in an offer is around the refining the promise or refining what gets done what's the outcome of going to be that so if you're if you're selling money which is getting someone to 100K a month Etc you need to say that's our goal and that's what we're going to do M if you're selling time then or you're selling better life then you need to be exquisitly clear about how you articulate what the outcome is on the other side because as soon as you can inject the frame of what's going to happen when that person with that person over the next weeks months maybe year then your offer becomes a lot easier to buy because I think we've both said this recently most people have enough leads if you're at if you're at 10K a month you have enough leads to get to 30k a month you just need a refinement around the promise and what you're doing and in many cases it's refining it down to something making small promises that are much easier to keep rather than making bigger and having promise inflation so I always look around what gets done here in the offer what what are they what are they promising you know and metaphorically in terms of sometimes the literal promise I will get you there we can talk about guarantees but I will get you there and this is where we're going and refining that round so it's much more clear so they they see a bump in conversions because most people have enough leads and if you get the promise right then those leads are more likely to convert and it's much more binary well the promise is interesting because I think people often think that the promise is the deliverables right and Promise vs Guarantee they conflate it with a guarantee which is not the same thing of course so my first coaching offer was 1 hour a week for I don't even think I had a minimum I think it was just 1 hour a week and this is the monthly price and it was if anyone interested it was 600 us a month so it was $150 per hour and that was up from the $13 an hour I was getting paid I was I'm rich right but I had no promise I was just we will meet every week for an hour and I will teach you these things and I didn't even have a lovely system it was more oh you're a real estate agent I'll help you get more listings but again the emphasis was on the deliverables and so the best I would argue you did have a promise and my and my lexicon of promises because you you were promising time and attention in a in a predictable amount you were say I will spend an hour a week with you right right so that's a promise yeah of course it's it's not a promise

these things and I didn't even have a lovely system it was more oh you're a real estate agent I'll help you get more listings but again the emphasis was on the deliverables and so the best I would argue you did have a promise and my and my lexicon of promises because you you were promising time and attention in a in a predictable amount you were say I will spend an hour a week with you right right so that's a promise yeah of course it's it's not a promise to say I'll spend an hour hour a week with you and you're going to be a millionaire by next January but the promise is is largely defined on what they get and that's why one-on-one coaching is easier to sell than group coaching because the promise is more easier to Define I will spend time with you yeah so it's more easier to ATT so so help me understand for a second when Dream Outcome you say promise you talking about dream outcome or you talking about the commitment you're making to someone the commitment you're making to someone okay got you I was more thinking coming up from dream outcome that totally makes sense cuz the best metap for I've heard around that is the you don't sound the play trip you sound the destination and as Elementary as that sounds that help helps you sell $1000 programs and $100,000 Consulting deals right and so when you think about that dream outcome aspect how should people be thinking about it whether it's weight loss whether it's anxiety whether it's money whether it's productivity when people are trying to figure out okay whether it's group or oneto one and we'll get to the details in a second yeah what are some of the key things that you think people should be considering when it comes to a dream outcome let's say they're going to sell a 90day 16 weeks not a yearlong not a multi-year thing not a onh hour Consulting deal but a 3 to four month thing what should they be thinking about when it comes to dream outcomes believability because what an underrated or misunderstood thing in the the high ticket space is a lot of people are trying to convey the authority and the confidence in the person who's delivering it whereas in many cases you need to raise the confidence of the buyer much more than you need to raise the confidence of the seller to deliver the result right so smaller smaller promises are easier to keep and that's theistic I always use with clients of many cases I've seen offers triple in conversion by reducing down the the reduce down the number they go from we'll get you 100 qualified calls a month to we'll get you 10 because that the person on the other side of it the 10 is much more relative to where they are now when they're only getting two right so 100 was the thing that didn't convert because it seems it's in Disneyland where it 10 feel something achievable that's a great example because I get cold DM every day and they're we'll get you20 seems to be the new number do you do the numbers on these if you do sh rate close rate we sell a $5,000 you're helping me get to 500,000 a month for $250 a call or some stupid thing but but this is a great point because the first time I ever realized this I had a client called Brian Mark the fitness guy The Promise amazing human in a SE of helping people get to 10K a month that was the promise of all his contemporaries his promise was you're a personal trainer I will help you make $2 to $5,000 a month as an online fitness coach it worked to the tune of a thousand clients for him paying him I think it was $300 $400 month it was a huge lesson for me because 10K it sounds the more obvious thing whatever the bigger numberers if you can confidently say we're going to get you there then surely the bigger numbers I think it's going to help you make more sales but
