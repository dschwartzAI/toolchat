## Complete Framework

## Q&A: The Importance of Differentiation & Creativity James Kemp: The the creative. We've talked about this a bit. And, office hours and the circle calls this week is the creative requirement. Adam Franklin: And these categories and the businesses that we're in. James Kemp: Isn't just the things people look at and images and those things. It's creative. Requirement is is differentiation. James Kemp: Bye, the barriers to entry in almost every James Kemp: coaching, consulting agency services category have just dropped into the floor. James Kemp: Anyone can do and say whatever they on the Internet. And this means that people have James Kemp: fatigue on a lot of different levels. They have offer fatigue, they have face fatigue, they have idea, fatigue. James Kemp: and the the crazier you are the easier it is now, because you will James Kemp: see and do, and feel and say and present things that other people don't have access to, and James Kemp: the one of the declines in performance of advertising is because the speed to copy everybody else is just ramped up to infinity. Right as soon as you launch something good. If people are watching you, someone else will launch almost the identical thing. James Kemp: and that will James Kemp: it does. It has a dual. It's a duality it educates the market. And so maybe it's good, but it also induces fatigue in the market because they're seeing the same idea. James Kemp: said the same way by different people. And they people just get blindness right? James Kemp: And so the creative requirement James Kemp: that the burden on all of us now is to be different right? And the irony James Kemp: is that the more time you spend in places this, the more time you spend looking at what your friends, colleagues, peers, competitors, and those things are, are doing, the harder it is to be creative. Adam Franklin: And. James Kemp: Over over time for me. James Kemp: My best ideas have come from adjacent markets, or taking b 2 c ideas to b 2 b, or taking concepts, and one plus one equals 9 by taking concepts from different places and introducing them into the marketplaces and the places you operate in.

That's why I always try and present the principles and the thinking behind these things rather than just. This is what to do. James Kemp: Because if you just stick on, the this is what to do, and these are the tactics. And this is what to say, and those things James Kemp: that it won't work by default because James Kemp: everybody else is saying it, and everybody else is doing it, and everybody else is saying it in exactly the same way. James Kemp: and James Kemp: some of the measures that people have to take, especially sensitive people who absorb everything and are looking at what everybody else is doing. James Kemp: Some of the measures that people have to take to deprogram themselves from of doing the same thing in the same way, and saying the same stuff, and then getting annoyed that it doesn't work are extreme. James Kemp: So we do, which is all to say, understand the principles, follow the the pattern, but introduce James Kemp: your own process to it. Your own, essence to it, and and those things, and James Kemp: I'm increasingly reluctant to James Kemp: in many ways give scripts. And what exactly do I say in this? And what exactly do I say in that? James Kemp: Because if I'm giving them to 100 people at once.
