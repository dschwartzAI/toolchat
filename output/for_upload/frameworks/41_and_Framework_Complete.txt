# and Framework

## Overview

** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers.

## Complete Framework

Phase Two we cashflow the offer with your audience and we’ll work to tap in these new clients.
I’ll leave you with an offer and system that you can run every single month.
You understand you are getting direct help in structuring offers and campaigns, retaining customers and clients, campaign triage (when things don’t go as planned) and other aspects of cash-flowing the offer to $10k.
What we do together:
Add at least $10k in cash re-working an existing offer or creating
something new and simple to deliver.
Offer Install Call with Me. We create the offers, campaigns, messages,
copy and strategy.
The Syndicate. A private community channel w/direct access to me via
message and calls.
Access to all my most up to date templates and strategies. 12 years of strategies. I will give you access to new strategies that are working in my businesses if it meets your specific goals.
Investment?
Your investment uses my Pay As You Profit model that means you keep the majority of the profits we create together
$5k now.
Then: $5k when we hit $10k of sales
I’ll even let you finance the initial $5k over 12 weeks @ $500 per week.
What do you need to bring?
You’re already selling a high ticket offer between $2k-$20k, probably via the phone, and you’ve only sold to 1-2% of your total audience.
You have an email list, Facebook group, Linkedin connections or Instagram followers with a couple of thousand people.

Want in?
Message me and I’ll get you setup.

Make it the best it can be and offer it to your leads.
Tomorrow those leads will be buyers and you'll both be further along than you were today.
I walk through exactly how to make offers in The Offer Code.
A couple of folks who bought a couple of days ago have already turned stuff they already had into offers and $$.
There's a live workshop I've included for anyone who picks up the Offer Code before Thursday.
It's $100.

James 'make more offers' Kemp
PS; Workshop is Thursday at 7am Singapore. Scheduled 2 hours but often go longer. Replay will be sent out 24 hours later.
Email 6:
One of my mentorship clients has grown their business revenue 70% in the past 15 weeks.
From £31k to £51k for two consecutive months.
80% of this revenue increase is from recurring revenue.
Their goal is £83k per month average or the 'magic million' per year.
Here's 3 insights I shared with them on Tuesday:
1) Spend more and grow faster:
They are getting front end leads for less than £2 with, chat's with qualified prospects for £14 and calls for £38. There's lots of slack in their KPI's. When something is working you identify the future failure point and then double down on the high leverage activity. The high leverage is cheap leads and the break point is their setting team and process.

. Russell Pearson: Yeah. And it's a so 21 total year. And if you're talking, maybe 100 or a hundred 50 a week. Russell Pearson: That's the community piece. James Kemp: Yeah. James Kemp: lots of people having great results unbundling their main programs that. James Kemp: So they, my recommendation would be offer them a one-on-one call as a bonus to get started, just I do James Kemp: have go. James Kemp: I'm running an experiment for 5 people on a founders offer who want access to all my James Kemp: all my trainings and a little bit of access to me, and one access to the amazing community and the for the first 5 people. It's a hundred bucks a week. James Kemp: because it's about driving velocity James Kemp: and ultimately driving more clients. James Kemp: And then you could raise it up to to be more., closer James Kemp: to 50% of what the current James Kemp: offers. This. Which is a good ratio. So you're at 1750. So that's about 3, 50, James Kemp: 3, 50 a week. James Kemp: So if you raise that up to 100 5,200 for the community only offer. James Kemp: then you get plenty of people upgrading to the to the forge. Russell Pearson: Yeah, cool and the and so is there any nuance or any mistakes that I could make by Russell Pearson:, I'm thinking, from the scaling point of view, by Russell Pearson: offering people at that lower price point where they just get in for lifetime value. Russell Pearson: I guess it's just the boundaries that you're talking about. Just don't go, allowing them into one on one stuff and outside of any specific office. James Kemp: Yeah, no, just don't make exceptions. James Kemp: which is the key piece to to client delivery businesses, which might be exceptions, but might themselves have to scale and stressful. James Kemp: And I, when you when you can approach the the nuance with the messaging would be James Kemp: very clear, it's 1,750 a month to work with me in the forge for that. You get lots of access to me. Lots of people just want access to my James Kemp: training and methodologies and a little bit of access and and and a community of support. If you're self-directed, then this might be for you. James Kemp: and then it's very clear that if I want more of you. I can just Russell Pearson: always 1 one. Yeah. Great fantastic. Appreciate that James Kemp: cool. James Kemp: Yeah, just to still it down., there's a number of programs going out there right now, 2,000, 402,500, James Kemp: and then offering, access to the community element. And and I'm bundling, and James Kemp: they're upgrading a ton of people right? Because that that easy weekly pricing makes it easy to get started to upgrade to the thing. James Kemp: And that's the Bolton. That's the Bolton approach. The community offer can be a lower, a lower level entry level on the 2 main program. James Kemp: Any more questions. Emily Utter: I have a question about what I'm including, cause I think maybe I didn't quite do it right. Not right. But what . James Kemp: Hmm. Emily Utter: but arcs. Hand is up, too. Emily Utter: Should I go ahead or wait? Got it? Emily Utter: Okay? So I wanted to do mine where I wasn't promising every single week, cause

The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."
 This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings. ## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles **Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened? Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them. Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week. Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed. Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days. It's sexy to the right person. Helping people get their first 500 or next 500. Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event. If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter. Small promises are easy to keep. Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this? A community connects them. You're building a network. What's in it for them? The first sale is to yourself. Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes. Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase? If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific. Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution? The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community. Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle. What happens? We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan. You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing. What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance. Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers. Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: 
> "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."
