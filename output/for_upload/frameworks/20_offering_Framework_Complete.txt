., so, there is no upper limit. But the promise is very manageable and very measurable for someone who's got, just some basic things that I can work with. James Kemp: you understand? Over 12 weeks we install in cash flow one client offer generating at least 10 K. In sales. James Kemp: Right? It's binary. James Kemp: If you don't want that James Kemp: right fine, it's you don't need that right now. You don't benefit from it. You don't see the benefit from it, etc. James Kemp: It is easy to say no to not either. That's not my priority right now. I need more leads or no., I'm already at 7 figures, and 10 K, is my coffee bill for next month. Right? So it's it's it's it's right in the pocket of relevance of someone who's a good fit for me and the syndicate, who's probably at between 10 and 30 KA month, who's looking to reorganize things and make them more stable and more efficient. James Kemp: And then I go into a little bit of why offers are important, and then we unpack, and we future pace what happens. James Kemp: So get clear on your ideal market and co-create a client, offer to get some results within the minimum of you. James Kemp: We use a hybrid office, or I insert a mechanism into there and then, in phase 2. I explain what cash flowing is. Right. So we cash flow the offer and work to tap on these new clients. I'll leave you with an offering system that you can run every single month James Kemp: with. I'll talk about ascension and pricing, and how we do it in a moment. If someone buys this and they stay with me for 13 weeks and they go off happy. Then I'm happy if someone buys this, and they stay with me for 13 weeks, and they stay in the syndicate and then stay with me forever. I'm happy. The result delivers. James Kemp: no matter what. There is not holding anything back from the future. The offer is the offer, and it's designed to get the result James Kemp: right, and then again reiterate that. So what we do together, I reiterate what gets done, how it works. So I front load the delivery of these. So we get on a 1 to one call. We do the offer. There's probably a small amount of homework for the people to go for the person to go away with, and then I drop them into the infrastructure I've already got. So that person gets access to the syndicate calls, gets access to the trainings, etc. James Kemp: So again, that's a benefit. James Kemp: That's not the core proposition of the offer. But once they're in, as with, people are coming to the syndicate calls and says, Well, I want to stick around. I this group, etc, etc. Then they go James Kemp: the investment I'll talk about. I use pay as you profit in a few different ways. I'll talk about this in more detail in a moment. But. James Kemp: this James Kemp: template covers. I don't use this pricing right now. But this one is 5 K. Now 5 K. When we hit 10 k. Of sales. James Kemp: and I put the pay plan secondary. So I'll let you finance the initial 5 K. Over 12 weeks at 500 per week. James Kemp: Then I have a qualifier. You're probably doing these things. You're probably dissatisfied with this. You have these things right? James Kemp: And we are more defined. James Kemp: What about who we don't work with and who we do

# delivery Framework

## Overview

If you focus on delivery, then have a system to distribute it, you'll get the best results.

## Complete Framework

. Solve a single problem, deliver a single result. Sell them what they want, give them what they need. I trick my clients into coming by making it sound more fun. I'm a big proponent of selling the next thing, making it sound great, but delivering what they need. Magic pills sell. Frame it magically while staying ethical. If you're experienced, you can take more risks testing new ideas. I believe people's time is precious. Repurposing something you're confident about and giving it a new frame is the best way to deliver. I've delivered workshops about workshops 3 times. I find new things, so I reteach. Remember they're a small sum of the larger part. I can't help you build a sovereign business in this workshop. There's a bigger piece. Three types of workshops: demonstration (show what's working, give them the things that work), model (show the overall model, give them a plan), and mechanism (help them use the mechanism to get a result). Demonstration: show what's working, why it works, give them the things that work, and let them replicate. I want people to copy me. Model: show the overall model, give them a plan, help them envisage theirs. Mechanism: help them use the mechanism to get a result. Traffic to your sales page is warm. You don't need long sales pages. Short, punchy, bullet-pointed pages work best. The more you give to sell, the more objections. Put logistical details on the sales page. Content pre-sells the sales page. 3-7 day promotion periods work well. Most people run out of things to say before 7 days. Content builds context. By the time they get to the sales page, they're sold on the context. Your workshop depends on your delivery method. Some do slides, workbooks, docs, straight to camera. I docs because they help me think. Delivery has two parts: the vehicle (document, slides) and the conversation (Q&A). Insight can happen during or after. The replay goes into the community. If they don't join, they get it on an ungated page. Ungated means it's pirated, but it works in your favor long-term. How do you get clients? The key metric is the number of offers you make. Insert the offer briefly but carefully. Client offers convert better when offered to customers. Workshops convert better than webinars. It's easier to sell to someone who's bought before. Five touch points: 24 hours and 60 minutes before, beginning, end, and replay. If you offer a call, that's a fifth touch point. The more offers you make, the more clients you get. Three common mistakes: building a workshop a webinar, building a workshop to sell (leaving pieces out), and creating workshops when desperate for clients. Even if you don't have clients, run a workshop for an imaginary client. Focus on delivery. Results are created long-term. Good results come from giving good insights, teaching, and experiences. If you focus on delivery, then have a system to distribute it, you'll get the best results. Your marketing becomes demonstration and distribution. Most people spend 80% of their time marketing, 20% delivering. I spend 80% creating for clients, 20% productizing and monetizing. I work backwards from what clients need. There's a paradox with workshops: some of the best for clients are the worst for customers. Think about turning workshops into long-term assets the same way you think about ads. Run 10 workshops to find the one that works long-term. Judge them on three dimensions: product, delivery, and client generation. What are you focusing on? Client acquisition? Run spicy workshops that give immediate results. When upselling, send reminders 24 hours and 60 minutes before
