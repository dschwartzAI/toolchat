The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."
 This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings. ## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles **Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened? Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them. Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week. Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed. Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days. It's sexy to the right person. Helping people get their first 500 or next 500. Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event. If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter. Small promises are easy to keep. Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this? A community connects them. You're building a network. What's in it for them? The first sale is to yourself. Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes. Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase? If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific. Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution? The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community. Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle. What happens? We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan. You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing. What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance. Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers. Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: 
> "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."

## Overview

with a cash flow based funnel with a customer funnel complementing that we can generate cash every day and generate sales every day that feeds the whole system.

## Complete Framework

## Benefits of the Dual-Mode Funnel So the the 2.0 funnel, is a is a dual mode we are generating leads. And we're also generating customers that as we go along, they, we, we need to optimize them based on the market. How many people are coming through as leads? How many conversations are you generating? How many customers are we generating, and at what value, and what are they buying right? So the immediate result is the and the 2.0 funnel is you get leads, customers and clients every day. Right? You're also getting future buyers and new customers and new clients at a high velocity much higher than nurture based funnels. So cash flow grows as the funnel dials in allowing you to scale marketing, spend faster than a traditional funnel in a traditional funnel. You've got to put leads in the top, have conversations. Wait till you get the client out the other side to understand what's the cost per acquisition, etc, etc. with a cash flow based funnel with a customer funnel complementing that we can generate cash every day and generate sales every day that feeds the whole system. So I found with these type of funnels running them in conjunction, you can scale them quicker because you are getting cash on the daily basis rather than having to wait 7 or 14 or 30 days to get a client out the other side and the other major byproduct is my list that the growth of my email list is predominantly made up of buyers these days. Right? So as my email list grows, I have more and more buyers. If I have more and more buyers on my email list, I get a higher response when I make an offer, because I've already got people on the list who are buyers. So the slow, steady, but, appreciable, compounding effect which most good things come from that compounds. Today. When I make an offer, I get a much higher response rate than it was than if it was made up from purely leads. I would much rather have a smaller list made up of buyers and customers than a large list made up of people who have just opted into something, and I've got the permission to communicate with.
