that you've done y but you can follow the sequence there cuz I followed a similar sequence I got 161 :23 to1 clients at 12 bucks a week yeah and I did that for 4 months and that's all I did and I was in safety because I was :31 making enough money and I was fine and I had Consulting revenue from other things on the side and I was :36 offloading some other things that were still making money but I was offloading those to reduce the stress :42 because I knew on the other side of the 16 that then I'd add a community and then I made a slight tweak to the one to :48 one which I went from the the same model that you're running which is this is how many calls you get to to variable :54 calls on Demand right which is and that dropped the call volume by 40% which created more capacity but I still didn't :01 raise the number of one to one clients because I'm cool I can get capacity back time and energy to scale but all :07 along the way the hidden thing for me was I only do calls on Tuesday and Thursday so I don't feel stressed :14 whatsoever but because I put put constraints on what I was prepared to do :20 and unprepared to do in terms of feeding those things in so that also I think that helps in not getting caught up with :26 the the nonsense that people have of this is one to one is it scalable is it could questioning the :32 modality when really if you just do calls on Tuesday and Thursday I had an unusually heavy day yesterday did seven :38 calls right and it was that's okay what have I done today yeah come here :44 and talk to you and I went went to breath work and but it's the the sequence I think the thing that :51 people don't miss is that time Dimension that you can go through that sequence really quickly whereas someone listening :56 to this might need to do do that over 3 to four years Y and last note on this before we talk about funnel is sometimes :03 it's not even about logic it's about emotion in the positive sense right can we both double our business by doing :11 nothing else and just growing the things we have yes yes do we want to do other things because it sounds fun yes and so :18 did I need to add an in-person events for my community sell I don't think I did but it sounds fun I'm :24 in La next month running an event I'm in Japan in March running an event that sounds fun and so this is where it's :30 also not about need oh but do we need it's you can get to a point if you have high recurring Revenue High :36 profit low stress you don't have to be super strategic and everything have to be logical you can simply do stuff just :42 cuz you want to do it yeah I'll share this because it's been amusing for me I :49 I have not taken any PID PID and Fs this year really and I controversial I I I do :57 with partner offers CU 20K up front and it's a it's a chunk of work cuz I'm co-writing co-creating an offer with :03 someone but there is no pay plan because we just get straight into it and that's a particular type of type of partnership :09 but for my scalable coaching Consulting I've not taken a :16 painful every month I've increased Revenue by at least 14 to 20% my :23 recurring Revenue proportion is over 80% of monthly Revenue so I'm by all :28 and I'm and I made six figures profit this month M didn't quite make six figures last month but I will this month :34 and by every conceivable metric is going up but it's boring yeah isn't that isn't :41 that weird to say that I felt a couple of times of that grind up of just watching the everything just go up
