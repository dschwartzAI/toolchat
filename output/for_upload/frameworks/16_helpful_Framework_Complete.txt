internet I want to look a certain way and it's been a sense of :56 I know for me the physical the physical sensation I think of is just :02 just a sense of comfort yeah in my skin what is that Journey been for you over the last couple of years :09 and was that very difficult was there a moment where you're throwing in the towel on the mimicry and you're :14 going I'm not going all in on James what has that been no the only the only lightning strike :20 moment was when I realized I needed to go online when I was standing in the rain waiting for another Fairy that's the only that only was :28 screw it I've got to do something but everything else has been very Progressive I think two major events were moving to Bali because this place :36 what does it do to you I think it it puts you out in an environment that you're not used to and and is very much :44 it's not it's it's not eat what you kill but it's very much you you realize you're outside of an of the :49 normal systems that you normally depend on and then separating from my wife last year which was :55 oh I have to find myself :00 after being with someone for 25 years which is who am I because you think :06 yourself but when you're in an intimate relationship you both have shared beliefs but you also :12 have beliefs that you need to believe for each other you compromise and and then there's trade-offs so that those :18 two things have have been the biggest catalysts along that journey of finding :23 who I really am because again for in the last nine months it's been around doing :29 the things I had to do and and we you talk about authenticity as well it's the last nine months have been the :35 most brutal emotionally but also financially that I've had to endure for :40 almost a decade for obvious reasons :46 but I've never felt more certain :51 of who I am and enabling me to operate in that because :58 I had to I have to people depend on me so I think :05 when you get when the when it gets real you have to be authentic to yourself :13 otherwise you don't this is the choice that you've made right when it gets real you don't have to :19 be authentic to yourself there's so many different parts you could have taken this year so why yeah we've talked this one :25 what was it about this year that you were big so sorry to interrupt no :31 guys so business is moving in a great direction for you now yeah but you could have just as easily gone I'm just :37 gonna focus on being a dad and not that you're not doing that yeah but you're also taking leaps and strides and :42 your health and things that it's definitely something that you using to make yourself better but not everyone :49 makes that choice no and that's a brutally hard choice because it's much easier to :57 what has caused you to approach it the way that you have this year I don't feel I have any choice and :04 that's what keeps me going and even hearing people say what a good job I'm doing and all those things and I get lots of Praise from lots of people makes :09 me uncomfortable so I'm still working on the being being grateful for who I am and :15 what I do and that and that receiving book because I feel uncomfortable now just from you going :20 you could have done this another way and it could be much worse and it could be objectively :26 so your faint praise is is always welcome but discomforting :31 I I reconfirm stuff that I guess I knew I love being a dad :37 but I didn't know that I knew that right because my ex-wife and I had :44 different ideas of children and what what they'd what what impact they'd had on our lives and those things :50
