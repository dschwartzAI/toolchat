# your Framework - Complete Guide

# your Framework

## Overview

If you optimise pricing, you stand to both make multiples of your current revenue and have a higher caliber client and results.

## Complete Framework

Price Engineering
Pricing is an extensive topic that can be boiled down to a simple principle:
The lower the dollar figure we ask for today, the higher the volume achieved.
If you optimise pricing, you stand to both make multiples of your current revenue and have a higher caliber client and results.
There is no one size fits all with pricing.
Use my Office Hours to get specific help from me on your pricing.
In general; for coaching and consulting the smallest unit of time and money is the week.
Weekly pricing allows us to offer the lowest possible Now Number to a prospect.
It's easier to say yes to $300 now than $1200 now.
The Two Now Numbers to optimise for:
1. How much they pay today. 2. How much they save today.
Traditional example:
Coaching program: $1500 per month/$18k per year $17k for the year
Hybrid Program: $400 per week $17k for the year (save $3000)
When I have run these structures side by side with clients and partners, The Hybrid Offer outperforms the traditional structure by 2-3x in both conversions and cash collected.
And...having weekly recurring revenue is cashflow on steroids compared to the relative lumpiness of monthly billing.
Stacking Economics
Stacking a community with coaching, consulting and services on top just makes sense.

I use a combination of ongoing consulting, mentorship, one time consulting hours and in-person events.
1 in 3 community members buy some or all of these on joining or within the first 6

Offer Creation Using The 3 P's
These are 3 principles to get you started:
1/ Promise and Plan
The offer lives and dies on the first page. Actually, the first 3 paragraphs. Get these right and the offer sells itself.
Clearly articulating the Promise of what gets done and the Plan of how it rolls out allows the prospect to 'see' the future if they commit to buying.
This is distinct from the logistics of how and when the offer is delivered.
No one cares how many calls there are or how much coaching they get until they are committed to the result that the Promise and Plan describe.
Match this to the 'right' price and you are 80% there is having a high converting offer.
Promise
What gets done? ● What can you point at? ● Can you describe what they will see show up in their lives if they commit? ● Can you articulate in words their deepest desires better than they can? ● Bonus: What aren't they going to do and what negatives downsides are you helping the avoid?
Plan
What happens first? ● What happens next? ● What happens after that?

Have you painted a clear picture of how the next few days and weeks look like and what
they will see show up? (future pacing)
Clear beat's cute. Name and brand your systems but don't overdo it.
Price
● Have you made it easy to get started? ● Does your price factor in the cost of inaction?
Is there a clear ROI?
No one wants to watch 54 videos and attend 10 hours of calls a week.
Telling people whats IN it is more likely to kill demand than enhance it.
Examples:
The Syndicate Example
Offer conversion rate of 32% ● Average client value 121% above entry price ● Chosen to make no guarantees or promises

Stacking LTV
Offering upgrade options is the way to maximise revenue.
Offering TOO MANY upgrade options when presenting the offer will harm conversions.
To allow us to maximise revenue we must discern when to present them.
The checkout page is the first touch point after the offer doc.
You can add additional options that will get direct purchases, create enquiry and flag to the client that they can add additional services and access to you now or in the future.
PAYMENT
[Payment table showing:
Syndicate - $300 Weekly ($300 per week) - Quantity: 1 - Price: $300.00 ● Syndicate plus Private Slack Coaching $800 Weekly (Save $500) ($800 per week) - Quantity: 1 - Price: $800.00

What can you point at? ● Can you describe what they will see show up in their lives if they commit? ● Can you articulate in words their deepest desires better than they can? ● Bonus: What arent they going to do and what negatives downsides are you helping the avoid?
Plan
What happens first? ● What happens next? ● What happens after that? ● Have you painted a clear picture of how the next few days and weeks look like and what they will see show up? (future pacing)
Clear beat’s cute. Name and brand your systems but don’t overdo it.
Price
● Have you made it easy to get started? ● Does your price factor in the cost of inaction?
Is there a clear ROI?
No one wants to watch 54 videos and attend 10 hours of calls a week.
More offers fail because they are indigestible than lean.
Telling people whats IN it is more likely to kill demand than enhance it.
Examples:
Your next task is to construct an offer using a simple Google Doc.
We use a Google Doc as it is fast to create, share and modify.
It is most useful to demonstrate via examples:

Syndicate Member Example:

The key is to have a product that allows for higher client value over and above the Community level.
Your community offer is 12 months.
We get into the nuance of how to sell this next but laying out a plan allows us to maximise lifetime value on a pathway that makes sense to the prospect.

Price

. so the only key James Kemp: is to have a product that allows for higher client value over and above the community level, because the community level is relatively constrained., we can make 100 to 150 to $200 a week in terms of total client value, and $3,000 a year if we're doing a pay and full option for that. So it's relatively constrained. So we must find those people to expand their economics. James Kemp: and the people who are higher up the power law ladder, who want to go faster. Some people just want one on one help and customization. James Kemp: The second piece with the product is, how long is it? James Kemp: Again, being prescriptive? Your community offer is 12 months. James Kemp: Okay, so we get to the nuance of how to sell this. But the plan allows us to maximize lifetime value on a path pathway that makes sense to the prospect. James Kemp: So that's the product piece. James Kemp: And a lot of people labor this and get caught up. And I need to include a lot of stuff James Kemp: most products James Kemp: die. James Kemp: Add indigestion they're just hard to consume, and there's too much stuff in them. And that's James Kemp: I've kept that simple on purpose, and that's the that's again, the part that people want to add complexity to, because they think they should include a lot of stuff. Or they look at other people, including a lot of stuff James Kemp: when all you need is content, community and customisation. James Kemp: So that's the product. And the offer is the wrapper around it. James Kemp: So the promise and the plan drive the offer. James Kemp: The offer lives and dies on the first page. And when we get to the Google Doc and some examples James Kemp: it desired, it lives and dies in the first 3 paragraphs. James Kemp: So if you get these right, the offer sells itself James Kemp: clearly, articulating the promise of what gets done, and the plan of how it rolls out allows people to see the future before they commit to buying. James Kemp: This is very distinct of the logistics of how and when everything is delivered what's in it. No one really cares how many calls there are, or how much coaching they get until they're committed to the result. James Kemp: Right? That is pure logistics, and many offers and products are just jammed up with all the stuff James Kemp: that's in them. James Kemp: So match this to the right price, and you are 80% there and having a high converting offer. James Kemp: One of the James Kemp: secrets that how I get fast results with people is distilling down into that first page of the offer. James Kemp: You have a great offer. James Kemp: and, up to 10 million dollars. Now the business is the offer. That is, the may drive a performance. So I'm distilling down the primary things that make a high performing profitable business. James Kemp: So James Kemp: what gets done? James Kemp: And again, this is a important exercise. James Kemp: What gets done? What can you point at? Can you describe what they will see? Show up in their lives if they commit to working with you? Can you articulate in words their deepest desires even better than they can? James Kemp: What aren't they going to do, and what negative downsides? Are you helping them avoid? James Kemp: So what's the plan? What happens first? What happens next? What happens after that? James Kemp: Have you painted a clear picture James Kemp: of how the next few days and weeks look, and what they will see show up. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems

. because clear beats, cute James Kemp: name and brand your systems. But don't go over the top. James Kemp: and with pricing is there a clear roi? Have you made it easy to get started? And I've done that by giving you the prescriptions of the pricing? James Kemp: And does your price factor in the cost of inaction? Have you just made it really easy to get started as the primary model? And again. this. I'm laboring this because it's a massive failure point. James Kemp: No one wants to watch 54 videos and intend 10 h of calls a week the better the client, and, the more money they have, the less time they have James Kemp: right, because more offers fail because they are indigestible rather than Lane James Kemp: telling people what's in it., all the things they get is more likely to kill demand than enhance it. Again, it's a common failure point that I see in products and offers that people are talking about all the stuff they get. James Kemp: and in and a desire to overwhelm them with value. James Kemp: And it's lazy, because if you have a clear promise and a plan, people don't need to know all the value you you deliver, they just need to get, be clear about it, so they can say yes and get started. James Kemp: So is to get some examples to bring these things together. Your next task is to construct an offer using a simple Google Doc James Kemp: syndicate folks, 95% of you should have one right now. So the reason we use a Google Doc as far as it's fast to create James Kemp: and to share and to modify. And it's most useful to demonstrate James Kemp: by examples. And I've got a template for you here as well. James Kemp: so this is an example from Jason and Janine. James Kemp: and it talks clearly about the promise James Kemp: and the plan. So the promise is. James Kemp: do you want support for me, and my incredible, incredible community can install a system that can can James Kemp: consistently attracts 5 prospects every month, securing at least one high value client every single month on your terms with the visibility you deserve, and without becoming stuck in the frustration of being the best kept secret. James Kemp: so clearly, clearly, clearly articulates what happens right? It uses numbers. It uses currency to clearly say. James Kemp: this is what's going to happen. This is what you get, and these are things you can point at James Kemp: it clearly, says that it's a 12 month program. but then it comes into over the next 6 weeks. James Kemp: and it talks about the plan will develop your client roadmap so you can. So you are faster. James Kemp: So your laser focused on who you work with. And more importantly, they'll want to work with you right? James Kemp: Then we install your product roadmap James Kemp: very clear. No cuteness. Just the client roadmap, the product roadmap, and then the IP generator system. James Kemp: So it's a great example James Kemp: of being very, very clear about the promise and the plan. and again distilling it down and removing any superfluous bits around the core. Right? Everything else in there is a benefit James Kemp: but the core James Kemp: clearly clearly articulated in the promise as something desirable, and the plan that future paces people to go through. James Kemp: This is what sales offers. James Kemp: If someone is clear that those are the things they want, and they agree with the plan. James Kemp: they are very, very, very likely to want to get started when the price meets the expectation. James Kemp: and again the pricing I've given you, will meet the expectation

. Right? James Kemp: The currency is money. the way I do it is unique to me. James Kemp: Emily's currency is money, the way she does it is unique to her. James Kemp: Your currency is money. the way you do it is unique to you. James Kemp: So you're encapsulating. But the core people. There. James Kemp: you're encapsulating the how. James Kemp: in terms of a differentiation, if you . Gieo: In that. Yeah. Gieo: I see. Okay, to build James Kemp: our goal is a million dollar health consulting practice. James Kemp: or our goal is building a million dollar lifestyle health practitioner with 100 clients or less or 10 HA week on the tools or whatever it is. Right? Gieo: Yeah, yeah. Gieo: it is in less and less time, more money and less time. Gieo: So yeah, that makes a lot of sense what you just pointed out there. Gieo: And he, he II think it's always a nuance to our, to our audience as well, because II certainly use., your framework, which was super helpful. Santa saved a huge amount of time. Gieo: And of course I changed the wording because pumping out cash. I don't. That's not the way that my people say it. I don't think it made me think that. So I change. Gieo: the nuance of what they want in in my, in my community, I said, everybody wants money, but but in my community, I think people want time more than anything, more more time, freedom. James Kemp: Yeah, the the core. James Kemp: People say they want more. People say they want more time, but they want money. James Kemp: So they because they think they can buy it. Gieo: Okay. James Kemp: So if you default to more money Gieo: and the methodology gives them more money in less time. James Kemp: Then it's a it's a safer default. Bet that the market accepts. Gieo: Yeah. Gieo: Oh, good. Well, thank you. Thanks for the feedback. And I said, I have Gieo: obviously been working with you for a bit, and got so much value out of this, and I hear something a little bit different each time. And and of course, as I'm building my own content and everything. So this whole piece about what is the core offer. II think there, I think there's layers of meaning in it. James Kemp: And there's la, there's always laser, meaning everything. And I'm, and I'm being overly simplistic today on purpose. James Kemp: because you can obfuscate all of these things James Kemp: and call it nuance right. But when we get to the core of the reason for the offer existing, and you being oriented towards the market, there's layers and layers of why you won't do that. Well, you can't do that. James Kemp: But the core pieces. What are you in the business of? James Kemp: And then adding your own unique. Spin to it. Gieo: Yeah. Gieo: Well, the the thing that I'll say to you before I jump off here, is that the other piece Gieo: just to affirm and confirm Gieo: is the commitment, so I will do what was prescribed, and I recommend other people do as well. So I will put an offer out to at least 10 people, probably a bunch more. Gieo: And I'll I'll report back. James Kemp: Yeah. Got some sales last week? Right? So you're you've got your James Kemp: thank you, sir

that doesn't exist yet for someone and then allowing them to be Rel make it relevant to themselves so the the the low level the the surface level is is selling money the secondary level is is is selling time to some degree and the infinite game is is is is being in in the market to sell energy and then using the modalities that we have to to do that and in terms of service and delivery there's there's only really four and you just mix those modalities based on your Skool set four modalities to sell energy you mean four modal to serve so we've got coaching Consulting mentorship and Service delivery right and Service delivery is just I'll do this thing for you and it it is nothing else I I'll do this thing for you I will spend $110,000 a month on Facebook ads for you to this funnel and this will happen you will have leads in your calendar and you call them on the telephone right yeah and it and it ends there we wrap a lot of stuff around it but service delivery is just doing something for somebody mentorship mentorship is this is how I would do it so my high level mentorship is people asking me how I think about things and how I've done things in the past that have got success that they want to replicate and I say this is how I do it this is how I think about it Consulting is telling people how to do something and then in the modern pance of consult Consulting is it's doing it with them so your traces of knowledge are left after you stop Consulting your system your ideas your philosophy is left there because you've done it with them and it's been embedded in the in the business got it and coaching has helped someone see that they've already got the things inside them to do the required action help someone see and give them Insight enough to get them to do the thing that they need to do that they're telling you that that we ultimately move them forward and we switch between those modalities naturally a lot of agencies do a ton of Consulting but they don't get paid for it and that's a gigantic opportunity for almost every agency to have a Consulting level in their business that just does Consulting and monetizes it because it's very high margin and high value work and business and so people are unconsciously do change between those modalities when they they're being a coach or even being an agency owner or being a consultant but those modalities when you understand the the what they are and how to deploy them that it opens up a world of opportunity about how you can use them either as individual products sell them as individual products but also serve people better in that time you've been on my on my group calls with folks and I and I ask permission to consult to them if I've got time and space I'll coach someone because that will leave the longest lasting Legacy because they they'll be able to do it themselves if we don't have time and they and they're floundering around as can I just consult you and tell you the answer and you going and do it and 99 times out of 100 they say yes right because they're looking to they're looking for the the life raft out of it but when you use these modalities you can serve people a lot better but in the process of that you serve yourself a lot better you serve yourself a lot better is that what you said yeah because Serving yourself you're because why why are you serving yourself better with those modalities because you're setting the correct expectations and life and a and a and a human world is about expectations and if you don't if you if you coach someone to do something but you're telling them what they want and what to do and you think you're coaching them but you're Consulting to them you're setting an expectation that this thing is going to be right for them rather than allowing to discover it themselves and that will Downstream have an effect on their application of that piece their their their results from it and ultimately their desire to continue it
