. I have 80% conversion rates. And without skipping a beat, hormo goes, oh my gosh, that's horrible. And the guy's really taking aback and he is, oh man, you charge way too little. And it was such a powerful moment seeing the penny drop for my client in such an abrupt way of, oh wow. Yeah. What am I doing? This is crazy. And I think that's a real, pricing. I, I have really strong thoughts on pricing 'cause I don't think you should charge a ton of money and make sales really hard and retention really hard. You're looking for a sweet spot. But on the flip side, it's when I had modern autonomy last year, I was charging, I want everyone to hear this. Listen. 'cause it's very, very powerful. I was charging 297 a month for this is, this is real for six support calls a week and unlimited one-to-one with a coach, 297 a month, cancel any time, right? We, we got people in, but it was a nightmare, not the right people. Then in August we stripped back from six calls a week to one call a week. And I, and we removed all one-to-one and we de we increased the price from 297 a month, cancel anytime to $150 a week with a 16 week commitment. No, it was a six month commitment. We sold more people in and we attracted way higher quality people with 80% less delivery. Then we went to 200 a week and it continued to sell and we got 30 clients at that price point in August. Completely automated. That was a huge, huge lesson for me. Sometimes this problem we have of not working with the, the right clients, clients with really, really high standards, low work ethic, not the great vibe. It's a reflection of price because you get what you settle for. Yeah. And at different price points and different goals, the friction levels will be opposite. Right? My $9 trial has a very different goal in terms of friction and filtering than working one with me one-to-one, right? Yep. And so the friction management at, if you've got multiple price points and multiple products or multiple at, at, at, it's related to how much proximity the person has, how much access, what commitments you're making. Yeah. So the, the, pricing is a filter. Yeah. Well, do this guy, this guy Dan Gogh on X? Yeah. So I think Vince is still on the call., he was telling me that he met Dan Gogh. Dan Gogh's a fitness coach, a health and fitness coach. And so he, he probably has an offer, I could probably guess the price point somewhere in the three to $6,000 range. And, but Vince was telling me he has a hundred thousand dollars offer And then he sold it. He sold a few of them. And there's, there's a really interesting framework pricing that I think sometimes it's really, really helpful to have a super expensive thing that number one might take more of the level of support than you, than you want to scale at capacity. And number two, value anchors everything else. someone reached out the other day, who's one of the top network marketers in the world who's become a really good friend of mine. And she was, can you help me build the IG funnel?, help me build it out, do some of it for me. And normally I would just be, this is, I would never do that, but she's really cool. And I was, maybe this would be interesting. So I was, okay, it's 36 K, right? Because I had to find a price that I was, I'd be willing to do it for this amount

# one Framework

## Overview

** This segment focuses on using workshops as a powerful tool for acquiring clients.

Guy: My offer is for project managers: 6-figure role, reduced stress. Is that enough to differentiate? Most people would take a little bit more stress for more money. Focus on the 6-figure PM job. Reduced stress is the next problem to solve. Every solution creates another problem. Ahmed: My community offer value drops after 4-5 months. Should I switch to a one-time payment and smaller weekly fee? Pricing is a proxy for value. Why don't you deliver more value? We have weekly trainings. I could teach more, but I'm running out of things to teach. Most businesses have the fundamentals. Bad businesses look for the new piece. Repackage the fundamentals. Give them old value in new ways. Maximize value, maintain/increase price. Khan: I'm launching a community offer in English: $50/week for calls and community, $150/week for implementation, $250/week for WhatsApp, $750/week for one-on-one. Too complicated? Launch the middle two tiers in a hybrid: $100 and $250. The $100 is an easy start point, the $250 allows for higher-level access. More creates confusion. Treat free members as leads. This is the founding offer. Stefan: I'm working on an offer for customer experience optimization. How do I get specific on the goal when outcomes are different? You choose the playground. The sovereign community offer ($3k to $3k/week) isn't relevant for a $13M/year client. Who's your first customer? A medical supplies business with high turnover, low staff, no digital expert. Currency can be time and energy. Installing one system saves 10 hours/week. What do they want? Demand and money are unlimited. What's the intersection? Sell to the demand that's already there. Adam: How many benefits can be added? All of them, but lead with the core. What if tier one is live a better life, tier two is making money? Too confusing. Tier two is faster, more access. How to get paid in full? Both ways work. For large discounts, don't mention it in the doc. For bonuses, pre-sell it. The $100/week is a strong enough lead. Put offer hypotheses in the community for feedback. Specificity is key. Train yourself to be specific, and it carries over to all communication. Things people can point at are footholds on your content. ## Workshops as a Client Acquisition Strategy **Summary:** This segment focuses on using workshops as a powerful tool for acquiring clients. James emphasizes creating workshops that deliver real value, focusing on client needs, and strategically making offers within the workshop context. Video Source:* 100Dollar Offers.txt **Content:** So when I am starting to think about a workshop, I'm always looking at what clients want. The reason I'm holding a workshop about workshops is that the market is in a low-trust place, and workshops are effective for building trust. The market has become cynical, and workshops are an antidote because they allow you to demonstrate value. Once we've got a concept of what clients need, we turn it into an offer. I make the distinction between products and offers. Products are something we do, an offer is something people engage with. So I package it up in a way that is attractive. $100 is a nice price point. Workshops are challenging if you're doing something brand new. They're not necessarily a place to test concepts, but they are a place to reframe, reiterate, reteach, and remind clients. We have fatigue, life gets in the way, people get off track. The best workshops reiterate, reteach, and remind, giving them a new frame. You need people to do shit. The people who do stuff for you are sick to death of being fat
