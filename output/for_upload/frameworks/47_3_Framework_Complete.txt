Constructing Your Daily Client Machine
How To Generate Leads Hourly, Customers Daily and Clients Weekly
The Sequence - The Order of Events Matters
To hit $1m, it is critical we attack it in the right order.
The common approach is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it's to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it's skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.

4. Automate lead flow and Customer sales and stack recurring revenue that compounds
into $3k per day
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ to generate $3k 2. Customers to Clients™ to generate $3k a week and per day 3. The Daily Client Machine™to generate $3k per day recurring
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
The Sovereign Brand
Size does not matter.
There is no audience too small to get traction quickly.
Actually, the smaller the better in the beginning.
The myth of needing big followings and a huge track record are just that. Myths. Sold by people
who have big followings and gate keep via experience.
You need to have solved one problem once for yourself or someone else and know how to solve
it again.
Nothing more.
A brand is the thing people say about you when you're not there.
You live rent free in someone's head and they associate you with ideas and imagery.
The end point of a brand is to promote action.
When your brand consistently sells someone on ideas and imagery it is very easy to get them to
take action.
It's the natural next step.
The ideal brand does all the selling needed.
Then when an offer is made it's the natural next step.
Creating a brand like this is not easy but it is simple.
There's 3 components:

Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it’s skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.
The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The Hybrid Offer™
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is ‘simple’, it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it’s easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.

. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it. Then you need to decipher all those variables, and most people fail James Kemp: because they're being sold to by marketers whose default choice is marketing. James Kemp: and the best way to head a goal is not to work towards it is to work backwards from it James Kemp: because working fords is chaotic because there's so many potential variables, there's hundreds of ways to market and lot of them work. There's hundreds of ways to sell and a lot of them work. James Kemp: But working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage. James Kemp: because over a long enough time period and everybody's tried that we all have both approaches, get you to the goal, but working backwards, gets you there faster and with more certainty. James Kemp: So we're going to do 3 things James Kemp: we're going to create and validate a threek offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc. And that's what we're going to focus on today. James Kemp: We're going to create and sell a customer offer that converts 5% of its buyers into clients for you James Kemp: in that offer that we've just defined. James Kemp: Then we're going to automate the lead flow and the customer offer and Nsn. Customers into clients every week. James Kemp: So we go from making 3 K. And validating that to 3 KA week to 3 KA day. James Kemp: So we use 3 systems to do this. The hybrid offer James Kemp: which I'll talk about today, customers to clients and the daily client machine. James Kemp: The sequence is very, very, very, very important. because each of these systems solve for a specific stage. and we've got a master one before moving to the next one. James Kemp: and that's the right pace. James Kemp: Right? You may be at different stages, and everybody here is at different stages of the current offer of the marketing of the flow. James Kemp: But skipping steps is not speed. I constantly go back and reevaluate my offer based on feedback. James Kemp: One of the reasons that we use Google Docs is because it's dynamic, right? You can put it on the sales page. And those things later. Once you have something that converts at 30 to 40, James Kemp: but it's dynamic. I'm tweaking words. I'm tweaking, positioning all the time. James Kemp: so skipping steps is not speed. It sometimes feels it. I can just jump straight to marketing. I need more leads, so I can just jump jump to that. But it's just skipping steps. James Kemp: So mastery and the sequence compounds. The better your hybrid offer. The more clients you convert. the better your customers to client system, the more customers and clients you generate. and the better your daily client machine, the more leads turn into customers who turn into clients and and it compounds in action. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate

The language is unforceful. 
> "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."
 Community benefits: 
> "As a member, you get access to every recording and training."
 This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings. ## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles **Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened? Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough? It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them. Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week. Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed. Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days. It's sexy to the right person. Helping people get their first 500 or next 500. Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event. If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter. Small promises are easy to keep. Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this? A community connects them. You're building a network. What's in it for them? The first sale is to yourself. Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes. Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase? If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific. Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution? The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community. Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle. What happens? We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan. You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing. What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance. Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers. Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: 
> "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."

> "Support to install a system attracting 5 prospects monthly, securing 1 high-value client monthly, on your terms, without being the best-kept secret."
 Example plan: 
> "In the first 6 weeks, we'll install the client roadmap, product roadmap, and IP generator system."
 Modalities: Coaching (discovering answers), consulting (giving answers), mentorship (showing how). I create for my community, coach on weekly calls, consult on WhatsApp, mentor on Zoom. You can sell modalities individually or bundled into products. ## Access to Training and Classroom Content **Summary:** This chunk addresses the value of accessing all trainings and recordings within a community membership. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** We've added a valuable benefit: access to all my trainings and templates. Many people want a back catalog of resources. As a community member, you get access to every recording and training. This is a key benefit of joining. ## Offer Specificity and Niche Targeting **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer specificity, avoiding trying to be everything to everyone, and targeting a specific niche. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** Are you clear about your core offer? Have you defined your content, community, and customization? Have you scoped out your promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI? The weakest offers try to be everything to everyone. A clear promise is essential. Have you laid out a plan with unique mechanisms? People buy new things that solve old problems. ## Outreach Templates and Offer Sharpening **Summary:** This chunk discusses providing outreach templates and the importance of sharpening existing offers for better conversion. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** I'll be providing templates for outreach, including social posts and emails. We'll cover these in detail next week. For now, focus on your offer. Are you working on a new offer or modifying an existing one? Let's sharpen your offer for better results. ## Niche Selection and Offer Clarity **Summary:** This chunk uses a real-world example to illustrate how to refine a niche and create a compelling offer promise. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Ramzi's example of e-commerce sellers wanting to step out of their business) A niche defines the desire in the marketplace. It's a good hypothesis, but not specific enough. What will the outcome look for them? Time freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things because they're terrifying. Pre-package a vision for them. 
> "Helping e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week"
 is more specific. 
> "I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week"

> "Helping e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week"
 is more specific. 
> "I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week"
 is even better. ## Binary Offers and Commitment **Summary:** This chunk explains the power of binary offers (yes/no) and how they attract the most committed clients. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** The best offers are binary (yes/no). Maybes make people broke and frustrated. The best offers get people to say yes or no, with a subset of "no" being "not now." Most people will say no to the best offers, but those who say yes are the most committed. Manufacture a binary that allows the right people to say yes. ## Structuring Offers for Choice and Specificity **Summary:** This chunk discusses offering structure, the importance of providing a sense of choice while maintaining specificity, and addressing perceived barriers to entry. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** People want structure and choice. "One day a week" implies they can work two days if they want. Don't be afraid of specificity. The best offers come down to a binary. When creating an offer, you're making an offer most people will say no to. The best offers are specific and polarizing, excluding the majority of the audience. ## Quantifying Offer Promises **Summary:** This chunk uses another real-world example to demonstrate how to quantify offer promises for greater clarity and impact. Video Source:* 100k community.txt **Content:** (Richelle's example of helping business owners with asset-driven businesses) Quantify your promises. "440 subscribers in 30 days" is sexy to the right person. Focus on helping people get their first 500 or next 500 email subscribers. Are they sold on email as the mechanism? Quantify the results of their conversion event (workshop, etc.). 
> "If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one client every time they run it"

## How to Apply

is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
