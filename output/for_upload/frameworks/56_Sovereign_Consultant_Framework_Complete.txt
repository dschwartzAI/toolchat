$100 Workshops
How To Generate Customers, Cashflow and Clients With $100 Workshops
Workshops Work:
The simple definition of a workshop is a live call where something gets done.
Workshops combine information and insight.
How something is done - information How it can work for an individual attendee - insight
Where to create from:
Solve a single problem, deliver a single result ● Clients first, customers second
[Workshop Calendar - October 2024 Schedule Placeholder]
The workshops you create are useful for clients. I will reiterate this regularly...
How to create it:

Magic pills sell in large numbers ● Reminding is more useful than teaching
The best workshops are self-contained. They give everyone a result no matter if they decide to become clients or not. While tempting to leave something out this manipulation comes back in the future.
The best clients understand the value of proximity and insight. They get the information in the workshop and
Most people feel they will be fine with information. The majority will leave and do nothing with it. Some will leave, try to execute it, see it work for them and want more or will see it's harder than it looks and will come back.
The duality of good workshops is that the more you create for clients the more sales you make to customers who are best fit clients.
Said another way, the less sales you try and make the more sales you will make.
The Two Frames
This Is Part Of Client Delivery:
"Welcome to our guests, this workshop is for my clients" Allowing people to understand that this workshop is being held as part of your normal delivery allows them to see and imagine a world they might like to be part of.
Small Part Of Something Larger:

Whether your workshop is demonstration, model or mechanism based it will only cover a small part of your world. Show how it fits into the big picture.
Eg workshops are one component of the Sovereign Blueprint they work alone but work better when you have a great Client offer.
The Power Ladder
The realities of market dynamics can frustrate or be embraced.
Not everybody is going to buy your stuff. In fact, very few will.
The key to leverage is identifying who is likely to firstly, buy, then who will make a custom of buying (customer) and who would find further access to you useful (client)
The Power Ladder™
Understanding market dynamics and sophistication allows you to meet the right person with the right offer to generate insight for their specific stage of growth
What people say and what people do are very different things.
Many people in your addressable market can intend to work with you in the future. Hanging on this hope will sustain you for a little then depress you when it's not fulfilled.

Many businesses go crazy and broke trying to 'educate' and 'nurture' their market when making an offer presents the simplest shortcut.
The strongest intent demonstration is the act of purchasing. This gives you a signal to tune into and explore the intent behind that commitment.
The Sovereign Blueprint
Built on The Sovereign Principles and deploying the correct modality via the correct channel:
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them. ● Consulting - Giving someone the answer. ● Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it ● Creator - Conjuring of original ideas ● Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
If, then:




If I share good content on social and make it easy and natural to join my email list I will grow my leads daily. If I create great workshops for clients then customers will purchase them and a few will naturally see that it's worth joining The Syndicate. If I make it easy to get started in The Syndicate with pricing economics I will maximize client experience and LTV naturally by unbundling and having dynamic offers. If I build a great client base and establish great relationships, I will naturally find those who value being coached in The Circle.

# HighLevel Funnel Reproduction SOP: DCM 2.0 Templates
## Overview This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the step-by-step process for reproducing the "DCM 2.0 Templates" funnel from James Kemp's HighLevel account with customized service and sales copy for clients.
## Funnel Structure Analysis
Based on the API analysis of the DCM 2.0 Templates funnel (ID: ATb1XCi2a8fAMP9ME7cY), the funnel contains the following 8 steps:
### Core Funnel Flow: 1. **Social Code $9 (TEMPLATE)** - Big idea video page 2. **Upsell 1: The 3k Code + Social Code (TEMPLATE)** - First upsell bundle 3. **Upsell 2: Sovereign Membership - 9 Day Trial (TEMPLATE)** - Membership upsell 4. **Delivery - The Social Code (TEMPLATE)** - Product delivery page 5. **The Sovereign Community Membership - Thank You (TEMPLATE)** - Membership thank you 6. **Delivery - The 3k Code and Social Code (TEMPLATE)** - Bundle delivery page 7. **BUMP: The Cash Campaign Templates (Template)** - Order bump/ downsell 8. **The Client Funnel** - Final installation/setup page
## Prerequisites
### Required Access: - HighLevel Agency/Location account with funnel creation permissions - API access (if automating the process) - Copywriting tool access for content customization - Client's business information and unique value proposition
### Required Information from Client: - Business name and branding - Target audience description - Unique service/product offering - Pricing structure - Value propositions - Contact information - Payment processing setup
## Step-by-Step Reproduction Process
### Phase 1: Funnel Setup and Structure
#### Step 1: Create New Funnel

1. Log into HighLevel account 2. Navigate to Sites > Funnels 3. Click "Create New Funnel" 4. Name the funnel: "[Client Name] - [Service Name] Funnel" 5. Set the funnel URL slug: `/[client-service-name]` ##

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

These are sample emails promoting a black Friday sale. The tone, structure, and value provided in each of these emails are what I want to model in the Fire Yourself Series black friday/cyber monday deal.
Email 1
Subject: This Is Very Simple Body:
5 weeks ago I told you exactly what my plan was:
My 5 Step Devious Plan to $10k a day:
1) Start community where I can full send everything I know about building a silly profitable consulting business on your lonesome. Cap at 100.
2) Run workshops every second week for community with said strategies, sell tickets to workshops I'm doing anyway for $100-$300
3) 3 outcomes: People like workshop and want to work with me, join community/people get value, execute themselves/people don't like get refund (hasn't happened yet)
4) Invite true savages to inner circle and help them build to $100k profit per month. Document journey for proof. Cap at 12.
5) Repeat.
And I'm very close to getting there.
(upon which point I have a new plan:) )
We've got 76 out of 100 spots filled in The Syndicate and I closed another intake today.
My Sovereign Circle has 8 great peeps in it.
And over 560 have attended or had access replays and resources of my workshops.
Along the way I've shown you exactly how I'm doing this.
Literally let you look over my shoulder.
And the funny thing is a One Man Band business that does $3m a year in profit is available to you and you only need one key skill.

The 3k Code™ - Why People Buy
Assembling, Crafting and Delivering A High Converting Hybrid Offer inside The Sovereign System
The 3k Code is a prescription.
Assembled, it’s a formula.
While I give some variables and teach you how to think along the journey, results will flow from following the prescription.
My job is to give you the prescription.
This formula is designed to be tight and minimal.
It fails if you try and look for complexity or ‘more’.
Your job is to assemble, test, learn and iterate.
All results happen in the marketplace, not in the consumption of ideas.
Most people get in their own way to prevent getting in the game.
I can give you the formula but you must mix the potion and apply it.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System™
The Phases - Essential Stages of Evolution
To generate a client we can break it into phases:
Lead = Someone we’ve earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to

To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Model - Simplicity Scales
For Clients - We have one community offer and one upgrade option.
For Customers - We have one time products to generate customers and cashflow
It is offer driven.
We get Leads and turn them into Customers. We turn those Customers into Clients

The Sovereign Consultant - The Simplest Path to $1m
The Sovereign Path
The model you choose dictates how you spend your time, energy and the results you ultimately generate for yourself and others.
If it’s not the biggest decision you make, it’s close.
The Sovereign is a model for now.
Intentional, lean and flexible.
It’s less about building a business and more about building a life that a business feeds.
The Space Strategy is attractive because it’s tangible and can offer the lowest cognitive load. It’s simply a series of tasks. Purely operating at a strategic level will be highly volatile and exhausting as the rate of change is high. High rates of change induce high rates of anxiety.
Anxiety is destructive for life and business.
Principles require thought and consistency. They can guide strategy and lower the volatility as they evolve more than change.
Philosophy has the lowest rate of change. It morphs and evolves but the fundamental beliefs change very, very slowly.
Your personal philosophy is the strongest platform to build on.

Show me your calendar and it will tell me what is important to you.
Without a personal philosophy, an approach to life, you will be blown about by the whims of change.
It’s easy to say a certain thing is important to you but how you spend your time actually demonstrates what is important to you.

To live intentionally and live what’s truly important to me I must create time to feel, think and create.
Time and Values Constraints:
Have dinner with my children everyday ● See my kids before they leave the house everyday ● Move everyday
Translates to:
Non-negotiables - daily exercise, date night, family dinner together ● Essentials - client group call weekly ● Flow - Calls only on Tues and Thu Mornings
The Sovereign World has very, very high rates of leverage.
All inputs are intentional and it does not require much time to ‘run’.
But the space is where you and

Create an offer and sell it to your audience 2. Deliver the offer and invite those who purchased it to become clients 3.

Knowing this indicates a moderate to high sophistication level. I felt an offer training and templates would be a good lead offer as I opened up The Syndicate as it appeals to people who largely already have offers and would to optimise them. It is also one of the key things we do inside The Syndicate as great offers are the driver of great businesses. It plays to my strengths, has a high ROI potential and I had massive amounts of proof that the contents of the training was proven and effective. Selling It: 40/40/20: 40% - How desirable the offer is to your audience 40% - The scarcity and deadline you place on it 20% - Your messaging and marketing After the offer selection, the primary driver is scarcity and urgency. If you have these present, it will do most of the heavy lifting

The Blueprint

Template Download Link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/knh22051st9d9ots3dpll/The-Sovereign-Blueprint-Templates.key? rlkey=dkv284vwt2p8zis9qapyy95to&dl=0

The Sequence
The common approach is to work ‘forwards’ from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it’s to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
At a strategic level, we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Promote Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly

The Sovereign Brand
Size does not matter.
There is no audience too small to get traction quickly.
Actually, the smaller the better in the beginning.
The myth of needing big followings and a huge track record are just that. Myths. Sold by people
who have big followings and gate keep via experience.
You need to have solved one problem once for yourself or someone else and know how to solve
it again.
Nothing more.
A brand is the thing people say about you when you're not there.
You live rent free in someone's head and they associate you with ideas and imagery.
The end point of a brand is to promote action.
When your brand consistently sells someone on ideas and imagery it is very easy to get them to
take action.
It's the natural next step.
The ideal brand does all the selling needed.
Then when an offer is made it's the natural next step.
Creating a brand like this is not easy but it is simple.
There's 3 components:

speed creation and selling ✓ A peek behind the scenes into my first offer that generated $1.3m in sales in 13 months ✓ The 'laws of pricing' and why breaking them will kill your offer dead ✓ How to generate millions from a simple Google doc ✓ The word for word template that generated $605,000 in sales without a single call ✓ The exact copy paste template that sold a $15,000 year long mastermind ✓ Step by step walkthroughs of proven offers you can swipe today
Exactly what you get:
✓ The Offer Code training video (39 minutes) ✓ Two offer creation cheatsheets ✓ Copy Paste Template #1: The Highest Convert Offer Ever ✓ Copy Paste Template #2: The High Ticket Mastermind Template
100% Lifetime Guarantee If you do not get value from this training and templates you can claim a full refund at any time for any reason. Simply email your receipt and you will be refunded inside 3 working days.

Creating A Customer Offer
A customer offer simply creates a customer via a purchase.
The price is not irrelevant but it's relatively unimportant. The act of purchasing at any dollar value is a trust signal.

Money. Time. Energy.
Universally valuable currencies.
Crafting an Identity steers people through ideas towards offers.
Selling them on who they can become if they come inside.
There are layers of specificity here.
If you use concepts that you can point at then the ideas are stickier.

3) Build A World
World building is the demonstration and dramatization of the world you live in.
It’s an abstraction to varying degrees of your reality.
How much of an abstraction is personal preference.
If you get too far away from reality then you are playing a character which can be exhausting for many.
There must be some substance behind the world otherwise it is a fairy tale and fairy tales always end.
The core components of World building are:

Characters - Who inhabits your world ● Language - What unique or distinguishing language is used (ideally crosses over with mechanisms)
Places - The locations and environments that it takes place in
The world is communicated through:
Story Lines - consistently communicated open loops ● Memes - consistently communicated ideas
My Characters: The Brazilian, Mr 13, Miss 7, The Cat, The Dog.
My Language: Customers, Clients
My Places: Bali, Planes, The Villa
My Story Lines: Simplifying after separation, solo Dad, road to $3m
My Memes: Oat milk, Atomic Habits

We’ve setup the platform.
Now we need offers to monetise and deliver.

This is an offer driven model.
To generate a client we can break it into phases:
Lead = Someone we’ve earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
Zooming in to The Blueprint:

My example for reference:
The Core
There are Four Core Reasons people buy help:

The Menu
Growing your Community and Consulting via the Hybrid Offer is your focus for building long term value.
But having a Menu of one off or short term offers helps smooth cashflow and provide access to you during the growth phase.
For me, selling time and events are the simplest, highest value offers I can make.
Many who invest in these end up as long term clients as well.
I also have Off Menu one-to-one, partnerships and licensing that I will invite people into after they have become Clients or bought Menu items.
The Sovereign Sales (Secret)
An offer driven model is driven by….offers.
In the delivery to your Clients you are creating assets that can be used in offers.

This is an exercise in simplicity.
I hold two workshops a month for Clients.
I sell tickets to those workshops and create Customers.
I invite those Customers to become Clients. Offer driven.
I tell people I’m hosting a workshop on a valuable topic and they buy tickets:

Clients are consistently being delivered new and refined content, you build a growing library of training and templates for clients and new joiners to the community have plenty of content to solve for.

It’s the most efficient delivery
The Rhythm
Alternating between opening the community one week and selling tickets to a workshop the next can give you a very long runway before requiring structured lead generation.
If you setup a solid Sovereign Brand from the beginning, your audience will grow consistently in the course of this promotional rhythm.
The Steps

- ```txt ## Defining the Sovereign Consultant **Summary:** This chunk defines the concept of a sovereign consultant, emphasizing intentionality in building a mechanism, identity, and operating world to achieve high leverage returns from a small, engaged audience. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The goal is building a million-dollar-per-year solo consultancy with 65 clients or less, working less than two days per week. This is achieved by intentionally building your mechanism, the identity people inhabit when they work with you, and the world you operate in. It's not about massive email lists or social media followers; it's about telling a compelling story to a small group. Intentionality is key to achieving high leverage returns from small audiences. You don't need huge lists, attention, or experience if you're intentional about these three categories. ## Client Acquisition Phases and Demonstrating Competence **Summary:** This chunk outlines the phases of client acquisition (lead, customer, client) and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating competence at each stage to efficiently gain clients and minimize sales pressure. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** This model is alpha-driven. A lead is someone you have the right to communicate with, a customer has transacted with you, and a client receives your dedicated time and resources. To obtain a client efficiently, demonstrate competence at each stage. While people can skip steps, a methodical sequence produces the best clients with the least sales pressure. Understanding intent and desire is crucial, and initiating a transaction is the fastest way to gauge intention. An offer-driven model provides a clear next step for prospects. ## The Client World Structure: Community and Consulting Levels **Summary:** This chunk details the tiered structure of the client world, including community and consulting levels, and explains how a seven-figure run rate can be achieved with just these two tiers. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The client world consists of a community level, a consulting level, and optionally, a mentorship level. The mentorship level isn't necessary for a seven-figure run rate. The community level provides a broad base, while the consulting level offers more intimate, high-access service. A menu of offerings allows for varied sales and delivery. For example, a sovereign community might cost $100 monthly with a $3,000 annual option, alongside other higher-priced group programs and consulting hours at a premium rate. ## Core Reasons People Buy Help and Focusing on One **Summary:** This chunk identifies the four core reasons people buy help (make more money, save money, stay legal, live a better life) and stresses the importance of focusing on just one core reason for business clarity and effective messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** There are four core reasons people buy help: make more money, save money, stay legal, and live a better life. Focus on solving for only one core reason; all other benefits are secondary. Focusing on a single core helps refine messaging, offers, and target audience, leading to greater clarity and effectiveness. While secondary benefits can attract and retain clients, a clear core problem is essential. Losing sight of this core can lead to confused messaging and a diluted brand identity. ## Understanding the Client's Problem and Solution **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of understanding how the core problem manifests in clients' lives, their awareness of it, and their current solutions to effectively tailor your unique solution and messaging. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Understanding your core offering is crucial. Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing

Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it? Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job. Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing. ## Staying True to Your Core Message While Being Multidimensional **Summary:** This chunk acknowledges the multidimensional nature of individuals but emphasizes the importance of sticking to the core message when communicating with clients to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** You are multidimensional, but your business messaging should remain focused on your core offering. While clients can see your other facets, sticking to the core makes your message cut through the noise. Secondary benefits can enhance your offering, but the core problem you solve should be the central focus of your communication. ## The Two-Tier Client Offer Structure and Pricing **Summary:** This chunk prescribes a two-tier client offer structure (community and consulting/coaching) with specific pricing and client numbers to achieve an $83,000 monthly run rate. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A two-tier client offer structure can generate a million-dollar run rate. Tier two consists of 15 clients paying $600 per week, while tier one includes 50 clients paying $150 per week. This structure, combined with a $100-$150 entry-level customer offer, can generate over $83,000 in monthly recurring revenue, requiring only 1.25 new client sign-ups per week. Only 4% of customer offer buyers need to convert to clients to hit these numbers. ## Pricing Strategy: Maximizing Conversions and Economics **Summary:** This chunk discusses the tension between maximizing conversions and economics in pricing, recommending specific price points for community and consulting offers to optimize both. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Pricing should maximize both conversions and economics, which are often at odds. A recommended strategy is a $100-$200 weekly community offer with a $3,000 annual option, and consulting offers between $300 and $600. This pricing structure works across various markets. The $3,000 annual option provides higher upfront value and commitment, capturing more value than shorter-term, lower-priced options. ## The Hybrid Offer: Combining Community and Consulting **Summary:** This chunk introduces the concept of a hybrid offer, combining multiple products (community and consulting) into a single offer with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A hybrid offer combines multiple products within a single offer. For example, a $100 weekly community and a $450 weekly consulting product can be combined into one hybrid offer. This offer includes clear promises, outcomes, and timelines, unlike individual products, which primarily serve as containers for your services. This model allows clients to choose their level of access and speed of results. ## Selling the Hybrid Offer and Ongoing Commitment **Summary:** This chunk explains how the hybrid offer facilitates client acquisition by offering an ongoing commitment and allowing clients to choose their desired level of access and speed of results. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The hybrid offer sells an ongoing commitment, not fixed durations. Clients can choose higher levels of access (consulting or mentorship) while receiving everything in the base community tier. The key is a product that offers higher client value beyond the community level. This allows clients to control their access and the speed of their results, with greater access generally leading to faster results. ## The Nuance of Selling the Hybrid Offer and Maximizing Value **Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of a clear plan within the offer, outlining the promise, plan, pricing, and ROI to maximize value and resonate with prospects.

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Effective offers have a clear promise, plan, and price. A strong promise outlines the specific outcome, installing a lead generation system that attracts five prospects and secures one high-value client monthly. The plan details the steps involved, developing a client roadmap and setting up a content system. This clarity allows for selling longer-term commitments (12 months) by focusing on initial, shorter-term commitments (6 weeks). ## Using Google Docs for Offer Creation and Iteration **Summary:** This chunk advocates for using Google Docs for offer creation due to its speed, ease of sharing, and modification, allowing for dynamic iteration based on market feedback. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Use Google Docs for offer creation. They're fast to create, share, and modify, allowing for dynamic iteration based on market feedback. The market writes the offer; iterate based on their feedback. This dynamic approach allows you to refine your offer until it resonates with your target audience and achieves the desired results. ## Clarity on Your Core Offering and Avoiding Messaging Confusion **Summary:** This chunk reiterates the importance of clarity on your core offering and avoiding muddled messaging, especially as your business grows and evolves. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Clarity about your core offering is paramount. It's easy to get sidetracked, but staying true to your core offering is essential for effective messaging and offer creation. Avoid muddying your message by trying to be everything to everyone. Focus on what you do best and let that clarity guide your decisions. ## Product Structure: Content, Community, and Customization **Summary:** This chunk outlines the three key components of product structure: content, community, and customization, and emphasizes the importance of a clear promise, plan, and price with a demonstrable ROI. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Products should include content (training videos), community (interaction platform), and customization (tailored access). Ensure your offer includes a promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI. If you can deliver on these elements, your offer is market-ready. Different levels of access within the product cater to varying client needs and budgets. ## Validating Your Offer and the Importance of Three Sales **Summary:** This chunk sets a validation milestone of three sales for new offers and explains how even a small network can provide valuable feedback for rapid iteration and improvement. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Aim for three sales to validate your offer. This milestone allows you to test your offer's viability and gather initial feedback. A smaller network allows for faster feedback and iteration, improving your offer more quickly through direct, real-world interaction. If 30% of people who see your offer buy it, you have something scalable

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The sovereign sales secret is monetizing delivery. Create assets during client delivery and use them in offers.

This creates a self-sustaining loop where product delivery fuels marketing and client acquisition, requiring minimal external marketing efforts. ## The Promotional Rhythm: Alternating Community Access and Workshop Tickets **Summary:** This chunk suggests a promotional rhythm of alternating between opening community access and selling tickets to workshops to maintain a consistent flow of leads and customers. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Alternate between opening community access one week and selling workshop tickets the next.

and understanding that if you're an orthodontist who you know in this initial period if you're work an extra 10 hours a week in the future you'll get 20 hours a week back :04 to play golf that's a different conversation right it's putting the truth on the table and saying as you'll :10 agree Mr business owner this requires investment we we require investment of time we require investment of money but :17 you'll get this back in multiples down the track because we Elevate you from operator to chairman in the business and :24 he's going ah I'm an operator right now I'd love to be a chairman but I need to invest something in the way so it is :31 getting the truth on the table and saying these are the things that you want these are the this is the price we :37 have to pay to some degree in the short term but this is the payoff because when you become the the the the orthodontist :45 chairman then then they start to go yeah I'm just chairman of the board and I'm playing golf and you :52 know I'm not I'm not there in there day today pushing the buttons and chasing the payments and and those pieces so the :58 identity layer in in marketing if you and in terms of positioning is :05 one that's often neglected because we focus on the functional things that :10 people do in the short term but when you start introducing that future identity piece about selling people on and you :16 know indicating who they become not only do you convert more people in the front end because you're taking away the risk :23 of change but you also get better buying in the application of that delivery because everybody's agreed that there's :29 a bigger payoff at the end because everybody's up leveled in the process of doing it got it so it's about figuring :36 out what that vision is so that you can paint it for your client it's not figuring out is giving it to them :43 because the brutal truth is most people LA Vision for themselves and for their lives but if you can paint a picture :48 that's desirable to them at least put lead them toward the promised land and and and they understand it and :55 what the alod dontist might find that he starts playing golf but he's better off that he loved :00 volunteering at the dog shelter but you gave him the space and the time to do that but via a mutual :06 investment and you both and you both committed to play the game so so giving them a future identity is about :12 spelling that out about what they become and who they become and then allowing that allowing that to unfold and :18 allowing them to discover it I have a concept called The Sovereign consultant I have that's a I'm :24 selling people on being a sovereign consultant who makes a million dollars profit a year in two days a week with :31 65 clients or less right what when you get there how you do it what you want to enjoy in the teams if you :37 want to work three days a week go for it but at least we got to it at least we agreed on the on the on the endpoint and :45 and we both understand that the map is in the terrain and the system I give people is is a coloring book :51 that you buy I give you guidelines and boundaries and don't color outside that line but the Stop Needing, Start Attracting :59 colors you put in in in between are completely up to you yeah and final sorry with with help :08 of course and guidance yeah yeah of course final question there how do you put :14 in your Outreach or your content I'm thinking of someone :20 who messaged me last week hey Katen if I if I could add $50,000 a month to what :28 you're doing if it's $50,000 a month in your business and in the next 60 :35 days my my immediate thought and I

do it to one person we can we can do it with a 100 got it and :37 then the big vision is the two hours or two days a week million dollars a year what does that mean to you where do you :43 want to go with it Etc let's let's get some results together first let's let's put an offer together that :49 you can sell in ways that that are effortless to you compared to maybe what you've and how you've done it :54 before if we get one if we get one is their belief that we can get two 10 and :00 and 100 yeah it's your your weekly pricing thing which is just lower the :06 now number instead of a th a month it's 250 a week so people can get in but it's the same with believability lower :13 than now believability do you think we could have an offer that you're ready to sell next week yeah that's believable :20 it's what I want versus Pie in the Sky guarantee 100K a month in two :27 months and nobody hits it because they didn't do the 12 things every single day on the :35 guarantee the title is old as time do you yeah do you get people asking :41 because I struggled with this when I I defined the big Vision which for me was it was 200k a year :48 you're working 20 hours a week on your agency and you're taking home 200k :53 a year and I would get a lot of people being well who how many people have :59 done that and is that something how do you do it what's :04 the model they're they're so they get fixated on this Vision as if :09 it's the gospel truth when really it's just look if it's 150 for you not :15 200 that's fine do you get that thing and and if so what do you say to it I I don't I don't get it at all but I :22 have a I have a distinct advantage that I am my own case :29 study so if I put my own mask on First and do fun things with fun people and :34 make lots of money I just say to people do you want something this or your :40 version of it and they go okay and if you don't have that Advantage which is :46 extremely meta do what you teach and teach what you do then you only need one example I've I've seen :55 plenty of cases where someone's just got one ideal case study that they leverage :00 to get a hundred more of those people as the ideal case study so the magical number in these in the in the course of :06 demonstration is usually one right because one leads to two yeah and if you :11 can demonstrate that you can that you can do it once and you can demonstrate :17 you understand the principle success in that and the Strategic level of mechanisms and the vision level of of :25 identity that you that you paint a picture of then you will have more results and more case studies than you :31 can shake a stick out but it it all started with one and I've :37 got rich by getting other people Rich right yeah it's it's it's and the more I :44 I work to that ideal and and then layer enjoyment over the top of it then the :50 better it all works for everybody very cool okay okay so you have a book More of James's Secret :56 tell everybody where they can find the book and then we'll end this thing The Sovereign consultant

. Right? The the key piece, and the piece of both. The other piece of experimentation is around converting those those book customers into clients. So I've done 2 things, and I'm gonna double down on one of these things. and discard the other just through experimentation. So the 1st one is putting them on a wait list. And if you want the wait list again, it's in the waitlist training in in the classroom. ## Live Workshops: A High-Leverage Path to Client Acquisition **Summary:** Live workshops are a highly effective method for converting customers to clients. They provide valuable content, increase time on brand, and offer a natural opportunity to pitch client programs. A converting live workshop can also become a standalone product, further increasing leverage. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** I'm going to double down on live workshops for 2 reasons. A live workshop is a better product than a static course. So I'm gonna change my $200 upsell into a a course and a program and bonuses. But it's around a live workshop. and a live workshop is a much higher converting path from customers to clients right? We know around here that, people can easily get 10 to 40% of people who come to a workshop into their community or client program. If I was starting from scratch I would sell a live workshop in the funnel and get people who buy the book into that into that live workshop and ultimately pitch the client program from there. ## Book Funnel Templates, the Sovereign Book Club, and Done-For-You Services **Summary:** James Kemp offers funnel templates and announces the Sovereign Book Club, an 8-week program to help participants create, market, and launch their own book funnels. A done-for-you service is also available for those who prefer to outsource the process. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So 2 things left. We've got some swipes. Chris has put together way more than I asked him to. He's massively over delivered. We've got creative swipes. We got the copy swipes. and we've got the funnel template.

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The Sovereign Consultant model is about building a life that a business feeds. Most people want a good life, and the cash flow, impact, and meaning a business provides can feed that life. It's easy to stay at the surface level of strategy, but tactics and strategies alone are volatile and exhausting. Principles and philosophy guide strategy and lower volatility. My calendar demonstrates what's important to me: daily exercise, date night, family dinner, client group calls, and calls only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This creates space for creativity and flow. You don't earn the right to free space; you choose it. Intentional time management dictates results. The Sovereign way is about leverage and serving the maximum number of people. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Building a Brand **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a three-step process for building a strong brand: defining and selling a unique mechanism, crafting an aspirational identity, and building a world around your brand. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A brand is what people say about you when you're not there. The ideal brand does all the selling. Three components: world, identity, and mechanisms. Start with the mechanism – the way you get results. It needs to be unique (yours) and work. Examples: Daily Client Machine (lead magnet with a self-liquidating offer), Customers to Clients (low-ticket workshops with an offer), Hybrid Offer (selling via documents). Next, craft an aspirational identity. What does someone become when they commit to your world? JK's "Cash Creators" is a great example. Finally, world-building. People buy who you are more than what you do. World-building is an abstraction of your reality. Components: characters, language, places, storylines, memes. My world: The Brazilian, Mr. 13, Miss 7, the cat, the dog, Bali, my journey back to $3 million. Have fun with it (oat milk, Atomic Habits). ``` ============================================================
