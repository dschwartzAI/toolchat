# business Framework - Complete Guide & sending Framework - Complete Guide

# business Framework

## Overview

The business is a comprehensive framework for business transformation.

## Complete Framework

The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.
There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We sign them up for an ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes and timelines along the duration.
Why People Buy
There are Four Core Reasons people buy help:
Make more money ● Save money ● Stay legal ● Live a better life
You only solve for one Core.
All other benefits are exactly that, benefits.
The difference between two companies:
Help business owners build business systems to free up time so they can make
more money (better life)
Help business owners build business systems to make more money so they can
have more time (more money)
Both businesses ‘do’ the same thing.
Yet both companies will attract a very different type of customer.
If you offer both as your core benefit both you and your client will be confused.
Personally I solve for making money.

# sending Framework

## Overview

I eventually automated the whole invitation and sending process via something I call The Cash Campaign but that story is for another day.

## Complete Framework

with a simple Google doc.
I eventually automated the whole invitation and sending process via something I call The Cash Campaign but that story is for another day.
It worked for one reason.
The offer and the 5 components it needs to contain.
Offers are everything. Up to $3m they ARE the business. One offer can do it all.
I've gone on to sell millions from plane old Google Docs using the 5 components.
Every time an offer flops for me I've skipped one of them.
I've put together everything I know about Offer creation and the 5 components in The Offer Code.
It takes you step by step through and gives you two templates to swipe and use yourself. Including the highest converting offer I've ever created.
The Offer Code is available until next Thursday for $100. A whopping $400 off the regular investment.

Tomorrow I'll be telling you about a special event I'll be holding for folks who pick up this training.

An offer is the business.
Based on your replies yesterday: that hit home.
One great offer that's easy to buy, fun to sell and simple to deliver is all you need.
