# Clients Framework - Complete Guide & build Framework - Complete Guide

# Clients Framework

## Overview

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert.

## Complete Framework

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The DCM™
This system creates Leads and Customers.
You then engage with a customer to understand the intent and desire behind their action.
It creates a short term focus that is most likely to generate results over the shortest time period.
Efficiency.
It also captures those who do not display immediate intent so you can convert them into prospects via qualification/conversation or convert them into customers in the future.
The Daily Client Machine™
[There appears to be a diagram showing three connected boxes: "The Offer Code Template" -> "The Offer Code Product" -> "The Syndicate", with labels underneath: "Create A Lead" -> "Create A Customer" -> "Create A Client"]
Lead Flow vs Lead Conversion
A critical distinction in lead generation is flow vs conversion.
When people say they 'need more leads' my first goal is to determine whether they need more lead flow vs need more lead conversion.
Flow is the volume and conversion is the action.
The majority of people have a lead conversion bottleneck rather than a lead flow bottleneck.
You have enough leads, just no efficient way to convert them into customers and/or clients.
The most efficient way is to make an offer(s).. This allows the leads to self-select and demonstrate intent and narrows your focus to those who've demonstrated intent.
If you're not making enough sales yet have even a tiny audience that you're communicating with, focusing on lead conversion before lead flow will yield the highest results.
The Individual Components:

There are only two key components inside The Daily Client Machine, your Big Idea and your Customer Offer.
Armed with both you will get all the leads and customers you can handle.
The Big Idea
Illumination - Pain, Problem and Opportunity Unaware Offer: Lead Magnet Goal: Opt In
Customer Offer
Indoctrination - Pain and Problem Aware Offer: $50-$100 Digital Product Goal: Consumption and Implementation
The easiest way is to illustrate with an

Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it’s skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.
The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The Hybrid Offer™
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is ‘simple’, it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it’s easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.

# build Framework

## Overview

You help business owners build systems free up time so they can make more money.

## Complete Framework

. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate. If you, if you're writing, marketing and messaging organically, or if you move to ads and then add start working, it doesn't add to just amplification of good content. But good content is created from good messaging, which is, which is created from good office. James Kemp: So I need you to understand the sequence, because the sequence is what delays most people because they work front to back, whereas we were back to front. James Kemp: So let's get into the hybrid offer. James Kemp: So traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for durations. James Kemp: It's simple, but it's just easier than simple. That's why the majority use it right? So the hybrid addresses this by selling a rock across a range of prices and times with a single offer. James Kemp: Simplicity is having one offer. and you only need one offer. James Kemp: and there is a useful distinction between offers and products is really made. You need a lot of ways to make the offer. James Kemp: But you don't need many products, and you don't need many actual offers. So hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it. So we sign them up for an ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes and timelines along the duration. James Kemp: Before we get to that James Kemp: we've got to define. Why, people buy. And again, the more variables that you insert here, the longer it takes to get results. James Kemp: But there are 4 core reasons. People buy help James Kemp: to make more money to save money, to stay legal or live a better life. James Kemp:, and the majority of people that sit in the make more money all have a better life. buckets James Kemp: stay legal as compliance, and some of those and some of those are real blue oceans because people really need them., and save money is a different market altogether. But saving money can be a, a core benefit of people who often save people. Time James Kemp: you only solve for one core James Kemp: and all the other benefits that are are exactly that they are benefits. James Kemp: So there's a huge difference between these 2 businesses. You help business owners build systems free up time so they can make more money. You help business owners build systems to make more money, so they can have more time. James Kemp: Both businesses do the same thing. James Kemp: The functional things they do but are the same. Yet both companies will attract a very different type of customer. James Kemp: because one is seeking a better life. and it's in a different stage usually, and one is seeking more money. James Kemp: And if you offer both James Kemp: as your core benefit. Both you and your client will be confused. James Kemp: and we see this all the time. That direct, that getting away from the core and talking about all the benefits. James Kemp: confuses you and confuses the market. Right? So personally, I solve for making money. James Kemp: and the stem of that is from one of my core beliefs that true freedom is downstream from from financial freedom. James Kemp: So the core piece about me and my orientation towards the market is making money
