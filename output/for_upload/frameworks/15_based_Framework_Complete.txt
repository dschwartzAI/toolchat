.3 million us at the time then I did that again and then I did it again and the formula to this day works the formula of having a very high margin coaching training Consulting product that shows someone how to get a defined result over a defined time period that's sold for5 plus th000 via the telephone if you want the absolute fastest way to grow start and grow a profitable coaching Consulting business in 2025 the answer has been the same for about 8 years do that that is the fastest way because what you will do is have the highest margin product and as long as you f the product to the market you will have demand for it you as long as you can have a promise that people want they want to make money they want a better body a better relationship a better life whatever it may be there's only four categories I've covered them many times look out the videos make money save money live a better life or stay at a jail you got to be selling in one of those categories the absolute fastest way to sell that is on the telephone the absolute fastest way is to get people on the phone understand their current state understand the gap between the current state and their desired future State present your program as the desired future State and and then get their money and then put them in something that's high leverage to deliver you can get to multiple six figures a month doing that if you spend every waking hour hustling posting content to get people on the phone you get them on the phone and you sell 40% to 50% of those people into that product you'll make a ton of money you'll get some of those people results depending on your skill level how experienced you are how good you are the scope of the promise Etc that's the most variables that to this day is the absolute fastest way to do it the reason I'm not doing that is that it's a young man's game and what I realized after years and years of doing that the trade-offs that have to happen in the pursuit of growth and the pursuit of money are not trade-offs that I'm prepared to make so nowadays I have programs with defined promises I have a mentorship program that has no promises whatsoever it just allow people to look over my shoulder and share insights with them and and give them office hours a couple of times we where they can ask me questions it doesn't have a single promise in the world it's solded via a Google doc I will not get on a call I will only get on a call with people who invest in consulting or I've invested in them in terms of taking them as a coaching client and commitment or they're in The Syndicate and part of the mentorship and the reason that the call based system as a as a young man's game is requires a lot of energy and a lot of time and at my stage of life I have two children both of them over there right now I have two dogs both of them over there right now I have another child on the way I have a wonderful relationship I love to travel I love to do absolutely nothing for long periods of time I love to stuff around I'm wearing these clothes cuz I'm about to go on an hourong walk and listen to a podcast before our Chef arrives and cook and and Cooks us dinner tonight I don't want to be on the telephone all the time I want to spend time doing those things I want to spend time with the kids I want to spend time swing my pool I want to spend time chasing the dogs on the beach I want to spend time with my soon to be new wife and the the the young man's game is the fastest way to make money because you can deploy a lot of energy into it you can get people on the phone you can hustle you can grind you can do all those things and you make a ton of money and you might want to keep doing that or you might want to take it to the next level where you start hiring people you build a sales team to sell that you

because those outcomes are a bu product of the action and the work that people ultimately do so selling supposedly intangible things becomes very simple when you point at things that they are buying you point at incentives that they have to to do it right now and you point at ultimately the distinct outcomes that they have and those outcomes monetary outcomes are are easy for people to Value but outcomes that are behavioral or or that show up in people's lives so you can have more intimacy every day be become much more tangible than these generic ideas every offer can be made tangible it just requires a little bit of looking and and know stepping back from the mixing up of the of the correlation and the causation of the work that you do I personally help people make money they do the work and they they get the outcomes and they get the benefits and they use that money to do things you know which is the a lot of the other stuff I talk about they do use that money to live a better life but at the end of the day I point at the outcomes I point the mechanism and I point at the things that that people can see and value and that works no matter what you sell What's Working in 2025 To Get High Ticket Clients I ran my first Facebook ad in 2017 so I guess I'm a veteran back in the back in the day when you were own a Facebook ad you could get a booked call and sell someone a very expensive you know Consulting program for about 50 in the time New Zealand dollars so you could run an ad get someone to a vsl convince them that you knew what you were talking about understand what they needed prove prove that you understand what they needed get them on a call and sell them a $22 to $10,000 Consulting program and people still do that to this day and it doesn't cost $50 anymore and everybody I talked to who still runs core funnels and still runs ads to them always report costs going up the only exception in this and one of the biggest Moes that people have these days is someone with a brand if you've got a large person brand a large brand on YouTube or on Instagram or one of those where people are pre-sold on you then you book a core funnels and these things still really work most people don't have a large personal brand Everybody's Got a Brand but most people don't have a large manufactured intentional personal brand and so in 2025 you are steering into the headwinds of a low trust environment the fact is that lots of people have been making lots of big bold crazy in many cases unrealistic promises and we are in a low trust environment and back 10 years ago just your Boomer parents would believe every sing single thing on the news people believed every single thing they saw on the internet and they bought the claims they bought the promises and they bought into everything and you know you could pretty much sell anything these days we are in a very low trust environment and that means the the marketing and the force that people are putting into marketing to try and convince people of those things is a it's less effective because we're in a low trust environment and B there's just way more people doing it so the the the signal to noise ratio has changed dramatically and so that brings us to the present day so 24 hours ago I ran a workshop and on that Workshop ironically I showed people my workshop process of how I sell Workshop tickets for $100 and how I generate multiple thousand High ticket customers off the back of that and one of the things that we did in the Q&A so we went for about 2 and a half hours and about half of that is teaching and about half of that is just Q&A where I just help people one of the things I said in that environment is that we have to give people an experience the days are are are they're not gone but they're coming to an end where people will be nurtured through a multi step funnel where they'll see lots and lots of pieces of content and eventually
