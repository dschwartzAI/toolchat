## Overview

** Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best.

## Complete Framework

. Sell an experience, not just features. Make the offer tangible by describing the physical experience of the desired outcome or the removal of the problem. Focus on selling relief—a better tomorrow—and make the offer a clear path to that relief. Tangibility and a clear vision make offers easy to sell. ## Offer Distinction and Positioning: Standing Out in Competitive Markets **Summary:** Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best. He advises using unique naming and framing the offer as an "install" to reduce the perception of labor. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** In competitive markets, distinction is key. If you can't be the best, be the easiest. Use unique naming and frame your offer as an "install," reducing the perception of labor. Develop a monopoly on your unique mechanism or process. Content builds context, establishing your expertise and making the offer a natural next step. ## Pricing for Conversions and Economics: The Path of Least Resistance **Summary:** Kemp advocates for pricing that maximizes conversions and economics, often meaning being among the cheapest but most accessible in the market. He advises against high pricing driven by ego and emphasizes the power of $100 offers. Video Source:* source: 3k per week.txt **Content:** Price for maximum conversions and economics. Accessibility is key; often, the cheapest offers are the most effective. Avoid inflated pricing driven by ego or status seeking. There's a magic to $100 offers; they work exceptionally well. Focus on delivering value and earning the right to experiment with higher pricing later. ## The 6-Month Plan: Principles, Playbooks, and Client Ascension **Summary:** Kemp outlines a 6-month plan for building a sustainable, scalable business, focusing on the principles of market selection, offer creation, and client ascension. He introduces playbooks for execution and emphasizes the importance of volume and speed in skill development. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The plan involves selecting the right market, creating a compelling offer, and building an ecosystem for client ascension. Playbooks provide actionable steps. Volume and speed enhance skill development; the more you do, the faster you learn and improve. Focus on leveraged actions that compound over time. Everything works with enough volume and iteration. ## Managing Expectations and Pacing: Sustainable Growth and Reduced Volatility **Summary:** Kemp advises setting a sustainable pace and managing expectations, emphasizing the importance of slow, steady growth to reduce volatility and avoid burnout. He recommends using time as a variable and focusing on the process, not just the outcome. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Define a sustainable pace. Processes take time; reverse engineer from your goals and set a pace you can sustain. Manage expectations, especially around speed of return. Slow, steady growth reduces volatility and prevents burnout. Use time to your advantage; the slower you grow, the higher your revenue floor and the lower your volatility. ## Dynamic Offers and Client Lifetime Value: Maximizing Potential **Summary:** Kemp discusses maximizing client lifetime value by offering multiple tiers and crediting previous investments. He encourages open communication about different program levels and making upgrades and downgrades natural and tension-free. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Display different program levels early and often. Credit previous investments to encourage upgrades. This injects potential energy into the system and makes ascension conversations easier. Make it personal and work out custom payment plans based on credits. This approach maximizes client lifetime value and fosters long-term relationships. ## Addressing Client Questions and Objections: Handling "Not Now" **Summary:** Kemp advises addressing client questions directly and handling objections by taking the offer off the table, creating space for honest feedback. He emphasizes the value of a "not now" response and using it as an opportunity for further conversation

. the easier they are to convert into becoming a client, and the longer they stay in your world. . We've been talking a little bit over the last couple of weeks about content. my Youtube strategy and my video strategy. And that's about, brand Width, it's about getting people on brand and consuming one or some or all of the ideas that you have. So by the time that they're reaching out, or you're having a conversation about an offer. they are already sold on those things, and you are the origin of them. ## Books as Evergreen Assets and Client Generation Tools **Summary:** Books are highly evergreen marketing assets, remaining relevant and effective for years. They offer excellent value and can generate clients even without complex funnels, though distribution and economics are key for maximizing their potential. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So in the Internet space. And in in the online space the rate of change is super super high, things come and go and they fizzle out and they disappear really, really, quickly, and their effectiveness and a book is an interesting one, because as an asset, it's 1 of the most evergreen I can't think of an asset that's more evergreen than a book, really, because even a workshop or a webinar would need a that can, that they can feasibly run for years, they still need to be changed and refreshed and updated where there are plenty of examples of books that are 10 or even 15 years old that are still selling in the market today. ## Creating a Book: A Simpler Process Than You Think **Summary:** Creating a client-getting book is often simpler than anticipated, frequently achievable in a weekend or less by compiling existing materials. The most time-consuming aspect is editing for readability and usability. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So how do we create a book? It is a lot simpler than you think. The creation of all my books has been done in a weekend or less right because they were. They were compiled, and amalgamations of things that are already done honestly, that the most of the time spent on books is editing. So editing is just making it readable and making it usable. And once you've got a baseline down then most of the time is making it editable, making it readable and making it consumable. ## How-To Books and Mechanism Books: Delivering Results and Converting Clients **Summary:** How-to books that provide complete solutions are most effective for client conversion. Books focused on a single mechanism are also highly effective, especially for problem-oriented solutions. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So I I believe that the best books and I have found that the best books are how to books. They give everybody. They give somebody everything they need to ultimately fulfill on the idea. So they tell them. You tell them how to do the thing so they could spend $10 with you and do that, or they could spend a hundred grand with you, and, and get you to do it for them. So books that hold back create customers that will hold back on you. So if you leave out the secret ingredients or leave out the key thing out of the book. You will find that that book doesn't ultimately convert people books that give people everything in terms of the central idea and the central concepts., indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person. ## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism **Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop

., indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person. ## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism **Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So there's 2 types of books that we can create. The 1st one is the big idea. the one that completely sells them and if you want to get more context on the sovereign consultant and the pieces of how I assembled that watch the authority training in the classroom. but the big idea completely sells them on your whole vision, your whole world, who they who they can become what they need, what they need to do next, and and ultimately how they do it. The the why, what, how, so? The sovereign consultant is A is an example of a big idea book. It's a big idea that creates the idea of what a sovereign consultant is. what they need to do to do it, and how to do it. As they unpack the chapters. So, the the Big Idea book is more of the book than our book, slightly contradicting what I said before, but it's it's ultimately the the big idea. the second type of book which I'm confident that 80% of you have now is a book that's just about a single mechanism. ## From Trainings to Books: Leveraging Existing Content **Summary:** Existing training materials and workshops can be easily repurposed into books. Transcribing workshops and blending them with training documents provides a substantial base for a book, requiring primarily editing and structuring. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** So the sovereign consultant book is created from 4 trainings. So there's a software consultant the the simplest path to a million dollars profit a year. You can see that training. You can see that it's got a Google Doc attached to it. The hybrid offer customers to clients in the data client machine. So, as I said, I will create 3 more books based on those mechanisms. So I will have an interconnected world of books that that point to each other and cross reference each other. Because I've already got the baseline of those books. So what I did is, I created a training. I ran the workshop. I got the workshop transcribed, and then I blended the the original training Doc, because I do my trainings in in Google Docs. And I blended that with the transcript of the of the workshop. The average hour long workshop generates about 17 to 24,000 words depending on how fast you speak. That's a book right? There is editing required, but you can have something usable and drop it into drop it into those, and I'm going to give you the book and the outline, and in a more readable and raw format. ## Simplifying the Book Creation Process: Focusing on Client Acquisition **Summary:** Client-getting books should be viewed as enhanced lead magnets or condensed workshops, focusing on client acquisition rather than being complex literary works. This approach simplifies the process and allows for quicker client generation. Video Source:* Book Funnel Workshop.txt **Content:** This is a lead magnet on steroids or a reduction of a workshop. Right? And again, most people here have done both of those things, and the book is the happy middle ground in terms of the asset that is created from those, and also an asset that ultimately we can put into something that's got bit better economics

## How to Apply
