## Overview

The common approach is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.

Constructing Your Daily Client Machine
How To Generate Leads Hourly, Customers Daily and Clients Weekly
The Sequence - The Order of Events Matters
To hit $1m, it is critical we attack it in the right order.
The common approach is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it's to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it's skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.

The Sequence
The common approach is to work ‘forwards’ from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it’s to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
At a strategic level, we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Promote Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly

Only 4% of your Customers need to convert to Clients to hit your numbers.
We choose pricing that maximises conversions and economics.
I have 5 years of data behind this and I’m giving you the shortcut:
Community offers at $100-$200 per week and a $3k PIF work the widest range of markets.
Consulting offers at $300-$600 sell to the right people in the right ratios.
$100 Customer Offers convert 5-15% of buyers into Clients
This is the path of least resistance.
You ‘can’ charge higher prices. You ‘can’ use 7, 9’s and angel numbers.
It’s more likely to divert you from the path than keep you on it.
Creativity is better deployed into your products and clients.
You earn the right to experiment after you have followed the simple path.

. If I generate leads, then therefore I should. James Kemp: This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage is. there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of ads. You can run hundreds of variables on the front ends James Kemp: that you need to find the one or 2 that works. James Kemp: So if you start with hundreds of variables, and then there's 20 different ways to sell it. Then you need to decipher all those variables, and most people fail James Kemp: because they're being sold to by marketers whose default choice is marketing. James Kemp: and the best way to head a goal is not to work towards it is to work backwards from it James Kemp: because working fords is chaotic because there's so many potential variables, there's hundreds of ways to market and lot of them work. There's hundreds of ways to sell and a lot of them work. James Kemp: But working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage. James Kemp: because over a long enough time period and everybody's tried that we all have both approaches, get you to the goal, but working backwards, gets you there faster and with more certainty. James Kemp: So we're going to do 3 things James Kemp: we're going to create and validate a threek offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc. And that's what we're going to focus on today. James Kemp: We're going to create and sell a customer offer that converts 5% of its buyers into clients for you James Kemp: in that offer that we've just defined. James Kemp: Then we're going to automate the lead flow and the customer offer and Nsn. Customers into clients every week. James Kemp: So we go from making 3 K. And validating that to 3 KA week to 3 KA day. James Kemp: So we use 3 systems to do this. The hybrid offer James Kemp: which I'll talk about today, customers to clients and the daily client machine. James Kemp: The sequence is very, very, very, very important. because each of these systems solve for a specific stage. and we've got a master one before moving to the next one. James Kemp: and that's the right pace. James Kemp: Right? You may be at different stages, and everybody here is at different stages of the current offer of the marketing of the flow. James Kemp: But skipping steps is not speed. I constantly go back and reevaluate my offer based on feedback. James Kemp: One of the reasons that we use Google Docs is because it's dynamic, right? You can put it on the sales page. And those things later. Once you have something that converts at 30 to 40, James Kemp: but it's dynamic. I'm tweaking words. I'm tweaking, positioning all the time. James Kemp: so skipping steps is not speed. It sometimes feels it. I can just jump straight to marketing. I need more leads, so I can just jump jump to that. But it's just skipping steps. James Kemp: So mastery and the sequence compounds. The better your hybrid offer. The more clients you convert. the better your customers to client system, the more customers and clients you generate. and the better your daily client machine, the more leads turn into customers who turn into clients and and it compounds in action. James Kemp: Right? So the sequence is really really important. James Kemp: and syndicate folks know that I just bang on about offers all the time, because it's the big fulcrum. It's the big lever James Kemp: the better your offer the easier everything is the better your offer you don't need to do my selling at all. You just do some invitations the better. Offer the faster your marketing works out of the gate
