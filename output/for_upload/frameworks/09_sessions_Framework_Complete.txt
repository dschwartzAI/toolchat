# productization Framework

## Overview

** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages.

## Complete Framework

> "Yeah, have access to all my trainings on a recurring basis,"
 and with nothing else there. What will that do? I don't know. Will it create a whole cohort of buyers? Yes, it will. What will those buyers do? We will see. What behaviors do they undertake? Do people buy my trainings, and then do a portion of those people then buy one-on-one hours over the top, so they skip out the group components? Possibly. Maybe that's happening at the moment where people are bundling together on their own by buying access to some of my content, but also buying one-on-one hours with me, and skipping over the group component that we have in the Syndicate. For them, that value equation is the most efficient at the relative price point. ## Unbundling for Client Empowerment and Flexibility **Summary:** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages. He emphasizes the importance of offering scalable products and being open to how clients choose to combine them, recognizing that different combinations will appeal to different individuals. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Unbundling allows our audience and our clients and our customers to access the value that they see fit, and as long as we are prepared to do it and prepared to offer it because it's scalable to us, then they can assemble that for us with low complexity. I don't have a preference for what 90% of people buy off me until I do have a preference in terms of, I can help advise them what's the best path to go in. So that means that by unbundling, I allow people to choose their own adventure and assemble things that I can't see. A training plus a one-on-one component would be highly valuable to one person, but highly risky for someone else because they wouldn't be able to extract the value fast enough relative to where they are. So it comes back to us being able to unbundle, and our clients being able to see the value equation and tip it in their favor. ## Addressing Client Objections and Diagnosing Value Equations **Summary:** James discusses how to handle client objections related to price by diagnosing their individual value equations. He emphasizes asking clients what they're trying to achieve rather than directly addressing their price concerns, as this provides valuable context for understanding their needs. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** As with any sales conversation, you're diagnosing their own value equation. So what do they say? What do they perceive value in? I've purposely avoided upselling and downselling because it's part of a sales process, whereas this is part of a productization process. What you're looking for is them to put the truth on the table as to where they perceive value. And then you've got the option to present how you would deliver against that value. I'll give you two real examples. When I launched the Circle, I said to two people, "You don't need it." One person said, 
> "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it."
