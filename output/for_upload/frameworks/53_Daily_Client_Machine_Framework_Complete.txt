## Overview

This guide is for users who already have the DCM 2.

## Complete Framework

Constructing Your Daily Client Machine
How To Generate Leads Hourly, Customers Daily and Clients Weekly
The Sequence - The Order of Events Matters
To hit $1m, it is critical we attack it in the right order.
The common approach is to work 'forwards' from marketing to sales to offer.
This is deeply flawed because of the number of variables at each stage.
The best way to hit a goal is not to work towards it, it's to work backwards from it.
Working forwards is chaotic because there are so many potential variables.
Working backwards is methodical because it reduces the variables to only the ones that move you to the next stage.
Over a long enough time period, both approaches get you to the goal, but working backwards gets you there faster and with more certainty.
Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it's skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.

The Daily Client Machine 2.0
How To Generate Leads, Customers and Clients Fast
Setting The Scene: Efficient Market Dynamics
Client serving businesses are set up to… serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace will not become a client. Over a long enough time period, clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. But efficiency is finding ways to shorten time periods.
Long sales cycles suck and are hard to scale.
Therefore, we must have efficient ways to identify who is most likely to become a client as early as possible.
Plus, it’s useful to generate cashflow from those who will never become clients in efficient ways.
Traditional Lead Generation
Traditional lead generation and acquisition is a game of large numbers.
Feed 1,000 people in the top.

“Nurture” them while each one slowly drops off.
Get 30 clients out the other end—if you’re good and lucky.
There are numerous issues with this approach. It works when the cost of generating a lead is low enough to waste 97% of the product of a system.
No systems on earth that waste 97% of their output have stood the test of time.
This approach only caters to one type of buying path.
The search for “the best” funnel is an endless one when the constraints are pre-determined.

Dual Mode Client Generation
The 2.0 approach deals with reality:
What we really want is clients, not buckets of leads.
We can use those who won’t immediately (or ever) become clients to fund our marketing
to get clients.
We can monetize IP we have already built.
We can shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness
prospects.
Dual Mode means we generate Leads and Customers at the same time using the same ideas.
We make information about our system freely available to consume, then funnel the attention into action.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction (i.e., get someone to give you money).
To get money, you must gain attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Two Buying Types
We need people to consume our ideas (and us) to buy into them.
The key word is consume.
One path a buyer can take:
Consumes information
Derives insight on how it could work for them
Takes the next step and puts the insight into action
The other:

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The DCM™
This system creates Leads and Customers.
You then engage with a customer to understand the intent and desire behind their action.
It creates a short term focus that is most likely to generate results over the shortest time period.
Efficiency.
It also captures those who do not display immediate intent so you can convert them into prospects via qualification/conversation or convert them into customers in the future.
The Daily Client Machine™
[There appears to be a diagram showing three connected boxes: "The Offer Code Template" -> "The Offer Code Product" -> "The Syndicate", with labels underneath: "Create A Lead" -> "Create A Customer" -> "Create A Client"]
Lead Flow vs Lead Conversion
A critical distinction in lead generation is flow vs conversion.
When people say they 'need more leads' my first goal is to determine whether they need more lead flow vs need more lead conversion.
Flow is the volume and conversion is the action.
The majority of people have a lead conversion bottleneck rather than a lead flow bottleneck.
You have enough leads, just no efficient way to convert them into customers and/or clients.
The most efficient way is to make an offer(s).. This allows the leads to self-select and demonstrate intent and narrows your focus to those who've demonstrated intent.
If you're not making enough sales yet have even a tiny audience that you're communicating with, focusing on lead conversion before lead flow will yield the highest results.
The Individual Components:

There are only two key components inside The Daily Client Machine, your Big Idea and your Customer Offer.
Armed with both you will get all the leads and customers you can handle.
The Big Idea
Illumination - Pain, Problem and Opportunity Unaware Offer: Lead Magnet Goal: Opt In
Customer Offer
Indoctrination - Pain and Problem Aware Offer: $50-$100 Digital Product Goal: Consumption and Implementation
The easiest way is to illustrate with an

Purchases information

Free information has a distribution advantage. Paid information has an attention advantage. Using both is a force multiplier.
The DCM 2.0™
We take the same idea and create two funnels. Each funnel leads to an offer.
The Client Funnel uses an insight path.
The Customer Funnel uses an info path.

The folks in The Syndicate are seeing that the model is pretty much everything.
Drop the skill into the right model and it unlocks the value.
The value is already there in your biz, it's just trapped in a sub-standard model that you've doggedly stuck to despite being stuck at the same revenue level for months.
Because a guru preached focus and shamed you away from changing it up despite it not working.
I'm not going to spend anytime 'selling you' on my model.
If you want to build a big empire with a big team you buy donuts for on Mondays then I'm definitely not your guy.
But I am willing to show you.
And short of becoming a client and joining The Syndicate (which is becoming a scarcer opportunity as I approach our 100 person limit ) what I've got for the next few days is as close as you're going to get.
Since Black Friday is coming up I'm going to use it basically give you 5 of my best trainings.
These strategies literally built this business and the folks inside my world are using them to do the same.
For the next few days or until it's sold out you can get:
The Offer Code, Hybrid Client, Customers To Clients, The Daily Client Machine and The Social Code
For $200.
These trainings will walk you through creating a high converting offer you can sell without calls, generating customers and cashflow you can turn into clients and having a flow of leads coming to you daily.
I know you've heard this all before but this is likely the first time you've been allowed to

Stacking PIF
Simply having a Pay in Full option in the cart.
I've found you get higher conversion to PIF when it's NOT previously mentioned in the offer.
To maximise, PIF a 'discount' of 25-35% against the total of the pay plan will do it.
Best of Both Worlds
Simply have a PIF in the cart then offer upgrade options during onboarding.
Implementation:
Checklist:
1. Does your offer clearly define The 3 P's? 2. Does your offer use price engineering to maximise conversions and 'yes'? 3. Do you want to stack PIF or Stack LTV (or both)?
Discernment in using this training:
The 3P's will increase the conversions of your offer ● Price Engineering will increase the conversions of your offer and extend LTV ● Stacking will increase your LTV
All of these significantly move the needle. Be discerning when you add them.
If you know your market and audience very well you may choose to use all of the them simultaneously.
If you're just getting rolling, use them one at a time to boost conversions if your focus is making more sales or boost LTV if your focus is creating more value from the sales you're currently making.

Subject: An Offer So Good It's Insulting Body: Yesterday I launched the Black Friday.
And among the dozens of purchase and glowing praise from people who owned one of the trainings and are delighted to get more was this:
"Are you trying to insult me?
I've paid $300 for IC, DCM, SC
And now you offer me that plus 2 more for $200!
Where's my special offer for already believing in you and spending my $300...
Give me the extra 2 for free, that would be the right thing to do."
To which I promptly refunded all his previous purchases, told him he could keep access, never to buy any of my products again and wished him all the best.
Because you don't need customers who think like this.
And you surely don't need clients who think like this.
When an opportunity drops in their lap, immediately looking around for how they've been wronged, no one gets them and someone should bow down and save them.

4. Automate lead flow and Customer sales and stack recurring revenue that compounds
into $3k per day
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ to generate $3k 2. Customers to Clients™ to generate $3k a week and per day 3. The Daily Client Machine™to generate $3k per day recurring
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
The Sovereign Brand
Size does not matter.
There is no audience too small to get traction quickly.
Actually, the smaller the better in the beginning.
The myth of needing big followings and a huge track record are just that. Myths. Sold by people
who have big followings and gate keep via experience.
You need to have solved one problem once for yourself or someone else and know how to solve
it again.
Nothing more.
A brand is the thing people say about you when you're not there.
You live rent free in someone's head and they associate you with ideas and imagery.
The end point of a brand is to promote action.
When your brand consistently sells someone on ideas and imagery it is very easy to get them to
take action.
It's the natural next step.
The ideal brand does all the selling needed.
Then when an offer is made it's the natural next step.
Creating a brand like this is not easy but it is simple.
There's 3 components:

Future buyers and customers captured early
Faster cashflow and marketing scale
31% of email list are buyers
Higher conversion rates on future offers
Enhancing Lead Generation Efficiency
James discussed the inefficiencies of traditional lead generation systems, highlighting that only 1-5% of an audience typically converts to clients, resulting in significant waste. He emphasized the need for scalable and controlled systems to identify potential clients early and generate cash flow during growth. James also explained different client types, from those investing in long-term coaching to occasional buyers, and stressed the importance of adapting strategies to the evolving market. He concluded that while traditional lead generation methods still work, they are not sustainable for long-term growth and need to be improved for better efficiency and scalability.
Unified Funnel Strategy Integration
James discussed his work on integrating two distinct funnel approaches into a unified strategy. He explained how the dual-mode client generation system can use non-client buyers to fund marketing efforts while targeting high-quality prospects. James outlined two main buying types: one focused on consuming information and deriving insight, and another on purchasing and consuming information. He emphasized that both approaches have their advantages and can be used together to create a more effective funnel system. James also touched on the importance of understanding the context around offers, including what happens before and after the offer itself.
Marketing Strategies and Content Optimization
James discussed various marketing strategies, including hybrid offers, daily client machines, and video-based content. He emphasized the importance of using a style that is native to the presenter and highlighted the significance of the headline in driving conversions for big idea videos and VSLs. James also explained the concept of insight funnels, starting with high-tier offers and downselling if necessary, and discussed the effectiveness of different ad formats for low-ticket funnels. He concluded by explaining the DCM (Daily Client Machine) concept and the importance of presenting the same core ideas in different formats to appeal to different buying types.

Broken down we work in this order:
1. Create and validate $3k Offer by making 3 sales from a simple Google Doc 2. Create and sell Customer Offer that converts 5% of buyers into Clients 3. Automate lead flow and Customer Offer and ascend Customers into Clients weekly
We go from making $3k to $3k a week to $3k a day.
We use 3 systems to do this:
1. The Hybrid Offer™ 2. Customers to Clients™ 3. The Daily Client Machine™
Each of these systems solve for a specific stage.
Mastering one before moving to the next one is the pace.
Skipping steps is not speed, it’s skipping steps.
Mastery in this sequence compounds.
The better your Hybrid Offer the more Clients you convert. The better your Customers to Clients system the more Customers AND Clients you generate. The better your Daily Client Machine the more Leads turn into Customers who turn into Clients. Compounding in action.
The Hybrid Offer™
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is ‘simple’, it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it’s easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.

The World you build, The Identity you craft and the Mechanisms you use.
Inside the World you build there are characters, settings, language and story lines. When a
world is in motion people can't help but pay attention.
The Identity is the one you represent yourself and the characteristics of who someone becomes
when they are inside your world. The transition and transformation of the human into their
ideals.
The Mechanisms are the way to get there. The map and the terrain of what must done for the
World to come to life and for The Identity to be manifested.
A brand can be successful with just one of these components, the best ones have all 3.
In order of fastest to slowest in terms of ROI:
1) Define and Sell Your Mechanism

The way you get results.
The only defining characteristic of your mechanism is that it needs to be unique.
It matters much more that it’s yours than what it does.
The underlying mechanism must work.
The underlying mechanism does not need to be yours.
But it must be positioned as unique and sprinkled with unique twists:
The Daily Client Machine = Lead magnet with a self liquidating offer Customers to Clients = low ticket workshops with an offer The Hybrid Offer = selling via doc
I invented none of these things. I just innovated on them and own the mechanism around them.
You don’t need many. One will do.
2) Craft An Aspirational Identity
Identity manifests from a core question:
Who does someone become when they commit to your world?
What ideal characteristics do they attain on an individual and societal level.
If we see our identity is a transaction with society then we can use currencies to define it.

Ideal Components
1. Training and Templates 2. Live Workshop 3. Call (if looking for call volume)
Guidelines:
Solve a single problem, deliver a single result • Sell them what they want, give them what they need • Magic pills sell in large numbers • Repurpose - use something you've already created • Small sum of larger part
Behind The Offer Code:
Having a great offer that's easy to sell and easy to buy is essential to businesses <$3m.
Knowing this indicates a moderate to high sophistication level.
I felt an offer training and templates would be a good lead offer as I opened up The Syndicate as it appeals to people who largely already have offers and would like to optimise them.
It plays to my strengths, has a high ROI potential and I had massive amounts of proof that the contents of the training was proven and effective.
Working Example
The Offer Code Daily Client Machine has been running for almost 3 months.
It generates 5-10 leads a day and 1-2 product sales. Double that when ads are running.

Paid Growth
I run basic ads with a small budget. Lead costs sit between $3-$8. With the conversion rate on The Offer Code it means the ads are essentially free.

Yesterday Andrew asked:
"I don't have any customers yet, let alone clients. I'm literally just starting my consulting journey and don't plan to launch until Feb next year. Is the content you're offering of value to me at such an early stage? I could be wrong but It feels like content your offering is for businesses further down the path."
My answer?
"It’s the fundamentals. Everyone needs those no matter the stage.
Start with the Offer Code in the bundle and you’ll have a better grounding than 98% of consultants."
In over a decade of consulting I have seen very, very few businesses consistently apply the fundamentals.
Every time I consult to a large business it's usually re-installing the fundamentals they lost through complexity, expansion and sabotage through boredom.
The fundamentals of a great offer.
A natural sales process.
And magnetic marketing.
Whether you're just getting started or making millions, I'm willing to bet there's a gap in the flow.
It's showing up in one of the three phases:
Not enough Sales Conversion.
Not Enough Lead Conversion.
Not enough Lead Flow.
Sales conversion is solved with the Offer Code.
Lead Conversion with Customers to Clients.
Lead flow with the Daily Client Machine.
All in the ultimate Black Friday Bundle.

performance. He recommended testing with a budget of $2,000 over three weeks to evaluate ad effectiveness.
Marketing Creativity and Customer Transformation
James discussed the challenges of maintaining creativity in marketing, noting that the rapid spread of ideas leads to market fatigue. He emphasized the importance of differentiation and originality in advertising, suggesting that taking concepts from adjacent markets or combining different ideas can be effective. James also touched on the nature of customer buying behavior, distinguishing between those seeking transformation and those looking for information. He concluded that identity and transformational experiences often have more long-term value than specific outcomes or skills.
Workshop Recording Product Strategy
Tom and James discussed the approach to creating a workshop recording product called "Map Your Customer Journey" through the DCM. James advised that info products are better suited for markets where the problem is already known, while insight-based products are more effective for educating customers about problems and solutions. They explored the differences between info and insight funnels, noting that combining both approaches can cater to different buying styles and enhance growth and scalability.
Adapting Marketing Strategies for Success
James and Shevaune discussed the challenges of marketing and selling products in a rapidly changing market. They explored how targeting specific audiences in paid ads can be less effective than reaching existing followers organically. Shevaune shared her experience with unbundling products to address customer needs more effectively. James emphasized the importance of a sustainable marketing strategy that doesn't require constant funnel rebuilding. They agreed that understanding customer needs and adapting to market changes are key to long-term success.
Hybrid Membership Model Strategies
James and Shevaune discussed strategies for client engagement and revenue generation, focusing on blending membership models with coaching to meet clients' varying needs. James shared insights from a mastermind session, highlighting how a voice coach combined annual memberships with on-demand coaching to increase revenue and client retention. Shevaune described her own transition to offering a hybrid model, providing daily voice notes, modules, and occasional calls, noting that only a small percentage of clients actively engage in calls. They emphasized the importance of understanding client preferences and offering flexible access to services, with James encouraging attendees to experiment and build on these ideas.

. I have numerous examples of people reaching out after these posts saying they changed something and got a result. ## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Problems and Plan **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the problems and plan content buckets. Problems involve addressing common audience challenges and offering solutions, while plan demonstrates leadership by outlining a clear direction and vision. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I love seeing people do this. Delivering certainty in uncertain times is crucial. The *plan* is the big daddy of content. It demonstrates leadership. To establish leadership, decide on a direction, define it, and lead others. The plan brings together all other content types. It's a demonstration of certainty. Plans require courage. They work as pillar content. I talked about my path back to $3 million a year. 10 months later, I hit it. It's a demonstration of competence and certainty. Having a plan is essential. "I'm going to do this with this many people." These are effective ways to grow an audience and be relevant. They require courage because you're exposing yourself. My client set a high profit goal. He's not hitting it, so he's writing about why and what he's doing differently. These have a soap opera element. People follow along. Taki had a plan to help 50 coaches to a million a year. It was a narrative he wove through his content. Plans can also take the form of sharing results. "7 things I learned to create a $73k MRR business." Share the insights. ## Building an Audience: Calls to Action and Content Reps **Summary:** James Kemp challenges the conventional wisdom of always including a call to action, suggesting that high-quality content often speaks for itself. He recommends starting with three content pieces per week and increasing frequency as you become more prolific. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Do you have to have a call to action? I have higher performance on posts *without* a CTA. Social media that constantly tells people to do stuff ceases to be social. If the content is good, you'll get a response. You don't need a CTA on every post. If something is time-based, a deadline, or limited spots, it's natural to point it out. What reps are required? Consistency. I write daily, so people think I'll make them do the same. If you can't do it consistently, don't do it. Start with three times a week and increase frequency when you become more prolific. Content reps build content reps. The way to write more is to write more. Establishing the skill makes it easier to deploy. There shouldn't be force in content creation. If you feel forced, narrow it down to be creative and consistent. Your results will vary. Establish a benchmark. ## Buying an Audience: The Daily Client Machine **Summary:** James Kemp discusses buying an audience through paid traffic, highlighting the potential pitfalls of generating low-intent leads. He introduces the Daily Client Machine as a solution for building an audience and converting leads into paying customers. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** The third pillar is *buying*. All leads aren't created equal. You can build huge lists of unresponsive people. Paid traffic is powerful but dangerous. It can generate large volumes of low-intent leads. You build an audience, but not fans. The Daily Client Machine solves this. It builds an audience *and* partitions leads into customers. There are two components: the big idea and the customer offer. Run a simple funnel: ad to landing page to sales page. My ad: "Say goodbye to sales calls." My landing page:

> "Get the exact GDoc template that sold $802,000 of consulting without a sales call."
 80% of landing page results come from the headline. This converts at over 40%, leads are $2.50, and customer purchases pay for the ads. ## Buying an Audience: Leveraging the Daily Client Machine **Summary:** James Kemp explains how the Daily Client Machine can be used for organic growth and shares examples of its implementation, emphasizing the importance of the welcome email in setting expectations. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Get to the template, then the sales page with a customer offer. This is the most efficient way to grow an audience, leads, and convert to customers quickly. It solves the problem of thousands of leads and finding the few who will buy. Turn them into customers early. The Daily Client Machine can also grow organically. Mine go in my social media bios. I still get 20 sign-ups a day. Pay attention to the welcome email. It sets the scene and expectations, and how they can become a customer or client. These are the three ways. An audience is a long-term investment. Short-term actions create long-term results. Think long-term, but manage expectations. Returns are nonlinear. ## A Comprehensive Audience Building Plan **Summary:** James Kemp provides a practical plan for building both a large and high-quality audience, combining elements of borrowing, building, and buying. He emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective and managing expectations. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** People want instant clients from social media and ads. That's not how it works. Borrowing an audience is fastest for trust transfer, but lowest volume. A good plan: *Borrow*: Turn up twice a month to teach. *Build*: Post three times a week on primary and secondary platforms. *Buy*: Run the Daily Client Machine with a $50/day budget, two-step lead magnet, and $100 customer offer. This builds a large, high-quality audience, filters for ready buyers, creates trust transfer, and generates volume. The mixture is up to you. ## Reaching Out to Borrow an Audience **Summary:** James Kemp provides advice on how to approach someone to borrow their audience, suggesting a simple and effective script focused on offering value and demonstrating what's working now. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Everyone got the doc? Is there a script? No. 
> "I've got something cool. I'm doing this. Would it be useful if I shared it with your people?"

## Q&A: Workshopping a Product Idea (DCM) James Kemp: Hi, Tom. Tom Rolley: Hey, James, how's it going. James Kemp: Good. Tom Rolley: I was wondering if we could workshop a potential product through the Dcm Tom Rolley: and just see how you'd approach that. So the, it's a workshop recording. It was called Map your custom journey, and the purpose was to identify the constraint in the business so that they would know which thing to fix Tom Rolley: so yeah, just wondering how you'd approach that from A from this? Dcm, where do I? Where do I start? What do I build. How do I? How do I look at it to get it up? And running. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have. James Kemp: So the consumption of products is generally based on the the need that the person believes they have. James Kemp: So do does the target market know what a customer journey is. Tom Rolley: Oh, gee, maybe. But probably not Tom Rolley: they. Yeah, I'm guessing they probably they're probably just overwhelmed with the amount of stuff going on in their business, and they probably wouldn't recognize that those words. James Kemp: So in the in the realm of the customer. What's the primary problem that they want solved today? Tom Rolley: I think, they're probably they're they're looking for either, increased profits or increased revenue. And then they're not sure what they're trying lots of things, but nothing much is working. And they're just unsure about what even the problem is is most likely. James Kemp: Exactly. James Kemp: That market category isn't good for info products. They're good for insight. James Kemp: Right? Once you catch their attention, you can, show how how to work those things out. And how do you get your top 3 priorities and get them a plan?

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** The Sovereign Consultant model is about building a life that a business feeds. Most people want a good life, and the cash flow, impact, and meaning a business provides can feed that life. It's easy to stay at the surface level of strategy, but tactics and strategies alone are volatile and exhausting. Principles and philosophy guide strategy and lower volatility. My calendar demonstrates what's important to me: daily exercise, date night, family dinner, client group calls, and calls only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This creates space for creativity and flow. You don't earn the right to free space; you choose it. Intentional time management dictates results. The Sovereign way is about leverage and serving the maximum number of people. ## The Sovereign Consultant: Building a Brand **Summary:** James Kemp outlines a three-step process for building a strong brand: defining and selling a unique mechanism, crafting an aspirational identity, and building a world around your brand. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** A brand is what people say about you when you're not there. The ideal brand does all the selling. Three components: world, identity, and mechanisms. Start with the mechanism – the way you get results. It needs to be unique (yours) and work. Examples: Daily Client Machine (lead magnet with a self-liquidating offer), Customers to Clients (low-ticket workshops with an offer), Hybrid Offer (selling via documents). Next, craft an aspirational identity. What does someone become when they commit to your world? JK's "Cash Creators" is a great example. Finally, world-building. People buy who you are more than what you do. World-building is an abstraction of your reality. Components: characters, language, places, storylines, memes.
