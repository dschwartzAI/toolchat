## Complete Framework

The promise is short-term, the vision is long-term. ## Being True to Your Fans and Embracing Discernment **Summary:** James Kemp advises against being wishy-washy and trying to please everyone, emphasizing the importance of a tight plan that allows people to easily say yes or no. He also discusses the concept of true fans and their unwavering loyalty. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Where I've been straying is not being true to the true fans. The tighter your plan, the easier it is for people to say yes or no. Most people build their business to please everyone. They're constantly thinking, "What does the market want?" Most people don't know what they want. We are articulating ideals and demonstrating. It's the handholds. "This is interesting, or this is relevant." The reticular activating system, the yellow car thing. Sack yourself. Create raving fans. The true fans are the true fans. a footy team, you don't change teams. Offers and content are invitations to pay attention. The best offers are binary. Easy yes or no. The best content is binary. Popular people have detractors because they're individualistic. You can't scale things you don't care about. The coaching industry talks about scaling volume, not scaling care. ## Distributing Your Plan and Building Trust Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp recommends sharing your plan across all platforms, regardless of whether it's a personal or business profile. He also discusses building trust and relationships through content, emphasizing total attention time and the number of insights consumed. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** Should I share my plan from a personal Facebook profile or a business page? As long as you're in it, it doesn't matter. Put your plan everywhere. People can refer back to it. Is there a best content format for building trust? It's hitting the four points and letting them consume. Total attention time. People binge my content before calls. They need to consume a certain amount to get enough insight. A 20-minute YouTube video might have 7,000 words, which is about 30 emails. Both convert, but total consumption time varies. With video, you move people faster because they consume at a higher rate. We're chasing a certain number of insights. 10 insights could come from 10 Facebook posts or one YouTube video. ## Identifying Barriers to Buying and Removing Them Through Content **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of identifying barriers to buying and using content to remove those barriers. He emphasizes the value of offer creation and how it can accelerate client acquisition and retention. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** When people buy, what conditions have they met? There are natural barriers to buying. I focus on offer creation. If I help people create an offer before they become clients, I can quickly tweak it to increase their earnings. They've already done the groundwork. They think I'm a genius, but they did the work. I know what moves the needle. Getting an offer beforehand makes them more likely to become and stay a client. We've already created momentum. What do they need to get results? What do you need to give them so they see they can get the result, but are better off with you? If your content proves they're looking at a barrier the wrong way, that's insight. If it shows they have what they need but don't know how to use it, that's insight. Insight removes barriers. ## Simplifying Offers and Embracing a Scarcity Mindset **Summary:** James Kemp advocates for small, easy-to-digest offers with fewer barriers. He criticizes the scarcity mindset of withholding help and suggests aiming to help people, which naturally leads to client acquisition. Video Source:* 1000 true fans.txt **Content:** I talk about small promises
