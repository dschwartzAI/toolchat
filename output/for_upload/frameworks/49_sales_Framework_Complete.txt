# sales Framework - Complete Guide

# sales Framework

## Overview

** This chunk outlines the eight key steps to building a sovereign consultancy, from committing to your time to automating lead flow and stacking recurring revenue.

## Complete Framework

The Hybrid Offer™
Warning: This offer is not complex but there are multiple variables that require your discernment when executing. Use the parts that apply to you now, revisit as you make progress. Guidance at the end.
Introduction
The problem with traditional offers...
Sell into front end then need to re-sell into back end ● Multi step sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
How Hybrid overcomes these...
Get's an easy 'yes' then adds economics meaning higher conversions ● Sell once, serve for duration ● Get's more PIF (if desired) ● Higher LTV
There's 3 ways to increase revenue - get more clients, get clients to pay more, get clients to stay for longer - The Hybrid Offer does all 3.
The System We Use - The Sovereign System
The Phases
To generate a client we can break it into phases: Lead = Someone we've earned the right to communicate with Customer = Someone who has transacted with us Client = Someone we commit time/resources to
To obtain a client efficiently we must demonstrate competence at each stage. People can skip any of these steps. Eg a lead can quickly become a client, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
For a client to ascend and identify themselves we must understand intent and desire.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction.
IE Get someone to give you money.
For someone to give you money you must gain their attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.

Zoomed out, this is what The Sovereign System looks like:
[The document shows a diagram of "The Sovereign System™" with various components including Services, Event, Consulting, 1:1 Coaching, Community sections, and shows "Offers" leading to different products and services, with Strategy, Daily Client Machine™, Hybrid Client™, and Customers to Clients™ at the bottom]
It is offer driven.
This is the model I use myself.
I aim to do as little 'selling' and 'marketing' as possible.
Working backwards, I want to create highly valuable long term relationships, to find those I create clients and help them generate value, to find clients I generate customers to understand their intent, to find customers and demonstrate my ideas to earn attention and trust.
Approaching EVERYTHING as an offer whether it's free or paid helps construct the most efficient ecosystem possible.
Clients are not created equal.
Power Laws apply.
[The document shows "The Power Ladder™" diagram with pyramids showing progression from 70% at base to 1% at top, with different offer types and price points ($100-$100k+) at each level]
There are people in your audience, leads, customer and client's bases that will happily pay you 50x what others will.
You just need the right offer to enable them to do so.
The Hybrid Offer
Traditional coaching and consulting sells one or more products at specific price points for specific durations.
While it is 'simple', it is closer to easy than simple.
This is why the majority use it, it's easier to leave money on the table than work out how to take it off in a simple manner.
The Hybrid addresses this by selling across the range of prices and times with a single offer.
Simplicity is having ONE OFFER.

There is a useful distinction between offers and products that is rarely made.
Hybrid is a single offer with multiple products inside it.
We must accept two realities:
1. Lower priced products sell at higher volumes than higher priced products. 2. Short term programs sell at higher volumes than long term programs
With these realities, we are searching for the holy grail of an offer that has a low price point, a perceived short term commitment and high price points with long term duration.
By maximising the timeline duration AND the available price points we maximise Lifetime Value (LTV) while allowing the largest number of people to join.
Here's the continuation of the text conversion from the additional images:
Stacking Your Client Offers
The Stack
Before we can create great products we must be clear on what we do for others and how.
Modalities and Strategy Matching
Fixation on the identity of these labels distorts my value creation.
Seeing them as simple modalities allows creativity to match the principles.
The principles can be present in all these modalities.
Coaching - Helping people discover the answer inside them.
Consulting - Giving someone the answer.
Mentorship - Showing someone how I would do it
Creator - Conjuring of original ideas
Curator - Assembly of the best ideas
What I put into practice:
I create for my community, I coach on the weekly calls, I consult on Slack and I mentor on Zoom. I curate and demonstrate these actions to pull more people towards me who might benefit from these actions.
You can sell each modality individually or bundle them up together into products.

. James Kemp: and it's optimal to have a growth offer that a client can continue with at the conclusion. But it's not essential if you just want clients. Now, when you want to get started and and you want to get rolling anything. Making the offer is the most important thing. James Kemp: the James Kemp: one mindset that is very useful to inhabit in the world of help. Whether you're a consultant, a mentor, a coach, or a service provider. James Kemp: is that the offer and the promise you're about to make already exist in the marketplace. In some form, right? James Kemp: Desire is everywhere. James Kemp: People want things that they don't have right now all over the shop. James Kemp: Right? Problems are everywhere. James Kemp: People want stuff to go away and be solved for all over the place, and more desire, and more problems are created than solutions. every single day. James Kemp: so opportunity is bottomless, and the central key to speed of conversion James Kemp: is turning existing desire into immediate demand. James Kemp: If you watch the the call that I had with Lana earlier in the week, we talk about what's already present in the marketplace. James Kemp: What's already? What's already happening? What do people want right now and then? We're just looking for something that meets that existing desire, and that demand. James Kemp: and the more pressing the problem. James Kemp: the more acute and immediate. That demand will be James Kemp: right if you turned up. If someone had got their leg chopped off. And you said, Do you want me to stop the bleeding? You don't need to send them a Google Doc and put them on a 45 min call to put them through a sales process to get. Forget them to say yes, please. I'd you to stop the bleeding right and and metaphorically, there are people in your that match. The skill set that you've got out in the marketplace, bleeding or pining for things that they don't currently have. James Kemp: So it sounds so trite and overly simple. James Kemp: We sell things that people want and especially in James Kemp: the coaching and consulting and expert market. James Kemp: Most people have a really difficult time of getting out of the way of the of ideals, and you hear this in language . James Kemp: they need to have this, and they should have this, and they must want this, which are projections out into a marketplace James Kemp: of James Kemp: knowledge that you possess, that the market doesn't yet possess. Oh, you need you. You should have a Crm. And you're dude. I've got 5 clients, I can, name them, and I know their birthdays. But, to a Crm expert you need a Crm, because that's just what happens. That's what you need to organize things. They don't. They need something right now, and offers that offers that work meet that James Kemp: meet that market right there. James Kemp: The 2 central killers of offers that people don't want the thing that you're selling. James Kemp: Coaches are notorious for making things for themselves, and then thinking that everybody else should want it. James Kemp: And it's not clear what outcome they get. James Kemp: So we simply solve for this. And this is a requirement of much as a surrender requirement rather than a force requirement. We solve for this by having a hypothesis developed from real world data or experience. And that is, people are already buying this off someone else. That is a positive market signal they've asked. They've asked you for it before. That is a positive market signal

Yesterday Andrew asked:
"I don't have any customers yet, let alone clients. I'm literally just starting my consulting journey and don't plan to launch until Feb next year. Is the content you're offering of value to me at such an early stage? I could be wrong but It feels like content your offering is for businesses further down the path."
My answer?
"It’s the fundamentals. Everyone needs those no matter the stage.
Start with the Offer Code in the bundle and you’ll have a better grounding than 98% of consultants."
In over a decade of consulting I have seen very, very few businesses consistently apply the fundamentals.
Every time I consult to a large business it's usually re-installing the fundamentals they lost through complexity, expansion and sabotage through boredom.
The fundamentals of a great offer.
A natural sales process.
And magnetic marketing.
Whether you're just getting started or making millions, I'm willing to bet there's a gap in the flow.
It's showing up in one of the three phases:
Not enough Sales Conversion.
Not Enough Lead Conversion.
Not enough Lead Flow.
Sales conversion is solved with the Offer Code.
Lead Conversion with Customers to Clients.
Lead flow with the Daily Client Machine.
All in the ultimate Black Friday Bundle.

Ad Copy:
This Gdoc Generated $802,000 in Sales without a call...
Back in 2020 a little global emergency meant I had to stop sales calls.
For 7 years I had exclusively sold my services and consulting on the phone.
It was grind but it worked.
In 2020, I was forced to get on a plane and hunker down in the country of my birth for a little bit.
With 2 young kids shut in a tiny house, sales calls weren't happening.
I wrote an offer up on a GDoc and sent it via email and chat.
It took a few iterations but eventually I nailed it.
After selling 100 units via FB messenger and email, I automated the whole sales process and all told this document generated $802,000 in sales.
I've used these principles over and over since and haven't done a sales call in 3 years while selling millions in consulting and services.
The template I'm giving you for free is part of a paid training I have called The Offer Code.
You know how this works:
If I show you the good stuff and how it works, you might want to become a client or purchase one of my trainings.
Or you can just grab my free stuff and win either way.
The Offer Code breaks down how to sell coaching, consulting and services at any price point without getting on the phone.
The principles are based off something I call The Offer Diamond.

If your offer has them, it sells.
The five principles in the Diamond are:
1: Promise 2: Guarantee 3: Scarcity 4: Bonuses 5: Payments
Each principle feeds into the other cumulating in a high converting offer.
It's easier to show demonstrate with an

. James Kemp: You're very, very clear about what you deliver. So it's very scalable, and scalability is in delivery, not in the sales and marketing. James Kemp: And does your offer have a promise to plan and a price with a clear Roi! James Kemp: So skipping ahead, of course, you've just all written a Google Doc offer in the last 37 min. James Kemp: and now you have a first draft of an offer inside there. James Kemp: So your goal should I correct the grammar as I go along? Or is that word. Your goal is to get that offer in front of 10 people and validate it with 3 sales. James Kemp: So during this time you'll be listening intently to feedback from prospects. The validation phase is about learning that outcome that we want in terms of validation of sales. James Kemp: but the learning is where people say no when they have objections where they have questions, and for to update the offer. James Kemp: because it's dynamic again. every time I open the syndicate there's probably one or 2 small tweaks James Kemp: that offer. So even though I've sold it hundreds of times in different iterations. James Kemp: I'm always tweaking the offer to get more clarity into it right so to validate. Audit your audience assets. James Kemp: I do not want to hear that people don't have an audience. James Kemp: Everybody has an audience. They just have different names for it. James Kemp: You have a network, you have a reputation. James Kemp: you have things you have people that you can talk to. that you can validate. So. James Kemp: clients, you haven't closed in the past once to 2 months. Former clients. James Kemp: an email database. So do social media messages, your current advertising partners and networks. James Kemp: 10 people. That's all we want to validate something. James Kemp: If you can think of the first 2 people that you put, a community and consulting offer in front. James Kemp: You're you're a couple of, about 5 min of thinking away from getting to the 10. James Kemp: Everybody has people that they can put office in front of. James Kemp: In a simple way. James Kemp: We send them a simple message. James Kemp: I'm opening the doors for 5 people to work with me to get the promise in James Kemp: the time it takes. James Kemp: I've made it easy to get started for $100 a week. Shall I send you the details? So we use the pricing as a hook. James Kemp: and we start a conversation because the conversation is where it gets the insights. James Kemp: so create a conversation around. The offer is the promise meaningful to them. James Kemp: Getting a no is as good as a yes. because if you get a know with the reasons why. James Kemp: then you get insight into the offer. James Kemp:, this time of year. The no could be a timing. No. James Kemp: no, this is not right now, so it it gets to a next step. James Kemp: No's are just as useful and yes, as in a sales process. because it uncovers the next step. We don't accept maybes because maybes don't lead you to a next step, they just leave you in limbo. James Kemp: So get people to a no James Kemp: right? Is it a timing thing? Is the price thing? Is it a is it a promise thing? Is it a clear? Is it a clear piece. James Kemp: a clarity thing? What makes fun? What questions do they ask James Kemp: again? Clear is kind, clear, is kind to yourself and Clear is kind in office

Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** "Selling from a Google Doc" involves presenting the offer within the document and then providing a simple call to action, inviting prospects to join the community or asking if they have any questions. This straightforward approach can be highly effective. ## Q&A: Annual Pricing vs. Weekly Flexibility and Client Churn **Summary:** This Q&A exchange discusses the benefits of weekly pricing for flexibility and reducing client churn, allowing clients to choose their own adventure and easily adjust their commitment level. Video Source:* Sovereign Consultant.txt **Content:** Weekly pricing offers flexibility, allowing clients to adjust their commitment level and choose their own adventure. This can reduce churn, as clients can downgrade to a lower tier rather than leaving entirely. This flexibility also benefits the consultant, allowing for easier management of client fit and suitability. ## Q&A: Weekly Pricing Psychology and Ease of Entry **Summary:** This Q&A exchange explores the psychology behind weekly pricing, suggesting it makes longer-term commitments feel less daunting and easier to get started with.

> "Yeah, have access to all my trainings on a recurring basis,"
 and with nothing else there. What will that do? I don't know. Will it create a whole cohort of buyers? Yes, it will. What will those buyers do? We will see. What behaviors do they undertake? Do people buy my trainings, and then do a portion of those people then buy one-on-one hours over the top, so they skip out the group components? Possibly. Maybe that's happening at the moment where people are bundling together on their own by buying access to some of my content, but also buying one-on-one hours with me, and skipping over the group component that we have in the Syndicate. For them, that value equation is the most efficient at the relative price point. ## Unbundling for Client Empowerment and Flexibility **Summary:** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages. He emphasizes the importance of offering scalable products and being open to how clients choose to combine them, recognizing that different combinations will appeal to different individuals. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** Unbundling allows our audience and our clients and our customers to access the value that they see fit, and as long as we are prepared to do it and prepared to offer it because it's scalable to us, then they can assemble that for us with low complexity. I don't have a preference for what 90% of people buy off me until I do have a preference in terms of, I can help advise them what's the best path to go in. So that means that by unbundling, I allow people to choose their own adventure and assemble things that I can't see. A training plus a one-on-one component would be highly valuable to one person, but highly risky for someone else because they wouldn't be able to extract the value fast enough relative to where they are. So it comes back to us being able to unbundle, and our clients being able to see the value equation and tip it in their favor. ## Addressing Client Objections and Diagnosing Value Equations **Summary:** James discusses how to handle client objections related to price by diagnosing their individual value equations. He emphasizes asking clients what they're trying to achieve rather than directly addressing their price concerns, as this provides valuable context for understanding their needs. Video Source:* Bundling and unbundling.txt **Content:** As with any sales conversation, you're diagnosing their own value equation. So what do they say? What do they perceive value in? I've purposely avoided upselling and downselling because it's part of a sales process, whereas this is part of a productization process. What you're looking for is them to put the truth on the table as to where they perceive value. And then you've got the option to present how you would deliver against that value. I'll give you two real examples. When I launched the Circle, I said to two people, "You don't need it." One person said, 
> "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it."

## How to Apply

sales process needed to sell into long commitments ● PIF presented first and raises bar to conversions ● Leaves money on the table for those who want 'more'
