# No Framework - Complete Guide & our Framework - Complete Guide

# No Framework

## Overview

No systems on earth that waste 97% of their output have stood the test of time.

## Complete Framework

The Daily Client Machine 2.0
How To Generate Leads, Customers and Clients Fast
Setting The Scene: Efficient Market Dynamics
Client serving businesses are set up to… serve clients. Yet the majority of the marketplace will not become a client. Over a long enough time period, clients come out of an audience in sufficient numbers. But efficiency is finding ways to shorten time periods.
Long sales cycles suck and are hard to scale.
Therefore, we must have efficient ways to identify who is most likely to become a client as early as possible.
Plus, it’s useful to generate cashflow from those who will never become clients in efficient ways.
Traditional Lead Generation
Traditional lead generation and acquisition is a game of large numbers.
Feed 1,000 people in the top.

“Nurture” them while each one slowly drops off.
Get 30 clients out the other end—if you’re good and lucky.
There are numerous issues with this approach. It works when the cost of generating a lead is low enough to waste 97% of the product of a system.
No systems on earth that waste 97% of their output have stood the test of time.
This approach only caters to one type of buying path.
The search for “the best” funnel is an endless one when the constraints are pre-determined.

Dual Mode Client Generation
The 2.0 approach deals with reality:
What we really want is clients, not buckets of leads.
We can use those who won’t immediately (or ever) become clients to fund our marketing
to get clients.
We can monetize IP we have already built.
We can shorten the sales cycle and only engage with the highest quality and readiness
prospects.
Dual Mode means we generate Leads and Customers at the same time using the same ideas.
We make information about our system freely available to consume, then funnel the attention into action.
The fastest way to understand intent and desire is to initiate a transaction (i.e., get someone to give you money).
To get money, you must gain attention and trust by demonstrating you have something they desire.
The Two Buying Types
We need people to consume our ideas (and us) to buy into them.
The key word is consume.
One path a buyer can take:
Consumes information
Derives insight on how it could work for them
Takes the next step and puts the insight into action
The other:

## How to Apply

only caters to one type of buying path.
The search for “the best” funnel is an endless one when the constraints are pre-determined.
