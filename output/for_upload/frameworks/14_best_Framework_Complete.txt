# best Framework

## Overview

It was Sam Ovens was the best at helping people get started.

## Complete Framework

. I'll just come up with a new tactic. And that is good for the good people and terrible for the terrible people because you, you can't, you can't innovate. You can't innovate and outrun it fast enough 'cause the economics don't make sense. 'cause the tension has just got so expensive. Yep. Yeah. I think this is a huge lesson for everyone on this call. No matter your niche, no matter your offer. What I've observed in our pocket, in the market that I'm seeing playing out everywhere is the era of better is over. And the era of different is here. When we got started a few years ago, there were king kings and queens of the hill. It was undisputed. It was Sam Ovens was the best at helping people get started. And for a lot of people, he was the best at helping get people get to a hundred KA month. And it was hilarious., who, who here has ever created a $5,800 offer, right, James? Okay. So there's a, there's a, there's a handful of people here. The reason I ask that is because that was what Sam priced up level, and that was the price point he told everyone to price at, to get to a hundred KA month. And so when I first started in, in my coaching journey in 2020, with my own official program, the number one most common thing I saw over the next 18 months was everyone charged $5,800. In other words, there was a, there was a, a perceived best system, a best way of doing it. It was you ran ads to A VSL, you had a closer, you, you were optimizing for these really specific KPIs. And then you sold a $5,800 offer that was broken into six weeks with lifetime access and a call a week. It was this undisputed, for a lot of people, that was the only way, what we're seeing now, what I'm feeling more than ever is people really focusing on the values and vibes of the people they work with., I caught two minutes of Sam Oven's school video update the other day where they were talking about, everything happening in school. And I found this so funny. They said, yeah, we've changed the way that school games runs 'cause we were attracting way too many hustle bros. And I was, that's so funny that they're talking about that as a software company not going, oh, these guys were, doing something bad. It was, oh, they're not the people for us. And I was, A software company is saying that, that they're, yeah, of all the people that we would want to attract into curator community, we are not looking for the hustle bros. The probably the underlying theme is, they can go over to Wop or GHL, but what we're trying to cultivate here is different. And the encouragement for everyone on this call is this idea that the idea of best and better do not exist. This idea of an objective king, queen category, winner, it doesn't exist in our market. And so the more we try and play that game, the more we are guaranteed to lose. And every one of our markets, there's someone who makes more than us, been in the game longer, has more accolades, more client success stories. And the more you try to play that game, you will always find someone who's willing to outwork you out, sacrifice you let, has, has less morals than you, has less integrity than you when you commit to the different game. Oh, I'm no longer trying to be better than James. I'm trying to be damn Bolton all of a sudden abundance. I'm no longer trying to run an ad that's better than someone else's
