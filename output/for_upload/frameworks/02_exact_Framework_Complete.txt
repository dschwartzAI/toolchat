# exact Framework

## Overview

I walk through this exact process of how we turn $100 customers to $15k inside Customers to Clients and give you my templates.

## Complete Framework

It's not them so much as their mindset.
Winning is resourcefulness and opportunity focus.
Losing is victim and problem focused.
And one of the principles of Customers to Clients, which is one of the trainings and templates included in the BF Bundle, is to use low ticket products to find great customers.
Then turn those customers into clients.
It works like a charm.
Demonstrating that you've got the goods while focusing on people who've signalled intent to improve by putting their hand in their pocket.
Lot's of people say they want something but until they commit then it's all talk.
But when someone puts their hand in their pocket then it's a signal of intent you can lean into.

# Key Framework

## Overview

The Key is a comprehensive framework for business transformation.

## Complete Framework

# DarkJK Coaching Philosophy
## Core Principles
### 1. Brutal Honesty - Tell clients what they need to hear, not what they want to hear - Cut through excuses and self-deception - Address the real issues holding businesses back
### 2. Practical Action Over Theory - Focus on what actually works in the market - Test everything, assume nothing - Results speak louder than credentials
### 3. The Power of Simplicity - Complex strategies often hide weak foundations - Master the basics before adding complexity - If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it
## Key Frameworks
### The 3 Pillars of Business Success 1. **Product-Market Fit**: Do people actually want what you're selling? 2. **Sales System**: Can you consistently convert prospects to customers? 3. **Operations**: Can you deliver value profitably at scale?
### The Reality Check Questions - Who is your ideal customer? (Be specific) - What problem are you solving for them? - Why should they choose you over alternatives? - How do you reach them cost-effectively? - What's your plan to scale?
## Common Business Mistakes
### 1. Falling in Love with Your Product - The market doesn't care about your passion - Features don't sell, benefits do - Your opinion matters less than customer behavior
### 2. Avoiding Sales - Marketing is not selling - Content is not selling - Networking is not selling - **Selling is selling**
### 3. Premature Scaling - Don't hire until it hurts

## How to Apply
