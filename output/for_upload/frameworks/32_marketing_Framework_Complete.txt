James Kemp: but it can have it can be bundled with a lot of benefits that are incidental that are only discovered when we get into motion. James Kemp: What value James Kemp: to come to the calls Jonathan signed up to the install offer a few weeks ago. He's been on my every single syndicate call. He didn't go. I'm joining that because I've I can join the syndicate and those things James Kemp: he's received the benefits from that, and he's experiencing them, etc. And he's making up his own mind about what it's to be in here. Right? James Kemp: So then, if we just focus on being really specific on the install offer. James Kemp: and we include the other pieces as an experience, then it will just it will unfold. James Kemp: Does that make sense Caroline Carpenter: It does so focus on the result. Let them enjoy what they're gonna enjoy and James Kemp: If you get very attached to, I'm going to sell them on this, and then I'm going to keep them forever. And oh, my God, I'm gonna make so much money it will do neither Caroline Carpenter: Okay. James Kemp: It will, but it James Kemp: it won't deliver the the full spectrum of benefits to both parties, that is, that is available Caroline Carpenter: Okay. Caroline Carpenter: okay. Now, I'm having the conflict of, is it cool that I put my stake in the ground on? Here's what I'm gonna do, and some women are coming with me. But I think that's okay, because I'm not twisting anyone's arm or James Kemp: It's fine. It's I. I enjoy being focused. I enjoy. When someone's James Kemp: I give someone a Google Doc James Kemp: and they go out and they go fucking. James Kemp: Someone bought this is a mind bending experience that I didn't talk to this person. James Kemp: and they sent me a hundred $50, or or those things James Kemp: And when you give someone the experience that's transformation James Kemp: because you don't shift beliefs, the experience does everything you need to then go. James Kemp: Maybe I can do it this way. Maybe it's possible James Kemp: it it introduces some level of faith. James Kemp: Hey, Lana. Lana North: Hello! How are you going James Kemp: Good. Lana North: Good been bubbling away since we spoke about this the other day, and I really think that I've been working on the the change communication recovery accelerator for people. So what I do for context for people is help. Professional leaders who are running change programs to master their communication team engagement so they can deliver the benefits. What? I am Lana North: wondering the the pain point that I'm agitating around is so for a program director who has to go and report to their steering committee, and things are starting to stall or slow down or turn from green to red. That's the pain point that I think is very real for them. What I'm more wondering about is on the Lana North: any recommendations that you have around the Lana North: sales or marketing process before that Lana North: to get people to put up their hand? Because I'm just starting out. I don't have, I have my Linkedin audience, which is 1,100 people. But I don't have a my email list or things that

. That's the pain point that I think is very real for them. What I'm more wondering about is on the Lana North: any recommendations that you have around the Lana North: sales or marketing process before that Lana North: to get people to put up their hand? Because I'm just starting out. I don't have, I have my Linkedin audience, which is 1,100 people. But I don't have a my email list or things that. What would you recommend to get people to put up their hand so that then I can start to have the conversation James Kemp: Yeah. So the the language you just used there was. James Kemp: They're going to the steering committee, and and the project's about to turn from green to red. James Kemp: So there's lots of different ways to message that you could tell a story of projects you've been involved in, that., we're going from green to red, and what happened. James Kemp: and no one likes being chewed out in the in the meeting and etc, etc. And this is the 3rd project that's gone this way. That's, over time and over budget and and all the rest. So there's stories. But the the old pointing finger never fails, which is when you can point to James Kemp: an uncomfortable experience that someone's just had or is about to have. Then you'll have their attention Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: Because they will be attempting not to repeat that, or they will be attempting to avoid that in the future. Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: So all the content that you create is, if your project's about to turn from green to red. James Kemp: we can have a conversation. I can show you how to how to get that back on track in 4 weeks. Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: Because that's an objective measure that is James Kemp: the the most objective measure that you probably have, that there may be others. James Kemp: But that's an objective measure of the experience Lana North: Yeah, I thought in terms of, when we talk about our goal is this is going from orange, orange, or red back to green or staying staying green when it when you're on the cusp of tipping over James Kemp: Yeah. Yeah. And then, over time, you could say, my clients only have green projects. James Kemp:, in terms of communication. And those things that James Kemp: the no more Reds crew is is us. But James Kemp: it's the objective experience that come that that someone has. And we talked about, on the call Lana North: Hmm. James Kemp: The optics inside corporate matter, more than anything. James Kemp: How is the project perceived? To be going is the most important thing. It's much more important than how it's going. But how? What? What picture can you paint for the people that matter which is the people above? You? James Kemp: thing Lana North: Yeah. James Kemp: So the the more you can paint a picture of positivity. James Kemp: the in terms of the objective measure, which is, a green project versus a red one. James Kemp: The more engaged they'll be with that Lana North: Yeah, yeah, okay, that'll that'll make sense. So Lana North: in in terms of moving to a bit more of a tactical point of view, it's still doing the same posting outreach to network, and all of that thing. So anything anything else that works really well that Lana North: I should be considering to open the doors or shine the light on James Kemp: With an install offer. The outreach can be pre assumed, which is. James Kemp: hey? I've got. I've got I've got space to get one project back on track. Thanks, Rennie. I've got pro

## Complete Framework

- ```txt ## The Power of One: Building a $1M/Year Business with a Single Offer **Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the simplicity of building a million-dollar online business using a single, well-crafted offer within the knowledge economy. He outlines the path, highlighting the importance of a tight, specific, and minimal offer-driven model. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The path is simple, though not easy: make a promise, define a process with unique mechanisms, create a plan, present the offer, and validate it with sales. This model allows for dynamic, fast iteration using tools Google Docs. Results happen in the marketplace, not from consuming ideas, so creating and testing offers is key. Validation means getting the offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. ## Fast and Stable Growth: Balancing Constraints and Flexibility **Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of stability for rapid growth, advocating for a balance between constraints and flexibility. He emphasizes the need for underlying principles and frames to navigate uncertainty and ensure results happen *for* you, not *to* you. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** The most powerful systems are both fast and stable. To move fast, you need a mix of constraints and flexibility. While certainty is unattainable, having the right frameworks and principles allows you to capitalize on opportunities and solve underlying problems. The initial setup involves defining who you are, what you do, and your target audience. ## Market Selection and Sociological Branding: Prioritizing Your Energy **Summary:** Kemp explains the importance of market selection, advising to be close to money for greater financial success. He contrasts sociological branding (prioritizing your energy and desires) with psychological branding (catering to market demands). Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Your market choice significantly impacts your financial results. Being close to money—its creation, discovery, keeping, and transfer—increases earning potential. However, market selection should align with your desires, skills, and market permission. A sociological business prioritizes your energy and interests, attracting -minded individuals through natural polarization. This contrasts with psychological businesses that chase market demands, often becoming chameleons. ## Building Your Brand: Mechanism, Identity, and Transparency **Summary:** Kemp highlights the importance of a unique mechanism, a clear identity, targeted content, and transparency in building a compelling brand. He advises actively repelling those who aren't your ideal clients and focusing on total, honest communication. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Key elements for a successful brand include a unique mechanism, a defined client identity, content showcasing your past, present, and future, and clear messaging that repels those you don't serve. Transparency is crucial in a low-trust environment. Total, honest communication trumps polished copywriting; authenticity attracts the right people. ## Client Value and Power Laws: Maximizing Revenue and Retention **Summary:** Kemp introduces the concept of power laws in client relationships, emphasizing that not all clients are equal. He advocates for focusing on annualized client value and creating an ecosystem that allows clients to find their natural spending level. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan.txt **Content:** Power laws dictate that a small percentage of clients contribute a large percentage of income. Ignoring this leads to diminishing returns and burnout. Focus on annualized client value and create an ecosystem with revenue buckets. This allows clients to naturally ascend to higher value tiers based on their needs and desires for access and speed. ## Cash Velocity and Revenue Volatility: Smoothing the Path to Growth **Summary:** Kemp stresses the importance of lowering revenue volatility to reduce emotional stress and improve business performance. He recommends reverse engineering from your financial goals and incorporating one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue. Video Source:* source: 6m Plan
