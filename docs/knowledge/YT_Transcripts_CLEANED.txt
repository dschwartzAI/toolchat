Five Steps To Positioning Your Brand in 2025 (Behind The Scenes)

the world is in chaos Well they'd have

you believe it So when things get

chaotic and when things get kind of

crazy in the news and the marketplace

and everyone's confused about what to do

and then positioning yourself has never

been more important and um on this

morning's call so my circle my inner

circle people who have private access to

me uh get together every Tuesday to jam

on what they're working on etc And this

morning I did something on positioning

So positioning yourself in a market

positioning yourself for now making

yourself relevant making yourself

attractive making yourself safe to

actually buy Um so I spent 20 minutes

taking the guys through exactly how to

position the five steps of doing it how

to think about um the different

components how what to consider what to

discuss etc etc and then we went we

jammed on it I want to share that first

bit with you I think it's super relevant

It's super helpful right now and I hope

you get a ton of value from it Um I want

to do a ditty on

positioning as

um

the it's time shall we say I think for

um in the next in the next while there's

going to be tons of winners and losers

and

the it will come down to not so much

what you're selling as how you're

positioned in the and like who you're

selling to And that

is I like this I like this bit because

the positioning yourself correctly in a

in the

marketplace makes all the stuff you've

already got like better not just better

in terms of its actual you know

functionally better but actually it

makes it more pointy in terms of the um

the stuff you do for people and also the

stuff

you the stuff you say out there So I

like the old you know all the

copyrightiting formulas and AIA and all

that kind of stuff And there was one

that works in copy but it works much

better in positioning which is

positioning in the market And the the

major mistake that people have with

positioning is they they look at their

competitors and trying to position

themselves relatively against what other

people are doing

And this is a

like this is the most common mistake if

you like because when things get

uncertain people look for certainty So

they start looking sideways and they go

a so and so is doing that and they

attribute things that they can see and

they attribute status of the person

who's doing them

to what they should do next Right so

they position themselves

competition rather than position

themselves against the the customer and

the market conditions Okay I can hear

myself back How come I can hear myself

back

ross is putting me through a voice I

think I think I I have a

There's five there's five pieces

right

and

there's verify validate vantage values

and the villain So verify is what people

are seeing now or what they've seen in

the past right and so when there's kind

of chaos out there people get acutely

aware of what where they are and how

prepared they are for it So a ton of

people um who are retired right now and

watching their their um retirement

accounts like dwindle are feeling like

"Oh All the all the investments I

made in these things well you know maybe

they were a mistake." So they they see

things and then the things that they see

we validate their feelings right so when

you verify you're seeing you know if I

do the people that I talk to like rising

costs in ads you're seeing

um uh old

models not

working You're seeing um unreliable

uh

stuff you're seeing

um uh

or experiences

with coaches So that you're seeing all

these things the these things have

happened to them right and this is what

they see And it can either be the

immediate things they're seeing or the

things they've done in the past You

validate how they feel So that makes you

feel you know

uncertain on what moves to make

that like makes you s uncertain on who

to trust

right and then you you present

your vantage point This is what you see

playing out I see

solo one

person

businesses with low

overheads and easy to buy

offers as you know duh duh weathering

the storm are going through

this and then the values are the common

things like this is the where you

introduce the Why like why would I do

that well I'm a father and a husband and

I want my

time and I want my to spend time on my

health and my body and with my

family and so therefore I'm building

this kind of business so I can look

after my family Right this is this is

the reason why I'm doing it These are

all the these are all the logical

reasons why these are the things you're

seeing This is you know this is why you

feel like that with them This is the

vantage point that I come from The best

type of business is a solo um offer

driven business with multiple modalities

deployed You've got one-time offers

You've got ways to acquire clients and

you've got ways to ways to you're just

introducing them to the idea And then

the villain is like you know

complexity

teams hiring

uh

costs

um

gurus selling who are you know selling

the the the old thing and you'll see

some of the stuff in my content I'll be

not calling out specific people but I'll

be you know pointing out that there's

people selling ideas that they know

don't work in the market anymore right

and so when you go through this um when

you go through this exercise with your

content and the positioning then you go

through a you go through a journey of

taking someone through that you're

displaying empathy that you understand

what they're seeing you're acknowledging

their feelings So you're being

empathetic about that that that they are

scared confused um angry um that these

are the things they hate These are

enemies And of course um if you are

hyper like political you would you would

position the enemy as a particular

individual or a person Like you need to

do these things so you can get over that

over the man right you know and you

could name the man if if if you had them

And then the the the vantage point is

that this is what I see So this is the

this is the bit where you're introducing

like this is the way forward and this is

the way that you need to go in times of

high

chaos You need to be the most certain

person in the marketplace Right you need

to present even if you don't possess it

100% confidence that the the methods the

philosophy that the strategy that you're

um that you're presenting right now is

the best thing for that person right and

there's no room for may the more chaotic

the overall environment in the

marketplace the more uncertainty that's

spinning around and there's just high

levels of uncertainty spinning

everywhere and there has been for quite

some time Then the more certain you need

to be about this is the way and the more

you need to dismiss the other may and

the potentials right so high chaos is um

is counterbalanced by high certainty And

if you look at the you know the talking

head marketplace or the marketplace of

ideas or the social marketplace the

people who are sometimes

incomprehensibly confident about exactly

what's going to happen are the ones that

get followed along right the people who

are like this is happening to the

economy and this is why tariffs are this

and this is like people are listening to

them because they have that certainty of

you know outcome right and so if we are

leading people and selling them we need

to have that level of certainty that um

almost irrational confidence that this

is the way It needs to be underpinned by

true belief and confidence But you know

you you need to hold that that um that

uh that certain future as as the the the

values piece is obviously people want to

understand who you are

and the that's the most I think that's

the most imperceptible shift in the

marketplace in the last couple of years

that the the how has become commoditized

and the who has been has been a lot

stronger We we are much more subject to

the influence of who is doing something

than than how they're doing it because

the the strategies that many of us do

and teach and implement and those things

are pretty commoditized like everybody

does them or different variations of

them So the who is very important So

you're positioning the values and the

the easiest you know the easiest way to

think about values is the common why You

know what drives you what's important to

you etc And then the like the like or

the aspirational like will attract the

like Um and then the villain And the

villain is a stylistic thing

I personally um don't call people out

right by name or by specifics And I

don't even I don't even go very far when

I'm using villains You know I will use

conceptual villains in in any

positioning I have like bloated bloated

teams and overheads and costs And I will

use the villains as

ideas Different people have different

um and sometimes very effective ways of

deploying this but most everybody who

has um you know something that people

are paying attention to will have some

kind of villain right something that

resonates which is the the us and them

um thing that this raises because all of

these positions just raise you know

contrast that's what they do And so when

when there's a clear um this is us and

this is them this is the villain you

know and we're the good guys then um it

it it has a much stronger kind of

attraction component

So positioning

is fun in my mind because we can take a

lot of stuff that you know already

exists and just run it through the

filter to ensure it's positioned against

something to make it much more

fundamentally strong Everybody has got

something that's fun that's robust and

fundamentally strong when people are put

into it and put through it But the way

that we get more people to see that i.e

the way we get more people to engage

with us the way we get more people to

engage with the ideas and and is

contrasted against something And if you

think about positioning in brand or

positioning in content or positioning in

copy they largely do the same thing

where they're just having a high level

of contrast Um but if you use you know

those frames to you know go what are

people seeing how are they feeling how

do you present the vantage point what

are the values and you know and then

positioning it against the the

alternatives then you're just going to

be that the message will be that much

stronger relative to the noise that's

out there um which is you know ever

present and

it's this isn't none of this is new but

we go through these cycles and I I think

like you know the last major

destabilization of like what the is

going to happen next was probably co and

I think a lot of people are looking at

the world now and being told that

everything's changed and maybe it has

and maybe it hasn't but ultimately um if

we position ourselves adequately then um

you know people will will look at our um

version of the future much more um

coherently Anyone need that notes or

screenshot i'll drop it in

there WhatsApp too

Any questions about that any commentary

How to Get Rich Fast, How to Get Rich Slow

big rain

overnight the pool has way too much

water in

it but uh rainy season is never ending

so you want to get rich

fast well this is how you do it so the

absolute biggest you know opportunity

for a high margin high profit um fast

business these days is selling expertise

honestly it doesn't really matter how um

because you can offer services you can

do stuff for people you can coach people

you can mentor people you can consult on

it um but the absolute fastest way to

get rich is by selling expertise and you

get rich by packaging that up into a

predefined solution that you sell for

between $5 and

$10,000 on a phone call and you do

whatever you possibly can to get people

on the telephone uh and then you make

them an offer and you sell it and here's

two really really dirty secrets about

this it doesn't even have to be good to

make money because if you want to get

rich quick you don't care about the long

term uh if you want to get rich quick

and it's all about the money then you

don't care about delivering results you

don't care about reputation you don't

really care about how happy your clients

are and you don't really care how happy

you are because to get rich really

really fast the biggest secret is that

you have to place um the the um ideal of

getting rich over and above all feelings

the only feeling that you have to cater

for to get rich really fast is how

someone feels about buying off you in

that interim in that beginning point

when you're making the offer and

actually getting someone's money for you

it's unethical it's kind of inhuman um

and it's unsustainable right in all of

those factors and the way to get rich is

through helping other people get what

they want and if you want to get really

really rich really fast then you need to

place your feelings to the side you you

know this is what hustle culture is

hustle culture is the ability to hustle

no matter what no matter how you feel no

matter how low you feel how depressed

you feel no matter um how sad you feel

how tired you feel you've just got to go

and get it done make the sale chase the

person close the deal and you know what

like everybody goes through or goes into

a period of time like that um you know

I'm not embarrassed to say that I've

been in that state many many times of it

doesn't matter how I feel about this i'm

just going to I'm just going to sell it

like I know this isn't the absolute best

thing I can sell at this time you know

and I'm and I'm still working out how to

get results from it but I'm still going

to sell it and I'll work it out and you

know what i did work it out i did work

out how to deliver results to everybody

that I sell to and I did work out how to

um how to ultimately get out of the it

doesn't matter how I feel about it

because nowadays I feel really really

good about what I'm what I do and like

that's how you get rich slowly you get

rich slowly by putting your needs you

know in um equilibrium with the needs of

the people you sell to in equilibrium to

your clients um because when you are

giving and getting and getting and

giving in equal measures then you're in

something that's very

sustainable and the way to get rich

slowly is do something um for a very

very long period of time that

incrementally improves and benefits from

compounding and the way to get rich

slowly is by staying in the game and

that means that you have

to feel good about what you do you know

and lots of people will say "Oh

your feelings." And you know sometimes

that is true if the the goal you know is

over and above your immediate um your

immediate feelings about it if you need

money right now because you need to put

food on the

table I'd argue it doesn't really matter

how you feel about what you need to do

um you know and that's where people dip

into the the unethics and the and fraud

and all these kind of horrible things

but the the way to get rich slowly in

the way is do something for a really

really long period of time and that

means you become rich on all dimensions

you become rich financially you become

rich emotionally because you build um

resilience over long periods of time you

become rich reputationally where people

will come and seek you out where people

will tell other people to seek you out

where people trust you just because of

your word and your name um and that is

how you also stay rich you know and I'm

starting to expand you know the pure

definition of rich because you probably

clicked on this you know thinking about

okay he's going to tell me how to make

money you know and one dimension of

being rich is definitely monetary um

true freedom is downstream of financial

freedom um but also um people are really

really happy for you to get rich if you

do it with them people will resist you

at every turn if you try and get rich

from them and if you try and play zero

sum games with money or status or

reputation then they may seem to work

for a while but they won't work long

term so you know speed at different

times matters and this is why the

discernment of the individual you know

useps everything else i have clients who

you know we make a rational decision to

to push and to hustle we make a rational

decision to it doesn't really matter how

you feel about this the next couple of

weeks are just going to be a grind but

you're going to bring in this much money

and on the other side of this you built

this asset on the other side of this

this is delivered and you've got

something established that then you can

pull back from and sustain and I've got

clients who are right up against the

grindstone nose to the grindstone and

they won't stop because they fear

getting off the money train or they

won't stop because they fear what people

will think and we have to agree to pull

them back and and take a dip you know

take the dip um take the take the going

backwards take the slowing down for a

period of time because we agree it's

unsustainable to do this and if they

don't then their big their risk is to go

to zero and that's the way that you you

know get poor and you get kicked out of

the game is when you go to zero when you

can't do it anymore when you can't

sustain it etc etc um which is all to

say discerning on knowing what you

actually truly need at the time um

defines how you solve the problem and

how far you are prepared to push on that

uh on all dimensions you know

energetically and emotionally and

financially and practically um so you

can get rich all the different ways

that's I don't want to say it's never

been easier but it's definitely never

been simpler um it's never been harder

on so many dimensions mainly because

there are so many options on you know

what to do and who to listen to um and

that's you know some people just need to

stop listening to everyone and just

listen to one person and it doesn't

really matter who it is because if they

follow you know someone who's done it

before and walk that path then they

should follow them and ignore everybody

else um but it's never been simpler uh

in terms of the opportunities and it's

never been simpler in terms of the

models

The Fastest Way to $100k/mo Coaching Biz (And why I'm not doing it)

I'm going to tell you what the absolute

fastest way to make profit for the semi-

average slightly above average person in

2025 is and I'm also going to tell you

exactly why I'm not doing it as my Mr

thine would say no cap for real for real

and so to tell you what's the fastest I

need to tell you that I've done it three

times and three times

uh

starting almost a decade ago uh which

was the the the dawn of my first kind of

coaching program/ digital product I had

a digital product which is a coaching

program at the time for e-commerce

businesses that helped e-commerce

businesses scale their online stores and

what I did is I sold that for

$2,500 and then I sold it for $5,000 and

then I sold it for

$6,800 and what I did is I posted

content and I ran Facebook ads just on

Facebook no other platform um I got

people on the telephone on a 30 to 45

minute call and I sold them that program

and then every week I turn up to a call

with them I added them to a Facebook

group and I gave them access to a very

fancy not really Google drive with

documents trainings templates videos Etc

um and I did that and 13 months later I

had made $1.3 million

$1.3 million us at the time um then I

did that again and then I did it again

and the formula to this day works the

formula of having a very high margin

coaching training Consulting product

that shows someone how to get a defined

result over a defined time period that's

sold for5 plus th000 via the

telephone if you want the absolute

fastest way to grow start and grow a

profitable coaching Consulting business

in

2025 the answer has been the same for

about 8 years do that um that is the

fastest way because what you will do is

have the highest margin product and as

long as you f the product to the market

you will have demand for it you know you

as long as you can have a promise that

people um actually want they want to

make money they want a better body a

better relationship a better life

whatever it may be there's only four

categories I've covered them many times

look out the videos make money save

money live a better life or stay at a

jail you got to be selling in one of

those categories the absolute fastest

way to sell that is on the telephone the

absolute fastest way is to get people on

the phone understand their current state

um understand the gap between the

current state and their desired future

State present your program as the

desired future State and and then get

their money and then put them in

something that's high leverage to

deliver you can get to multiple six

figures a month doing that if you spend

every waking hour hustling posting

content to get people on the phone you

get them on the phone and you sell 40%

to 50% of those people into that product

you'll make a ton of money you'll get

some of those people results depending

on your skill level how experienced you

are how good you are the scope of the

promise Etc that's the most variables

that to this day is the absolute fastest

way to do it

um the reason I'm not doing that is that

it's a young man's game and what I

realized after years and years of doing

that the trade-offs that have to happen

in the pursuit of growth and the pursuit

of money are not trade-offs that I'm

prepared to make so nowadays I have

programs with defined promises I have a

mentorship program that has no promises

whatsoever it just allow people to look

over my shoulder and share insights with

them and and give them office hours a

couple of times we where they can ask me

questions it doesn't have a single

promise in the world it's solded via a

Google doc I will not get on a call um I

will only get on a call with people who

actually invest in consulting or I've

invested in them in terms of taking them

as a coaching client and commitment or

they're in The Syndicate and part of the

mentorship and the reason that the call

based system as a as a young man's game

is requires a lot of energy and a lot of

time and at my stage of life I have two

children both of them over there right

now I have two dogs both of them over

there right now I have another child on

the way I have a wonderful relationship

I love to travel I love to do absolutely

nothing for long periods of time I love

to stuff around I'm wearing these

clothes cuz I'm about to go on an

hourong walk and listen to a podcast um

before our Chef arrives and cook and and

Cooks us dinner tonight um I don't want

to be on the telephone all the time I

want to spend time doing those things I

want to spend time with the kids I want

to spend time swing my pool I want to

spend time chasing the dogs on the beach

I want to spend time with my uh soon to

be uh new wife and the the the young

man's game is the fastest way to make

money because you can deploy a lot of

energy into it you can get people on the

phone you can hustle you can grind you

can do all those things and you make a

ton of money and you might want to keep

doing that or you might want to take it

to the next level where you start hiring

people you build a sales team to sell

that you hire coaches to coach the

people you hire Consultants to consult

to the people etc etc um that is the

scalable part and what you will see in

that path is that growth starts to slow

down because your operations get um

larger you spend more money on things

like marketing and advertising um there

you you lose a little bit of contact

with the clients so you not don't have

your finger on the post because you're

not the one selling and you're not the

one Consulting and coaching at the mpce

um so the business starts to slow down

so that time when you're the one on the

phone selling that time when you're the

only one coaching Etc is the fastest

growth period and it's also the hardest

because you have to be everything and

the reason that I choose to go slowly

and don't understand what the situation

I'm in I've been doing this for a long

time I've made a ton of money I have

very strong cash flow I have very strong

recurring Revenue so I can afford to go

slowly but I also choose to go slowly I

choose um the old man's game I choose

the slower smoother path because it has

low stress it allows me to put the

energy into places that that that

actually matter and I lost sight for

many years that the business was there

to feed my life and I had many

trade-offs in the course of you know

when the kids were young and in my

previous marriage Etc where it was

growth at all cost that I would take the

call even if it was the right thing

wasn't the right thing for me and all of

us because I was chasing the sale and I

was chasing the deal even well past the

point where I didn't need to do that I

didn't need the money and I was on that

Relentless

Pursuit and um that was costly it has

been very costly I don't regret a single

bit of it because it got me to where I

am now which is in a wonderful spot um

but in in hindsight there were there

were trade-offs that I that I tolerated

for too long in that model and I'm

saying this because I speak to a ton of

people every day that can't let go of

that because they're just on that

Relentless cycle of trying to beat last

month you know oh we did 200k last month

and if we don't do 250 this month then

you know it's all a disaster and it's um

whatever whatever story they're telling

themselves I've heard them all and I'm

saying this because there is a choice if

you want to go fast I am not your guy um

if you want to go the fastest route

which is getting on calls and you know

closing people and selling to everybody

who remotely resembles the you know your

ideal target market then I'm not your

guy there are there are really good

people out there who do that you know

day in day out um and they run that

model themselves and then they um they

also teach that model themselves some of

them are speaking to me about how much

they hate it but they still teach it so

uh that's just between you and I but the

the fact is that there are trade-offs in

that model it is the fastest um it's got

some serious trade-offs and it's got

some serious downsides that that only

become apparent while doing it but you

know what I'm damn glad I did it the the

1500 odd sales skills I did made me damn

good at selling it made me damn good at

offer creation it may be damnn good at

content and May and they're a very fast

feedback loop so you know the old adage

that you know slow as smooth and smooth

as fast is very much true for me these

days you can have an offer that which

has a defined product promise a defined

you know path and you know it defined

specifics around it with pricing Etc

that you can put in a Google doc a text

document on a relatively pretty landing

page and still make sales with that it

will be slower um and many cases you'll

get better people because they will

spend more time you know considering

your content considering the offer and

considering the promises you're making

or not making in the case of it um so it

is a harder sell but by the time you've

actually sold someone if you're more

patient um then the type of people you

get tend to be more patient as well and

in it for the long haul um so the

absolute fastest way isn't isn't

necessarily the best way and this is

where your discernment on who you're

following what you work with um and what

strategies you use are ultimately down

to your what you want and what you

expect and what you need from your life

um because every single strategy out

there that someone's selling works there

are better people out there to follow

and better people to invest in who have

very much got it dialed in and and are

much better teachers than others and

there are people who you know will sell

you things that actually work in

fundamentals but they don't know how

they work in principles so they don't

actually they're not actually great at

actually presenting it again like

discernment is required um for me at the

stage of life I'm at and the commitments

I have

the the selling from docs making content

sending emails every day making these

videos Etc you know it takes longer to

get results and it takes longer than it

would do if I was on the phone I would

make triple the money that I do um these

days than if if I was actually taking

calls and selling on the phone or if I

decided to build a sales team and those

things you know what if I built a sales

team I'd probably make exactly the same

profit and just have much much higher

our overheads and just a much shorter

sales cycle that's the reality so all to

say there is a fast way um I don't do it

you may choose to do it um but go in and

choose the strategies that you're

thinking about the the the market and

the methods that you're going to use

very carefully and think about the fact

that I believe fundamentally your

business is there to feed your life so

if your business is sucking the life out

of you um then you might want to think

about it um but if your business is

feeding your life you've got the time

the money the energy to do the things

you want then you're definitely on the

right path

Coaches: You Do Not Sell 'Confidence' or 'Clarity'

just got off a workshop and uh getting

ready for boxing apparently I'm getting

better so uh got all the space to do it

so uh had a workshop this morning uh

about 85 people came and it was about

content and as usual you know the usual

folks turn up it's about half kind of

coaches and then half people who do

other stuff and of the coaches you know

about 50% of the people who work with me

I'm going to sit down 50% of the people

work with me sell money like business

coaches right and so business coaches

people go well it's really easy to make

a promise if you're a business coach who

you sell money because it's tangible and

like how do James how do I improve my

offer because it's easy for business

coaches they can just help people make

more money and that is true uh it is

easy to make a clear offer about making

more money like you know I will help you

make $100,000 give me $110,000 like

oversimplification but that kind of

works but there were a lot of people

there who sold um personal development

healing um uh Fitness and these things

which are in their eyes less tangible

and I've had this for years and

ironically some of my most successful

clients over the years don't sell money

they don't sell business coaching they

don't sell strategy um they sold help

they sold personal development they sold

Fitness and the reason they were

successful is I helped them make their

office tangible and one of the things

that um you know and if you're selling

personal development selling Fitness Etc

is that people talk about uh I sell

confidence or I sell Clarity and you

don't you cannot sell those things

because they are outcomes of doing

things right you do not need to have

Clarity on how to become a millionaire

you just need to do the things that are

required to become a millionaire you do

not need to believe and have the

confidence that you can become a

millionaire you just need to do the

things that are required to have it

there is plenty of unconfident

millionaires um but in the course of

like selling personal development lots

of people default to I help people

become more confident I help people with

Clarity and the correlation the

causation is just like really the wrong

way around because people become

Confident by taking action being

consistent with that action I.E not

lying to themselves and their confidence

develops but again like pepper

throughout this I've said the word like

doing an action right so if you're in

the personal development space if you're

selling Fitness or anything like that

Fitness is a little bit easier because

you can be tangible about um you know

muscle gain or fat loss or um you know

specific performance metrics but if

you're in the personal development space

you are not in the business of selling

confidence and Clarity you are in the

business of selling specific actions

that that person has confidence in that

if they do that action that on the other

side they will get more confidence and

more clarity um so like a a tangible

example the other factor of um these

examples is that there needs to be an

incentive for people to do it people

don't just um seek to improve themselves

without an incentive people don't seek

to heal trauma without an incentive um

so someone who came on the workshop

today um they help people with trauma

and um we talked about you know specific

like sexual trauma and one of the things

that um people with those kind of

traumas have is they tend to heal that

trauma when they have an incentive to do

so and the incentive is I'm absolutely

sick to death of living like this and

I've reached the end of my tolerance for

this so therefore I want to live a

better life the other one is they enter

a relationship where the cost of the

trauma they see the direct cost of the

trauma um affecting their relationship

so therefore they seek they have a high

incentive to heal that trauma and so I

said to her two things firstly you need

to talk to the incentive you know if

you're in a relationship you want to

heal your heal your traa like now is the

time so you talk to the the symptoms of

of of these things coming up you know

you talk to the your content talks to

the symptoms of um that your trauma is

getting in the way of your intimacy that

your trauma is pushing your partner away

um and you know here's an example of

someone who did that and they lost their

relationship but here's an example who

of someone who used my XYZ me mechanism

prev and they went from pushing their

partner away because of their trauma to

um to welcome and and then them enjoying

intimacy every day so the tangible

things are okay you need an incentive to

do it but you also need to take tangible

action and this is where mechanisms come

in you are not selling the outcomes you

are selling the mechanisms that people

do so you know um with my terrific

trauma protocol um in in 30 days you'll

heal your trauma so you can have more

confidence more intimacy and more on on

the other side you are never in the

business of selling the things that are

on the other side of something you are

in the business of selling um the the

mechanisms that go into it because that

allows people to see what you actually

sell and what you actually buy what they

are actually buying and allows you to

differentiate in the market for people

who are talking about these you know

things of confidence like you can't

point at those things to say this is a

mechanism it does this in this period of

time you're going to invest in this

mechanism because you have the incentive

to do so because you're in a

relationship or you're sick to death of

the you know the the thing that you're

doing so all offers and all messages can

become tangible if you point out the

things that happen as an outcome a

tangible pointable result um you know

confidence so you can have a better

relationship um or you point at a

tangible mechanism that people actually

have an input through um

because if you keep talking in these

kind of generic woolly terms about oh

yeah people will become more confident

when they work with me and people like

that then you're confusing what people

buy and you're confusing the ultimate

outcomes that you derive because those

outcomes are a bu product of the action

and the work that people ultimately do

so um

selling supposedly intangible things

becomes very simple when you point at

things that they are actually buying you

point at incentives that they have to to

do it right now and you point at um

ultimately the distinct outcomes that

they have and those outcomes you know

monetary outcomes are are easy for

people to Value but um outcomes that are

behavioral or or that show up in

people's lives so you can have more

intimacy every day um you know be become

much more tangible than these kind of um

generic ideas every offer can be made

tangible you know it just requires a

little bit of looking

um and uh and know stepping back from

the mixing up of the of the correlation

and the causation of the work that you

do um I personally help people make

money they do the work and they they get

the outcomes and they get the benefits

and they use that money to do things you

know which is the a lot of the other

stuff I talk about um they do use that

money to live a better life but at the

end of the day you know I point at the

outcomes I point the mechanism and I

point at the things that that people can

actually see and value um and that works

no matter what you sell

What's Working in 2025 To Get High Ticket Clients

I ran my first Facebook ad in uh

2017 so uh I guess I'm a veteran back in

the back in the day when you were own a

Facebook ad you could get a booked call

and sell someone a very expensive um you

know Consulting program uh for about 50

in the time New Zealand dollars so you

could run an ad get someone to a vsl

convince them you know that you knew

what you were talking about understand

what they needed uh prove prove that you

understand what they needed get them on

a call and sell them a $22 to $10,000

you know Consulting program and um

people still do that to this day uh and

it doesn't cost $50 anymore and

everybody I talked to who still runs um

core funnels um and still runs ads to

them um always report costs going up the

only exception in this and you know one

of the biggest Moes that people have

these days is someone with a brand if

you've got a large person brand a large

brand on YouTube or on Instagram or one

of those where people are pre-sold on

you um then you book a core funnels and

these things still really work um most

people don't have a large personal brand

um Everybody's Got a Brand but most

people don't have a large manufactured

you know intentional personal brand and

so in 2025 you are kind of you know

steering into the headwinds of a low

trust environment the fact is that lots

of people have been making lots of big

bold crazy in many cases unrealistic

promises and we are in a low trust

environment and you know back 10 years

ago you know just like your Boomer

parents would believe every sing single

thing on the

news people believed every single thing

they saw on the internet and they bought

the claims they bought the promises and

they bought into everything um and you

know you could pretty much sell anything

these days we are in a very low trust

environment

and that means the the marketing and the

force that people are putting into

marketing to try and convince people of

those things is a it's less effective

because we're in a low trust environment

and B there's just way more people doing

it so the the the signal to noise ratio

has changed

dramatically and so that brings us to

the present day so 24 hours ago I ran a

workshop and on that Workshop ironically

I showed people my workshop process of

how I sell Workshop tickets for $100 and

how I generate you know multiple

thousand High ticket customers off the

back of that and one of the things that

we did in the Q&A so we went for about 2

and a half hours and about half of that

is teaching and about half of that is

just Q&A where I just help people one of

the things I said in that environment is

that we have to give people an

experience the days are are are you know

they're not gone but they're coming to

an end where people will be nurtured

through a multi-step funnel where

they'll see lots and lots of pieces of

content and eventually do something and

eventually book a cool people are far

more cynical and far more skeptical and

they're far more preserv preserving of

their time so it's never cost more to

generate you know get someone to a

webinar and and sell them on the webinar

it's never cost more to get someone to

book a call and so in the in a low trust

environment what do you do um you have

to allow people to prove things to

themselves with their very own eyes and

we do this through experience so

yesterday on that Workshop I sold the

tickets to that workshop for $9 um $9 is

you know a kind of no-brainer price I

sold hundreds and hundreds of tickets

and you know um just over 100 people

turned up at the peak and a lot of

people catching it on the replay today

and and and reaching out to me and what

I did on that Workshop was give people

an experience if because I allow people

on the workshop to ask me a question to

get help from me I'm giving them a small

small taste of what it might be like to

work with me what it might be like to be

able to rent my brain once or twice a

week you know which I allow people to do

in my client programs and through that

experience they can build up their own

judgment by actually having that

experience I could say 50 things to

these people and prove case studies and

prove this and prove that and they would

look at them with skepticism but I can

do more and give more experience in a

60c um conversation or even someone

witnessing a 60-second conversation

um than I can with my giving people

information and showing them all the way

and that's all marketing is really doing

it's you know trying to shift beliefs

through information and showing people

things um and tell and telling them as

well and in 2025 the thing that's going

to work is to give people experience

that is why I'm prepared to do things

like drop my pants if you like um for $9

by selling a workshop ticket so cheap

just to allow people to give that

experience and you know 42 people signed

up to something off the back of that

workshop for something else you know

between 50 and $750 a week um because I

gave them an experience and so if you

are good at what you do this should be

very very exciting because you were

sitting on assets that you can allow

people to experience and you shouldn't

be too worried about what you sell those

assets for as long as you have those

assets leading to another asset I am

quite happy to sell $9 Workshop tickets

because I'll sign the best people up to

join my membership or get be coached by

me or join The Syndicate and you know

get access to me I'd be quite happy to

do that because it leads to something

else and even if someone goes away you

know and they got you know multiple

times what they thought in terms of

value of $9 even if they don't buy

something there's some Goodwill in the

market I've delivered I've overd

delivered you know relative to what they

paid and the time they dedicated

so Marketing in 2025 isn't marketing you

know it's demonstration and its

experience it's giving people the

experience of what it could be like to

do this you know and you could do this

through low ticket products you could do

it through AI tools you could do it

through workshops you can do it through

any kind of experience where someone

interacts with you you know these days

I'd be much more mindful to sell a

Consulting call than I would to book a

free sales call um I think it's far more

targeted and valuable valuable for

someone I think it's far more um

insightful and experiential for someone

and you're far more likely to get a

great you know long-term client out of

that than you are of just you know

trying to convince someone on a 30 to 45

minute call so none of these you know

none of these things are very new um but

the tools that our disposal to do

something about it you know are sitting

right to front of us and so the the

future of marketing isn't marketing it's

giving people the experience it's giving

them a trial it's giving them a taste of

what it might be like to work with you

and if you're in the information

expertise business you have the

advantage of a very very lowc costed

delivery so you can do things and make

them make make sense on an economic

basis that people with physical and hard

Goods you know simply can't do so um

that's where we are in the marketplace

that's what I'm doing about it that's

what a lot of my clients are doing about

it and it's also what's working right

now

Interview with Dan Bolton:

took me 7 months to get my first 100K month which is a huge pain do you think it's easier or harder to get to 100K

month now I think the opportunity is never been better for someone with

skills James Camp the Savant the Jack barley consultant talk to me about kind

of how tone plays into standing out online your online content and your personality they're the same thing right

my online content and my personality they're pretty much the same thing because I know you I can finally see you

as humans we're desperate to connect with people and we're desperate to truly see and not be deceived when you truly just turn up in the way that you want to

turn up as that comes through all these different channels and if you turn up as yourself then you can't be competed with

but I have chickens and you don't that actually makes us different people we're back with another uh highly Topic

demanded treat we have James Camp the Sant the Jack barley consultant um and

uh we're going to be diving into how how do get to 100K a month so whether you're making 5 10 20 50 and you want to get to

that mythical seven figures we're going to talk about how we have done it how we would do it differently and we're going

to break down the offers and the business model we're going to talk about funnels we're going to talk about team and all the mistakes that hopefully

we've made that you can avoid um so welcome back bro it's great to have you here we got some good feedback on our first one and we we've upped the anti of

the production for this one oh just a little bit I know yeah just a little bit um but one of the things I want to talk

about was well I guess the main thing is like getting to seven figures right clickfunnels is indoctrinated as all

right two comic only one funnel away right one funnel away and so what I want to talk about is uh I guess firstly how How we did it

we did it I think it would be helpful to talk about what what did we actually do to get there without going into the full back story if anyone wants the full back

story they can click the link below there'll be like the origin story going from you know selling was it cars was

that the background yeah all of that lots of stuff um so just quick recap

what year did you get into actual online Consulting and then when was your first 100K month so 11 years ago damn dog I

know I know you you were like in your 20s then I was in my nappies so 11 years ago sold my first

like online program yeah and then it took me 7 months to get my first 100K month after I went from like inperson

Consulting to going online okay that's a sexy headline so what were you selling how much was it and how were you getting those clients yeah I had a program

called e-commerce engine so um back then e commer was like pretty damn new and

like cobbling together all the different like how do you optimize your shopping cart how do you optimize the the the

page um how do you do Facebook ads and those kind of things were were pretty pretty complicated and so e-commerce

engine was like was like actually only the beginning of when ads were ads were a thing and like Google was the the main

channel so e-commerce engine was started at 2 and a half Grand so they join you get a group a call and what else just a

it was a Google drive folder with loads of like how-to stuff in it so a course yeah um and then it went to 4 and a half

K and then it went to 60800 I think 65 68 don't remember precisely but it was

like pay once sell on the phone lifetime access yeah lifetime access group grew

and grew and grew ran a call every week y keept selling so you got a course you got course modules you've got uh a

Facebook group and you've got a community call once a week yeah go to webinar account on the the classic Sam ovens model but was just pre

like just Sam Sam was the one like gave me the the seed idea of taking the stuff

on I was going I was doing offline going online yeah but then later on when I worked with him it was like it's too

cheap you need to put the price up right yeah well I think it's important to note same with me I hit my first 100K month First 100k month

not 11 years ago in 7 months it took me uh first iteration of my business was like everything for everyone I was

around 10 to 20K a month for a year relaunched uh the agency went from

everything to everyone to just working with coach and Consultants getting more sales calls with webinars went from Z to

100K month with that a 9 months so you had me beat by two but I think it's important for people to know that we didn't just hit that and then stay there

and everything was nice and dandy way and so can we quickly go on the Peaks and troughs of that because I know that

you've had uh different business model changes it's not like you've been selling the kind of course model and things like that for the years so you go

to 100K a month did you sustain it how long did you st it for what did that

look like yeah so the next iteration was um people basically said How are you selling expensive things on the

telephone I want to learn about how to do that so I had a program called Authority architecture so I took the

same model and lifted it across to a much more you know lead gen B2B I was

just repackaging what I'd used to sell e-commerce engine into a front- end course and that was 6800 and then I sold

on the phone course group calls the difference with that was um the I had I

started to to have a back end so I started to okay you've been around for a while you've hit your goals you're

getting leads coming in I've got a mastermind do you want to join and that was called Authority Elite so I I I then

graduated from the pain of starting every month at zero right which is a

huge pain yeah you know crime a river kind of pain as people at 100 Grand well so just a quick recap so going back to

the price points you had 100K a month I imagine that was like you selling 30 or 40 units of your yeah it was rents and

repeat and repair just keep going around starting with zero recurring Revenue got

to keep going oh you had pay plans but at the prices I was at most people just paid up yeah that's the recurring

Revenue yeah the recurring Revenue lasted for a month yeah yeah yeah totally get it yeah yeah so that then

you know I was started to be sold and indoctrinated on the idea and actually experienced it of getting some element

of recurring Revenue so then I went Authority Elite and that's when I hit my first like um I did

256k I remember exactly because I remember it happening when I was like I'm selling a front end and then I've

got a back end which at 50% of the revenue I coming to rec caring like 2K a month do you think because obviously Cost to acquire a client

we've had so many iterations and Evolutions to the online space like just to give us some perspective for anyone who knows kind of the Facebook ads world

what was it costing you to get a call booked to and then to acquire a client what was that cost so and when I started

e-commerce engine it cost about 100 bucks to get a client disgusting New Zealand Dollars oh my gosh so we're

working pay which is like $4 us time hard question completely subjective do

you think it's easier or harder to get to 100K a month now than it was then I don't just mean cost to acquire customer

I mean all the thing and and I think it's important to qualify even though you were 7 months into yeah uh this

business it wasn't like your first rodeo you bu you built skills there was no way as a noob as a beginner I was doing I

was doing 40 to 50 Grand a month Consulting perfect in person that's 100% what I want there was a skill transfer

yeah so online is a Leverage is a leverage piece not and and I think people often mistake it for the

distribution so I'll answer the question but I think people mistake it for the internet has given us access to more

people but I think it's just given us a bigger power l in terms of the delivery of those things because it showed when I

could do Consulting one to one but the leverage I got from going one to many in a group envirment was ridiculous because

I to get the 50 Grand a month they had to do 20 30 40 hours a week of Consulting right and I could do the same

delivery you know in 3 hours M so I think it's easier

now to grow faster but I think less people are able to do it because the

barriers to entry are much lower right so I think you can I think the opportunity has never been better for

someone with skills to transfer those on online and grow quickly but I think for

most people they don't have the skills that are transferable to achieve um you know a six figure month

you know out of the gate yeah and I think there's there's a really easy way to understand this when I first got Sam Market sophistication

oven uh or really any ads showing up in my news feed let's say 5 years ago or

six years ago before I'd stepped into the space Sam's messaging was not all

the advanced stuff that we know now in terms of unique mechanisms and things like that he was literally like I will

show you how to get clients online and that was such like mindblowing

uh such a mind-blowing claim because no one could make it and so like I could almost recite his his his vsl headline

was how to get 20 to 30 clients a month online with predictability yeah yeah

yeah it was like down to the dollar in the day down to the dollar in the day yeah and so so heavy breakthrough advertising yeah so it talks about the

different levels of Market sophistication so if you invented if you if you figured out how to uh teach

weight loss yeah the claim is I will help you lose weight and then other people come up with that same claim and

so then you go I will help you lose £10 in 30 days and then it goes a level deeper in your added mechanism I will

help you lose 10 to 30 days using anabolic fasting whatever it might be and that's what the market we've been in

has gone through and so why it's harder because the barrier entry is lower is there's so many coaches and Consultants

that can come online and say I can help you get to 10K a month I can help you lose 30 the differentiator is obviously

uh you as the human being right it's you as the NCH it's your messaging and all of those things and that's where the complexity comes to right is it's not

like the uh the way that you get to 100K month has gotten wildly more challenging

because you've got to have 37 offers and run Tik Tok ads and dance on reals and all those things the Simplicity is the

same from my perspective but the difficulty is in the ability to stand out and convert strangers andan

customers if you're playing in the red ocean with everyone else yeah fully and I think Market sophistication as well of

like people think about if you if you look at coaching and cons Consulting we've gone through the early adopter

phase so the people who were the early adopters who were going to be coached and consult they were the easy sales

right and now we're in kind of the mass and we're we're going towards the you know the middle of the of the

curve there are more opportunities because more people of different sophistication levels and businesses are

coming into the market but they are harder to sell because there's more aggregate supply in the market for those

so there's more opportunity but there's also more supply of people who will fulfill that opportunity yeah it's Online education

interesting because when I got started 5 years ago it was really weird when I

talked to like everyday people that I was surrounded by and I said I bought an online course and it's teaching me how

to start a business online it was not even a question of like scam it was like

didn't even registering people's minds that online education was a real thing and now I think with the introduction of

you've got got even even just think about how something like this I can't remember the exact number but you know like bin Shapiro and he's got the daily

wire don't call me on the numbers but it's something like he has like a million subscribers a month and they pay

tens of dollars whatever that might be the idea that you can find your favorite content creator or find their business

Guru or sign up to masterclass.com this is all commonplace now yeah so the average person is being able to access

education or content behind a pay wall like they never have before so like people get it yeah right when you're

paying $5 a month or $97 a month or $1,000 for um content that you can't get anywhere else that's a common uh

experience now whereas 5 years ago that truly wasn't like you had to be an early adopter to get it so there are more

people that like you said have the um have the awareness that this exists

and then on the flip side I mean I don't know what the numbers would be but it's felt like at least the industry is like

10x in terms of if we were through it and I want to

qualify by we're not say this is the way obvious we're passionate about what we teach or it's the only way yeah like you

know we were talking about someone before who just got 3,000 clients 3,000 students paying them $5 a month yeah I

mean that's insane so there's a lot of ways to get to 10K just like there are a lot of ways to get to 100K but if you're

just starting out let's talk about models and offers yeah could I just say something about the speed thing yeah please because the speed is relative to

the position of the the number of steps they need to take to get to get to the outcome goal so for example if you have

the skills then there's one step past that is packaging the skills so other another

person can benefit from those skills then there's the packaging of that and the ability to sell those skills to

people on mass and then those people to act on the skills and then so it's like

Steps but if you're a oneon-one coach or consultant and you're already

working with clients you don't you've you've got you get results but you haven't packaged it correctly there's

only one step which is just packaging it correctly yeah so those people are further down the steps towards the 100K

than the people who had just got the skills or in many cases don't have the skills because they need to get the

skill get get get results with the skill package the skill so there's all those steps so the speed is just relative to

the number of steps they need to take that's why if someone comes to me and goes I've got a Consulting practice and

I'm doing 20 to 40K a month and it's lumpy and it's oneon-one and burnt out I'm like sweet this is pretty

straightforward because it's just a packaging exercise and putting it off around it whereas someone's like I've got all these skills I'm not sure which

one to focus on I get results over here but I don't get you you know that there's some filters to go through

before they're going to take those steps cuz they're five steps away whereas the person who's delivering even one to one or with low Leverage is only really one

step away and that's a packaging step we can look back to this but I want to mention this as well there's a huge difference between someone who's been at Teachability

$10,000 a month for 3 months and $10,000 a month for two years in terms of their teachability as well so actually one of

the biggest challenges 100% so like uh I was I had a client U asking me a few

weeks ago who's like in the kind of multiple seven figures profit level and he got there really fast cuz he had a really decent sized audience and he was

asking me like uh what are the biggest things that you find in terms of taking something from like 10 month to like six

figures s figures and I said well you need to understand that not all six figures are created equal if you are

like I have an amazing client called Grayson who's 20 and he went from 10K a month to uh $87,000 cash in like four

months our first 16 weeks working together it's because everything I told him to do he did yeah he knew what he

didn't know and he was fully teachable and so that's a really interesting variable is that it's skills but it's

also your ability to be teachable and coachable and not overthink things because if you've been in the game for a

while you might not have made a ton of money but you have more confidence than maybe you should in areas where you

shouldn't have confidence this is really this is really um relevant to me because someone who's joined me this week is

making great Revenue making great money and he he was describing himself as a newbie in our convers in our chat

conversation and I'm like I it didn't click straight away but what he was talking about was that he is essentially

saying I'm a newbie because I am I don't know what I don't know right and I'm coming in with a clean slate here and

I'm going to listen to this this is my goal I've got all these skills I'm already making lots of money and those

things but I want a new model so in his mind he's coming in with a newb and that's the that's the teachable person

right that is a coachable person because they're like listen nothing's off the table here I've got a goal I want to do

it a certain way I know you can help me but I'm a blank slate you know I've got a beginner's mind and I was like oh okay

I like this well and this is the meta skill of learning right like if I have a superar yeah yeah Meta skill of learning

if I have a superpow it's that I can uh learn really fast because I know what I'm not good at like I got really brutal

feedback from a mentor a few months ago and I was so grateful for it cuz I was like man if he didn't give me that

feedback I wouldn't have this opportunity to learn but I realized that that's a skill that I've cultivated of going like well if my goal is here and

I'm here there's a whole lot of stuff I don't know that I need to learn and get better at and evolve into that I think a

lot of people struggle with and so yes it's skill acquisition but if we it we could people that have

levels of open to learning and we could lay out the plan and some people succeed and some people wouldn't and it's not

down to the strength of the plan it's down to the ability to embrace that and learn and be teachable and coachable to actually apply it cuz if you try and put

your spin on every s every single thing I'm unique snowflake right I'm going to try and uh you know and I I love and

hate this word alignment right I'm going to find that like the model that's aligned to me and I'm like I believe that but when you're getting your first

five clients you're not trying trying to get the five perfect the right to think yet yeah well I was listening to Grant

and um hosi it was a old interview that for whatever reason hosi pulled off his channel but it was still exists on the

internet somewhere and Grant was saying you can't go straight from broke to meaning you have to make money right you

can't be trying to like pay the bills and also trying to impact the world it doesn't work you have to so anyway all

that it say things happen in sequence so if we're talking about the foundational things and let's talk about someone's

first offer yeah because either they're at 10K a month and they only have one offer and it sucks uh and it's not

scalable or it's not attractive or you're at 50k a month and you've been in the game for a while and you've got 17

offers if someone was to come to you and they're going like I want to get to 100K a month in a way that's profitable in a

way that uh scales in a way that I like but that clients get results all those kind of things what would be that main

offer because it might be like we can get into the multiple offers like you might have an offer stack or a hybrid offer to get to 100K month but what

would be that main offer that you would encourage the average person to build out to lay that Foundation to build a

seven figure business so the average person everyone needs momentum but the average person needs momentum the most

and the thing that gets the most momentum in an offer is around the refining the promise or refining what gets done what's the outcome of going to

be like that so if you're if you're selling money which is you know getting someone to 100K a month Etc you need to

say that's our goal and that's what we're going to do M um if you're selling you know time then or you're selling

better life then you need to be um exquisitly clear about how you

articulate what the outcome is on the other side because as soon as you can inject the frame of what's going to

happen when that person with that person over the next weeks months maybe year

then your offer becomes a lot easier to buy because I think we've both said this recently most people have enough leads

if you're at if you're at 10K a month you have enough leads to get to 30k a month you just need a refinement around

the promise and what you're doing and in many cases it's refining it down to something making small promises that are

much easier to keep rather than making bigger and having um like promise inflation so I always like look around

like what gets done here in the offer what what are they actually you know what are they actually promising you

know literally and metaphorically you know in terms of sometimes the literal promise I will get you there we can talk

about guarantees um but I will get you there and this is where we're going and refining that round so it's much more

clear so they they see a bump in conversions because most people have enough leads and if you get the promise right then those leads are more likely

to convert and it's much more binary well the promise is interesting because I think people often think that the promise is the deliverables right and Promise vs Guarantee

they conflate it with a guarantee which is not the same thing of course so like my first coaching offer was 1 hour a

week for uh I don't even think I had a minimum I think it was just like 1 hour a week and this is the monthly price and it was if anyone interested it was 600

us a month so it was like $150 per hour and that was up from like the $13 an

hour I was getting paid I was like I'm rich right but I had no promise I was just like we will meet every week for an

hour and I will teach you these things and I didn't even have a lovely system it was more like oh you're a real estate

agent I'll like help you get more listings but again the emphasis was on the deliverables and so the best I would actually argue you did have a promise

and my and my lexicon of promises because you you were promising time and attention in a in a predictable amount

you were say I will spend an hour a week with you right right so that's a promise yeah of course it's it's not a promise

to say I'll spend an hour hour a week with you and you're going to be a millionaire by you know next January but

the promise is is largely defined on what they get and that's why one-on-one coaching is easier to sell than group coaching because the promise is more

easier to Define I will spend time with you yeah so it's more easier to ATT so so help me understand for a second when Dream Outcome

you say promise you talking about dream outcome or you talking about like literally the commitment you're making to someone the commitment you're making to someone okay got you I was more

thinking coming up from dream outcome that totally makes sense cuz the best metap for I've heard around that is like the you don't sound the play trip you

sound the destination and as Elementary as that sounds that help helps you sell $1000 programs and $100,000 Consulting

deals right and so when you think about that dream outcome aspect how should people be thinking about it whether it's

weight loss whether it's uh you know um anxiety whether it's money whether it's

um productivity when people are trying to figure out okay whether it's group or oneto one and we'll get to the details in a second yeah what are some of the

key things that you think people should be considering when it comes to a dream outcome let's say they're going to sell a 90day 16 weeks not a yearlong not a

multi-year thing not a onh hour Consulting deal but like a 3 to four month thing what should they be thinking

about when it comes to dream outcomes believability because what an underrated or misunderstood thing in like the the

high ticket space is a lot of people are trying to convey the authority and the confidence in the person who's

delivering it whereas in many cases you need to raise the confidence of the buyer much more than you need to raise

the confidence of the seller to actually deliver the result right so smaller smaller promises are easier to keep and

that's theistic I always use with clients of like many cases I've seen offers triple in conversion by reducing down the the

reduce down the number they go from we'll get you 100 qualified calls a month to we'll get you 10 because that

the person on the other side of it the 10 is much more relative to where they are now when they're only getting two right so 100 was the thing that didn't

convert because it seems like it's in Disneyland where it 10 feel something achievable that's actually a great example because I get cold DM every day

and they're like we'll get you20 seems to be the new number do you do the numbers on these like if you do sh rate

close rate we sell a $5,000 you're helping me get to 500,000 a month for $250 a call or some stupid thing but

but this is a great point because the first time I ever realized this I had a client called Brian Mark the fitness guy The Promise

amazing human uh in a SE of helping people get to 10K a month that was the promise of all his contemporaries his

promise was you're a personal trainer I will help you make $2 to $5,000 a month as an online fitness coach it worked to

the tune of a thousand clients for him paying him like I think it was like $300 $400 month it was a huge lesson for me

because 10K it sounds like the more obvious thing like whatever the bigger numberers like if you can confidently

say we're going to get you there then surely the bigger numbers I think it's going to help you make more sales but he was working with people that primarily

made kind of $800 to $1,500 a month selling their time burnt out and what he

was selling them was the dream of more money like in many cases it was doubling or tripling what they were making but

they could have the freedom of making uh the money in their own way on their own time and it crushed and that was where I

was like this was maybe 3 years ago I was like I don't know if I understand this promise thing as as well as I

should yeah yeah it's the people think the promise is relative to their skills

but it's relative to the market that you're in right it's relative to where the people are similar um David and

Craig who you know coached in person personal trainers in the UK again they tested all the all the different types

of messaging 10 grand a month for and when when you're at £1,000 a month as you know your take home income 10,000 is

like it's on another planet you're like in their head they need to become fundamentally a different person and

that's terrifying yeah four to five I can see how that happens and there's people like me in this in this marketing

doing that and I believe it so whenever I'm looking at offer I'm like how easy

is this promise to keep by the the practition of the person delivering it but how how valuable is it to the person

relative right now into the immediate priority because that's the key is like is it their

current priority or is it a future one because getting someone to a million bucks a year who's on you know 10K a

month that's a future priority getting them to 20K is a is a is a much more pressing current one so if you want a if

you want a great offer and and you want conversions now which you need traction and momentum for then making a smaller

promise that's relative to the market is going to be get you a lot more traction than a than a than a big you know

promise which is constantly under inflation right well I think about it through the lens of the kind of maso's hierarchy of The Hierarchy of Needs

needs right it's like you you solve the bottom needs and then you move up in the triangle and so everyone that we work

with has survival needs they have like it's a painkillers vitamins and bucket lists is basically it and so you can

talk about something on someone's bucket list and that they might go 100% I want that right but are they willing to pull

out the credit card and solve it now probably not because it's not the most pressing thing yeah and so an easy like

example I think about is in 10 Years bro I want to say goodbye to commercial flying right but I get served up ads and

get emails for like private jets all the time and I'm like not right now you know like it's not a survival need it's nice to have and so I think what's really

important to think about is everyone has like everyone's Perfect Fit prospects has that hierarchy painkillers vitamins

bucket lists and so it's not this consistent thing where it's like uh this is a good one and this is a bad one this

is a survival need and this is a vitamin every person has those unique things even in different seasons so I remember

being burnt out of my mind when we got to 100K a month uh in our agency and I

spent weeks reading books on Sops team operations I hired Alex shaen to help me

like figure out meetings and culture I couldn't have cared less at six figures about that stuff I didn't even know that

was a thing I didn't even I literally didn't even know what sop meant right and so it just goes to show that through

each evolution of my business the survival needs changed so I I think having a dream outcome that's based on a

survival need and is believable I think is the really important thing and then making sure that you're not

overemphasizing the mechanics the plane trip the seat the air conditioning on the plane but really majoring on that

Maui yeah yeah yeah I think you know I I'm a big proponent of like a hybrid

offer where you're you're selling once and you're you're selling people into multiple tiers but you're selling them over a long period of time but I still

subscribe to the fact of there is a there is a painkiller in the first 8 to 16 weeks of of the engagement in that

offer even if you're going to work together for 12 months and the dream outcome is is there you you're still

talking about in your Lexicon which I like is that that pain killer in the next we're going to remove the biggest pains in your life or your business or

your body or whatever it is over the next 8 to 16 weeks and these are the steps we're going to take because that's the that's what they're buying into

they're buying into that immediate relief they're buying into that what happens now yeah it's great I'm bought

into the the big thing yeah but they're buying into the immediate relief that's what they say yes to that's what they commit to that's what they invest

against and then you got to keep them on the track to get the the dream AR here's the key i' be intered to know what you The Dream Outcome

think on a practical level so someone's trying to figure out the dream outcome this is this is how I do it yeah you can sit there and brainstorm and dream and

open up the journal as much as you want and you might come up with some like cool things I just go ask people it's

crazy yeah yeah right so it's like so so what's really important about this is that people can over complicate this and

go but what's my what's the dream outcome I your promise it's like firstly you're not the target market this is not

for you it's for them that's critical that but right and so it's not like what are you most excited about it's what are they most excited about and this is

where it comes down to like obviously we didn't talk about it but you got to find a person you're passionate about helping

and build a business around that person rather than having 27 different possible prospects find a dream Prospect but one

of the things I do this is when I I'm launching a lead magnet I'm launching a new offer I'm trying to find an angle I'm trying to find a promise is I

literally just ask people so one of the things that I was exploring like three years ago is I was like I wonder if I

create a program that's around making money but it's around becoming a top 1% coach and that idea lasted for like 20

minutes when I DM 10 people and I said hey what do you think of the idea of becoming a top 1% coach and they're like

lame don't like it doesn't connect I was like perfect right I was messaging clients and Prospects and anyone else

and so when I come with the lead magnet I might come up with three possible lead magnets and then I DM people or I run a

poll on my Instagram or I post it on my Facebook Facebook and I say which out of these three resonates with you the most

and I think it's so uh funny how we can over complicate this the the market research process we're like oh we've got

to go on Amazon and go on R it and go on all these things and like and conduct all this research it's like or you could

just ask 10 15 20 as many people who will listen to you that are in your target market they could be already

paying you or not and just give them some options give them some wording give them some verbage see what relates to

them the most you got to pre-bake a few of those cookies right to test them out right you know I was I was talking to someone recently who had eight closes a

sales manager two or three setters I can't remember um if hell exists that's what it is exactly exactly right and I

and I and I said to them would you be interested in me showing you how to sell

the same volume that you're selling now without sales skills right right so I pre-baked their cookie because it's like I know I can

write an offer that replaces eight sales people yeah with that person cuz they've got an offer converting take all the

stuff put it into my myth ology it's great yeah like [ __ ] yeah and then you say like if you just don't tell the

closes that I'm the one that told you to fire them that would be great and if you could not sh my that's extra that's an

extra fee if I have to if I have to but but it's the same thing of like pre-baking the pre-baking the idea of

like just ask them yeah can I take this pain away from you yeah right and so you got to have some hypothesis but you can

come up with that in your own research but then you've just got to ask people yeah well this this guy you know Deja Be a Scientist

from Twitter the guy I don't know who how he looks but his name is Ruby and I pay him for Voxer coaching and he has

this phrase all the time he he be a scientist so like he'll post something about online he's like um you guys

should take more magnesium it's really good for you and everyone's like but what brand but how much and he's like just go be a scientist like figure this

out and I think a lot of us have lost that we're looking for the blueprint we're looking for a coach to sit with us

and hold her hand and say you should promise this and the reality is is that everyone's Market Niche offer is

different you're different and so there are variables at play you need to have a hypothesis and test things out get data

and we learn this so well with Facebook ads right everything was a hypothesis

you'd be like I have a webinar I think will go well so I need to create five ad angles and each ad angle is going to

have four different pieces of creative and then the ads manager and the algorithm is going to do its thing to kind of test and see what's going to be

the winning race horse we're going to bet on but when it comes to offers when it comes to like building out a business we're like looking for the best way a

through Zed rather than like being a scientist and testing these things out getting feedback not getting discouraged

and just like continuing to iterate and optimize yeah fully and I use the word hypothesis a lot and then a couple of

weeks ago someone asked me what it meant and I was like what's the and I was like it's your best guess like ah okay yeah

cuz that's literally what it is you're approaching the market you've got some knowledge you've got some idea and you

make your best guess and then you get data on it yeah by asking people running out whatever whatever the next tip is

but that is literally a hypothesis isn't something something complicated it's something it's just simply your best

guess and that you're willing you're just willing to be wrong about it I love it so 3 to four month program dream Program Dream Outcome

outcome that's believable that's based on market research and based on not what you want but a like a perfect fit

Prospect survival needs the stuff that they're like I'm willing to pay for this right now how would you deliver that

because obviously you and I came from the course world right it was like you have some modules you have a Facebook Community you have a call once a week

that's our way that can still work but if you were to tell someone based on your experience now what they should do

or what you would do if you were starting over again how would you structure that kind of first few months so the way I used to do it was

onboarding people in a linear fashion which is do this do this do this do this week one week two week three week

four have it and it and it goes like that what I found was the variables with

different people at scale who are joining programs or joining group are very very high right and the more

variables you have of the people joining your program the more you have to have infrastructure that caters for those

variables so a practical example is the more variables you have the more questions you need and the more customer

support you need the more questions you get in your group on your calls etc etc so from an efficiency point of view I

found that having a onetoone call with somebody and having and Catering for the variables there in that first instance

especially if you're still in a growth phase of giving them the map but show

them their terrain which is like you've got this you've got this here are some three or four ways to accelerate the things you've already got so they're not

going on a linear path is the highest leverage piece which is giving them the map which is the same map for everybody

but helping them plot the terrain themselves so that condenses the customization and gets them results

quicker because they can they can more use utilization some unfair advantages they've already got or assets have'

already got or resources whatever it is and and get a get a much faster start

but you've also got less support to go along the way because you've catered for most of the variables in the plan so I

found that unless you're some running something really massive you know where you're signing up dozens or thousands or

hundreds or whatever people a week then giving someone a plan at some level whether it's you or a coach or or

someone you've got there or get getting them to fill in a plan and bringing it to a place where you can do it on mass

and customize it yeah as the fastest way to condense that and give the most variables but while while still sticking

to a plan that you know they can execute and you know you can support them on yeah so I want to go granular for a Program Curriculum

second because how I see it is if you go to a Bad Doctor you present symptoms and

they give you medication and they say oh you've got you feel like this take this pill three times a day or whatever um a

great doctor will look at the foundations and the fundamentals right sleep nutrition hydration movement

sunlight stress and then based on your needs once those things are taken care of and you've dialed in the fundamentals

they give you supplements medicines whatever it might be to supplement right the foundational work that you're doing

and so when someone comes into outworld for example there is the foundational curriculum that you don't have to go at

uh through a through Zed but there are steps you have to go through before you start getting individualized

prescriptions yeah right so it's like you have to go through these modules so we we call it uh the first steps they go

through is onboarding and Mastery so it's like this is how you succeed in our world here are values this is the road

map to 100 month profit then Mastery is about kind of self-image setting goals all those types of things then we start

to get individually prescriptive right if you've already got momentum and you're making money and you just want to tweak your offer great go here if you uh

have a great offer and it's already converting in your s traffic great go here yeah and I think one of the things that people struggle with is holding

tensions do I tell them what to do or do I create a buffet and they can choose their own adventure and the answer is

both right and so I I I will State my

strong opinion here I would love to know what you think I think most people and when I say most I mean you would have to

be the reare exception should either be doing the work for people or doing it with them I would say the the rare case

is when you just teach people to do it themselves CU most people just don't have the skills or to actually create a

curriculum and create an environment and hold a community culture to where it can be hands off so I think either you're

you're providing a service yeah or you're doing one toone coaching yeah like for me this whole idea of like

scale where people are in their first 10 15 20 clients and they're trying to like hire a coach and have a community manager and have a client consur perf 12

videos that do exactly the same thing a thousand times even now I'll record a video and I'll think of 10 things I

could have said better or things I didn't include and like even at my level I'm still thinking about ways in which I

can get better and ways in which I'm dropping the ball and going oh my gosh but but do you do you agree or how do

you see that because I think so many people that the headline on the Facebook ad of stop stop Ono one coaching and

start a group program I think is a really sexy promise I think too many people don't have the skills to go straight into group coaching straight

into a leverage model I think you build programs around people rather than build

them for them okay right which is I think we're saying the same thing you you are a service provider so you get in

there and you solve problems and your skill levels go up to Pat and match how you solve those problems at scale so the

evolution of your teaching I would guess your stuff is getting shorter and more refined and it's

improving in that because you're getting better and like the average length of my training videos over the years have gone

like that because I can say what I need to say used to take me 60 minutes and

now I can do it an eight so it's like the refinement down but I I don't make

when people join my community I don't make them go through a lineer piece I

customize every single person even when they join at 300 bucks a week right now price is going up

um five spots left don't wait um the even even when they're coming in now I

give every person a 30- minute call because I know that I can save eight weeks of them going through stuff and

down into that that the next eight weeks are much more on their path and on their Journey Y and I get faster results and

also people don't leave but the most important point I think here is that you haven't graduated from one toone One to One Coaching

coaching you still do it I still do it like I've added $40,000 a month I'm recurring Revenue in the last 3 weeks

and it's all onetoone Consulting and so there's this fallacy that I see people believe that they're like they do the

hard yards of I'm doing onetoone calls and I'm you know doing the $130 an hour

type things like like I did when I started and now we're like experts and we're really good and we've graduated

out of it but I think this whole idea is firstly it's crazy cuz people graduating far too early they don't have the skills

they don't have the ability to like communicate really succinctly clearly give people what they need they don't even know what people need and I think

this whole idea of like onetoone coaching and being really Hands-On is so interesting to me because I'm getting

opportunities now where my hourly rate is $3 to $4,000 an hour right we have a

unique tax situation so that's not only mostly profit it's mostly takehome and then I compare that to the $133,000 $13

an hour I was making 5 years ago the gap between here and there is thousands of hours of one toone coaching

yeah so people go the trenches right that sounds amazing how do I create an offer around that it's like well you

probably can't because you don't have the skills and so I think there's just something to be said about creating business models that yes doesn't suck

you're not like I'm not spending 30 hours a week one to one coaching but I'll spend 5 to 10 hours a week oneto one with clients because number one it's

really profitable people love buying onetoone it's its own unique mechanism in a lot of ways right having a onetoone

coach but number two it makes me so good at what I do and I think there's just this crazy belief that people get to 10K

a month and they did the hard yards of one to1 and now we're going to launch a course and that's going to get me to seven figure freedom and I'm just going

to like check into the community once a week and I just think it's bull crap it is but but those people are trying to

get away from the pain they've already created M so they think that scaling themselves out of it is the way to do it

right so they go well this thing is causing me pain which is one to one so

therefore the thing that will provide relief from that pain is not doing one to one y and then the answer lies in a

much more Nuance place somewhere in the middle of that is it it depends but when are you like I always go back to

leverage when are you going to deploy leverage yeah when are you what complexity of you gone through so your

clients go through Simplicity right cuz that's Mastery you someone has to go through complexity because to get

extraordinary results in anything you need to understand the complex variables that go into getting results of anything

the body business relationships ever they're complicated machines and

complicated systems someone needs to go through complexity and the idea that you can just package everything up and throw

it at a client and go there you go work it out and I'll see you on Wednesday at  a.m. every week is is fiction

unless you've done an extraordinary amount of hours before that to go listen

95% of people are going to get results by doing this so someone's got to go through complexity and if you're good

then the leverage that you get from a 20 minute 30 minute you know one to one piece yeah

will provide leverage to that client which is weeks and months you know yeah

in terms of getting them back but you're rewarded for that if they're paying to stay around and the on a practical note How Many Hours

the the nuances live within the terms onetoone coaching how many hours how

frequently what are we covering on those like one of the things that I did that I made a huge mistake on when I first started one one coaching as I had my one

of my first clients I think was like coaching client number three paid for a year of one to one coaching up front so

I had 52 1our sessions did you make the did you did you offer it that it was once a week yeah yeah I did that that

was a mistake oh it was a mistake but not only that he was rich so he didn't he didn't he didn't need the coaching no

um and like that's another no one really does yeah yeah yeah but but the challenge was like he was like a wealthy investor and he wanted to share his

knowledge and so I would jump on a call with him and I would I'm trying to fill out the hour it wasn't about an outcome

it was literally like just selling the deliverable right an hour I was teaching uh and then we would assign to-do list

and then like we get back to the next week I was like hey did you do what we were talked about and he's like no I didn't I'm like how am I going to fill

this hour you know I'm like rehash same and then now all my onet to1 clients get two 30 minute sessions a week uh a month

sorry and so that's every two weeks 30 minutes I teach nothing I answer no Q&A stuff we are working on like high level

strategic game plan stuff so the nuances are not just within like skills and how advanced are you it's like you can

structure it differently uh to where clients are getting better results and you're not getting burnt out so when I

had like I got to 95,000 a month in profit in April of this year when I after I burnt everything down and I

rebuilt with one to one with 31 to1 clients but that was only8 hours of coaching per week right to make over a

million dollars like run rate and profit so it's how you structure it as well so coming back to this this 100K a month

plan that we're building for people now so 3 to four month thing dream outcome I would say more Hands-On than not and

especially in the early stages build skills get really good at what you do become obsessed with helping people um

go through complexity so they can experience Simplicity how do you think about pricing because there's not a magic price it's not like when we when

we joined Sam we keep referencing him because obviously that was our shared uh history when we started out he had a

$5,800 price point that then we all came out and did a $ 5800 5800 so it's so

much more nuanced right like depending on your skill and what you value your time at and all of that it's nuanced

someone's group program could start at at $3,500 and that might be a great price point for them starting out you

started out at 2500 other people should be double or triple that but how do you think about it in terms of putting

together that core offer uh for people to be pricing it in such a way that it's like do you look at competitors do you

like how do you think about that so I I pretty much exclusively use weekly

pricing and it's a bit of a thing M uh around around my parts um because it it

it offers the lowest now number to get started you know you're presenting a low number relative to a low number relative

to you know the high numbers that generally get presented on high ticket yeah so I found that the the the easiest

offers to to make and easiest offers to create are also the easiest offers to buy and an easy offer to buy is match

with a price that's easy to say yes to so a few hundred bucks a week you know and got clients Who start at 100 and

start at 800 relative to their to the market there in um so I think I just

with pricing I mean it's an infinitely we could do 10 podcasts on pricing because it's infinitely nuanced andely

perspective but the the the key things are for me are like lower than now number to get started the priority is getting people started it's not it's not

making profit necessarily on day one it's getting someone started and building a an LTV and building a

long-term relationship with them yeah because it's hard to sell things like you don't want to do it you you want to

minimize the number of sales you make to the number of people you make by keeping them the longest possible time so I'm a

big proponent of having pricing that makes it easy to get started for someone and that's that's obviously relative to

the market and easy to stay easy to stay because if they're paying $300 a week like because let's get into the nitty-gritty here right so it's like Pricing

someone's committing to a I can't do the math but like $300 time 16 right what is that uh don't do public math 4,800 yeah

4,800 thank you thank you James um so 4800 so what I would do is I um I I if

if you want to incentivize cash up front yeah the easiest way to do that is prepaid discounts in my experience right

so if you're not in a season of stacking recurring Revenue but you're trying to stack cash because you're trying to get yourself out of a hole Yeah having

prepaid discounts where it's like it's 4,800 paid across 16 weeks or if you want to save 20% Which is $800 you can

prepaid today and that makes it $4,000 it's the opposite of what most of the industry does which is they penalize

people who go on high ticket payments it's the opposite way right opposite frame it's $4,000 or if you want to

split your payments it's now 5,000 or 6,000 it's just arbitrary numbers you're like penalizing poor people right it's

like oh you can't afford the full amount we're going to make it more for you so it's reverse um it's not 4,800 by the

way it's 4 4,400 embarrassing embarrassing um and so so we got weekly

pricing you can have a prepaid discount if you want cash up front what I do is at the end of 16 weeks let's say you can

do a couple of things firstly this comes this is my experience is that it comes down your level of confidence if you have a killer program that's getting

amazing results you can sell a longer time frame so the 16 weeks could enter into a 12 month recurring Revenue where

the payments just keep going weekly or monthly or you can just resell in another rhythm of 16 weeks I don't like

when people go into a month-to Monon where it's truly open-ended it's like do you want to keep working together in like every month you don't know where

these clients are staying so having a time commitment is strong but I really like having a core recurring Revenue

offer that you can just resell and resell and resell again and I am a few years into this with clients where some

clients have never made more than a six-month commitment and they're still here 3 years later so it totally works do you see it the same way in terms of

going from one offer into the next CU by the way just to recap uh to clarify sorry these are not different offers

this is not an upsell this is not a downsell this is a resell would you like to continue to pay the same and

experience the same level of coaching content and Community yeah that's how I do it I I we're fully on the same page

with that and again it goes back to that selling once piece which is like to get the transformation you want you

know the dream outcome as you say it takes 12 months m in the next 16 weeks

these things get done y right so they're committing to 16 weeks but they understand if they want the dream outcome they probably should be there

for 12 months minimum y so I sell on two Dimensions the the time Dimensions is you're selling two time frames you're

selling what happens first and then what can happen over the time frame but that's a pre it's kind of like the dream

and the goal yeah right the war and the battle right yeah and then two Dimensions as well is like how fast do

you want to go mhm because the the the two Dimensions I sell is like you can

get started here for 300 bucks you get this much of me you get this this this that's enough for you know 66% of people

but based on current numbers for the other 33% who who are in my world they're like I want more access to you I

want to buy hours with you I want a private sele with you so I have levels yeah that go faster let's talk about the

levels well the other level that I'll go back to to the Daily client machine which is you know a methodology that I

launched after Authority architecture that had two like really distinct levels which was I'll help you write a book

that you can turn into a sales funer they get you high ticket clients that was the whole premise of the daa client machine right the the course and the

program of 5 grand the done for you was 50 right right so we' do we'd do the

book for them launch the funnel etc etc you literally wrote people's books I forgot about that you're not just

talking about the done for you of the selling it was like so another I wanted to introduce that because another level for some people can be Services too yeah

like one to one services and those things but the the the point is there's power laws present in groups of

customers right there is a a pretty decent cohort in most people's audiences who just want more access to you they

want to go faster they want it done for them and I believe having an offer there

you know that is multiples of the of the easy to enter $23 $400 a week piece is

the fastest way to accelerate Revenue but also understand that there's different there's differing economics in your

client base some people you know I've had people who only ever going to pay me 100 bucks and I've had people going to

have pay me multiple six figures y so it's like I I believe two Dimensions we're selling two dimensions of time

yeah what gets done in terms of what did you say the goal yeah the the dream and the goal the Dream and the goal so sell

the goal and then the dream yep and then two dimensions of like this is everything that you get there's plenty

there but if you want to go if you want to go faster you know go on the fast lane then then you can you can be here

so so with so everyone listening to this has uh probably a binary belief they're

either trying to Hash it out one offer to 1 million yeah we know that works right that can totally work right then

there are other people who have value ladders and offer stacks and they go from a $7 thing to a $97 a month thing

to blah blah blah blah again totally subjective there's no right way but how would you think about it when you're

thinking about we've got this core offer that we're helping people build out right 90 days 16 weeks weekly pricing

dream outcome it's goal not dream I love how I'm confusing people with the language it's dream but goal but it's

the the short-term time commitment with a believable podcast yeah yeah um when should people consider just totally

opinion on integrating a second offer the second offer might be completely different so if we think about on

practical ends it's a different Community different curriculum yeah and or just bolting on something to their

original offer when I say that I mean like maybe it's a community offer and then you've got one to one connected to

that I believe so this is this is this is a comes back to it depends on how

fast you want to go I believe someone should develop a 12mon road map out of the gate even if

they don't stick to that for the client with a definitive way of where you're going to take them in the first 12 to 16 weeks so I believe that people should

develop a 12-month Roat for the client just to give themselves some certainty and have something to sell into and you

know and if you already have a front end offer where you're just serving someone for 8 to 16 weeks one of the easiest

offers to make after that is like do you want to stick around and keep getting support yeah well why the road map is The Road Map

important because because the biggest objection I hear from clients that can't figure out how to keep clients is they

like we've done everything you're like then create more things to do and more problems to solve like each problem you

solve creates another problem to solve so what you're saying is identify more problems and solutions than just what

you intend to solve in the first 16 weeks so that reselling becomes easy that's the first piece then what's the

second piece to that that it's Dynamic mhm that it it's not I think people think that they have to have a 12 month

road map that is fixed and at the the the early you are in the beginning the more variables that you have to

introduce you go actually they can do that three-month period and three weeks right but this threat but based on

experience the the three weeks I gave them to do that thing that's actually takes them three months cuz it's complicated right so the road maps a

dynamic and and you need to set you need to have a Dynamic approach to to where the clients are going but it's again

it's a hypothesis this is the best guess about what clients needs to do in the next 12 months to to achieve the dream and and then sticking to that and then

being Dynamic within it to to actually change the order and sequence if you need to yeah like we're always responsive to clients right yeah we talk

about what you're making for your guys and I'm making for my guys all the time it's like I feel in my Waters that they

kind of need a bit more jumping on a community call being like so I saw James km say this and I'm

like mother no kidding um but it's is so funny with business models and stuff like that so so how I did it this year

so this year was like a reset for both of us like like we could do 10 podcasts about the hilarious journey of like our

our stories and you were selling software 5 minutes ago and not even doing consulting um what I did is I did

one: one first yeah and then I capped out a one to one and I'm a huge fan of telling people to at least start with

something like CU it is easy to sell yeah much easier when you say I'm giving you my time I'm holding your hand we're

in the trenches together much EAS easier to sell than saying here's a course login all the best right it's it's

easier to sell now especially when people have gone through courses and programs where they didn't get results for yes and the straight out we came out

of the gate saying a similar thing which is like you've done the courses you've done the programs and all you want is

someone to help you assemble the good stuff yes so so what I did is it was uh one to one and then I filled that up and The Hybrid Offer

then I was like I can either just get more Ono one clients which was not appealing I could either just charge more which was appealing in the sense

that I didn't want to move those 30 clients through a price increase and all that kind of stuff um and so all I did

was create a community version of that and the community visual that if we just get it visual here okay so how you and I teach this right I

think you call it the hybrid offer I don't have a name for it but basically like there's one to one and the one to

one that I sold was there's no curriculum so you're just getting my time there was no I think we had a slack

Channel and then I built out the community and the community was half the price no one to one with me one call a

week and a now a school group right so let's just say it's 1500 a month for community and 3,000 a month for one: one

what's really beautiful about this particular stack is the one: one does not have a CPR group it does not have C

curriculum it doesn't have separate group calls they have all the same group calls so we've got content coaching and

community and this and then all that's happening is some people pay more for

time with us crazy and this is what I like is again it's so subjective so many

ways to make money so many ways to get to 100K a month but I would say is the best way yeah yeah but but I would say

what I would do is you fill your cup with onetoone clients you get insanely

good at what you do controversial right I know you get you really good at what you do you charge a premium for it because you're selling a time and then

you can bolt on a community you can do it either or but what I would say is if you start with a community you're not

getting the rips in when it comes to Fig like the the um feedback loop is too

long if if you got someone 10 people in a community it's harder to know how many

people are winning and what they're struggling with if the only checkpoints you have is this person comes to a community call every 3 weeks right

there's no oneto one chicken so I really like starting one to one and going to group but here's what I would

say that's kind of where I would cap out to go to 100K a month is that you don't

then need this and then this and then another thing I think to get to 100K a month it's like you could do it with one

offer I think the sexiest way that I like is basically it's one offer it's one content one Community it's just that

some people get one to one and some people do not and the price reflects that this is the simplest model that

I've seen to get to 100K a month i' I'd love to know like what do you think of that kind of model cuz I know we have very similar models and then there's one

one other we need a third person in the room to argue against this like there there isn't a lot of contrari and stuff

I'm G to come up with here but but I would really love to know um where do things like

uh oneoff things come in right so so let's just say people are bought in on this they're going to have one to one

and they're going to have Community but I know in your world uh you have um you know paid days people pay for days there

are events that you run there are paid workshops so obviously youve got these core things how do you think about these

auxiliary things these like periphery things where they're not the main offers you've not spending all of your time promoting this one thing uh cuz we're

going to talk about funnels and getting clients shortly and how to fill these but but how do you think about those things because I think one of the things

that people really struggle with is holding the attention of like like I had a client today that just made me lose my mind where he was like oh yeah I've

decided I'm running a retreat in January so I'm just going to pause all promotion for my offer until then just to fill the

event I'm like so you are anyway so that's a tension that people find

themselves in is they it's like juggling balls and spinning plates and because these ones aren't going very well then I launch another one and the these ones

are suffering and this one so how do you think about those things I try and make these distinctions as best I can without

having an iPad and like you know sketching them out so I I see there's two classes of people that that I

transact with in my business there's customers and a customer will buy a training and a workshop with a defined

you know a defined input and those are customer products and I sell those for between 100 and 500 bucks right so

they're customers they have transacted with me they get a training they'll get a workshop it's to find them what they

get then I have clients clients I dedicate energy I dedicate thought care

Etc to and you know clients are there and they're making a commitment to come into my world and I'm making a

commitment to them clients can enter my world like in a community for as low as 300 bucks and then they can buy like you

there's another level of do you want to go faster do you want more access that's the next level up but I also sell ad hoc

hours that you can buy in bunches of four and 10 mhm um and then you can buy days with me or

I I run a retreat every 3 to four months at the moment y so what I found is that

in that client stack that it allows people to choose their own adventure because they're already kind of

pre-planning their time in their year you know I've got tons of people coming in January both in terms of to one off

days with one: one but also a retreat at the end of January too and they're like I'm getting there I'm coming over I'm

going to plan the year Etc I'm using The Syndicate which is my community to kind of you know keep going along and that's

the Baseline so I've I've found that having multiple levels just allows

people to choose their own adventure but it also maximizes LTV because sometimes people want a couple of hours with me to

do a particular job you know and do that thing but they don't want to commit to one to one ongoing yeah and and I find

it's it's offers the highest level of flexibility for me and the highest level of flexibility for them but the other

distinction I want to make is a difference between offers and products because when I look at the client stack :00 I've Got The Syndicate and The Syndicate plus one one and then The Syndicate Plus :05 hours and The Syndicate plus you know Retreats or or VIP days then those are :11 individual products but I can also I have an offer that encompasses all and all I R all I really want to do is get :18 people into my world and then they can choose their own adventure as they go along yeah and that means that I have :23 onethird of people who join The Syndicate get something else within the first six weeks they either get hours or :29 they commit to a retreat or anything like that yeah so there's a variable at play here that we need to talk about :34 it's the elephant in the room stress everything you just described :40 sounds like hell or it's easy and it's amazing depending on this variable of :45 stress for someone yeah sure and so our business model is really unique :51 and we we'll talk about getting clients and team and things like that short but I can't speak for you I have 0% :58 business stress like my stress my stress exists with kids bro like my 5 my :05 seven-year-old is like waking up at  in the morning I'm like bro I'm losing my mind right so when I have like I'm :11 running an event in LA in 6 weeks I have four guest spots the rest of clients :17 I've sold one of those guest spots already I'm confident those three will fill I also don't care like I don't have :24 any stress associated with that so if I sent an email and I was like I'm going to try and sell some hours I have no :30 attachment to whether or not those hours sell we have very high-profit businesses I have no stress I'm just having fun for :37 most people the challenge is when you have your core office I don't even know what I was using :42 before and they're not working very well and then you add :48 in all of these different things definitely now you've just spread your energy thin and you've increased your :54 stress and so I think that's a really important variable to think about is that like until you are at a point where :59 energy is abundant where stress is minimized you should be doing the fewest things humanly possible 100% agree you :06 should be trying to get those things the phrase you used is when it's not working well yeah and the Instinct that people :12 have is when something is not working well is not to make it work well it's to add something else that doesn't work :18 well yeah now you've got two things that don't work well you don't have the you :23 don't understand why the other thing isn't working well so you add [ __ ] I said said a line the other day I was :28 like man I put this up on Twitter it wasn't that good but people were quoting it and I was like um we would rather :34 throw intensity at new things than throw consistency at old things yeah and I think like this is just such an important thing to think about because :40 this is where the Nuance is right there is no right way and no amount of offers :46 that you can or can't have to make a lot of money but it's all predicated on you :51 as the business owner your passions the people you serve your capacity like earlier this year the idea of even been :57 having this conversation and entertaining entertaining Live Events and things like that would have been so far from my version of reality because I :05 was going through this phase of firing my team and trying to get profits back on track now when I'm like sitting down :12 and I've got a community and I've got people who buy one to one and then last week I got my first $112,000 a month :17 client that variable with then there's no structure with that so that's what's even more interesting is there's no set :23 calls I'm just there to help launch a book right that would have been crushing because i' been like in the midst of the :29 broken bus I've added in this whole other thing I need to think about and I've got someone texting me so now I've got slack and I've got messenger and :35 I've got someone texting me but now it's great I've got capacity and this is the big thing when people think about business model and offers is that :42 there's no one thing or right thing but there are principles that should guide us sure and stress I think is one of the :47 biggest variables that people need to be aware of you likely won't solve stress by selling more things yeah or hiring :54 I mean this is controversial but like the idea that you can just hire your way out of stress can sometimes work but if :00 things are already really bad unless the only stressful thing on your calendar is :06 the thing that that person is going to solve bringing more people into the chaos of your business will likely not make it feel bitter it will make it feel :12 worse yeah I like that I like that in terms of like the selling things will it doesn't take the stress away it it :19 largely adds them yeah I the I go back to sequence and the sequence that you describe :25 before is I think people need to pick up on the fact that you and I aren't the right to :32 go through that sequence really quickly mhm like in a pretty similar different timelines but not too dissimilar in :39 terms of what we've done and what we're doing um in the amount of time we spending with each other is clearly you know something's rubbing we share we :45 share a fence guys we share a fence no that's that's that now the cat's out of the bag with that one the news is out we :50 started a cult but the the sequence of oneto one adding a community then you :57 adding you know um higher ticket you know Mentor it's it's that's mentorship :02 that you're doing now in in the TR in the truest sense because it's unstructured it's like how how would you think about that kind of :10 Engagement some people are going to that sequence some people are going to take years to do that because they haven't :16 done all the Reps that you've done y but you can follow the sequence there cuz I followed a similar sequence I got 161 :23 to1 clients at 12 bucks a week yeah and I did that for 4 months and that's all I did and I was in safety because I was :31 making enough money and I was fine and I had Consulting revenue from other things you know on the side and I was :36 offloading some other things that were still making money but I was like offloading those to reduce the stress :42 because I knew on the other side of the 16 that then I'd add a community and then I made a slight tweak to the one to :48 one which I went from the the same model that you're running which is like this is how many calls you get to to variable :54 calls on Demand right which is and that dropped the call volume by 40% which created more capacity but I still didn't :01 raise the number of one to one clients because I'm like cool I can get capacity back time and energy to scale but all :07 along the way the hidden thing for me was I only do calls on Tuesday and Thursday so I don't feel stressed :14 whatsoever um but because I put put constraints on what I was prepared to do :20 and unprepared to do in terms of feeding those things in so that also I think that helps in not getting caught up with :26 the the nonsense that people have of like this is one to one is it scalable is it like could like questioning the :32 modality when really like if you just do calls on Tuesday and Thursday I had an unusually heavy day yesterday did seven :38 calls right and it was like that's okay what have I done today yeah come here :44 and talk to you and I went went to breath work and like but it's like the the sequence I think the thing that :51 people don't miss is that time Dimension that you can go through that sequence really quickly whereas someone listening :56 to this might need to do do that over 3 to four years Y and last note on this before we talk about funnel is sometimes :03 it's not even about logic it's about emotion in the positive sense right can we both double our business by doing :11 nothing else and just growing the things we have yes yes do we want to do other things because it sounds fun yes and so :18 you know did I need to add an in-person events for my community sell I don't think I did but it sounds fun like I'm :24 in La next month running an event I'm in Japan in March running an event that sounds fun and so this is where it's :30 also not about need like oh but do we need it's like you can get to a point if you have high recurring Revenue High :36 profit low stress you don't have to be super strategic and everything have to be logical you can simply do stuff just :42 cuz you want to do it yeah I'll share this because it's been amusing for me I :49 I have not taken any PID PID and Fs this year really and I controversial I I I do :57 with partner offers CU like 20K up front and it's a it's a chunk of work cuz I'm co-writing co-creating an offer with :03 someone but there is no pay plan because we just get straight into it and that's a particular type of type of partnership :09 but for my scalable you know coaching Consulting I've not taken a :16 painful every month I've increased Revenue by at least 14 to 20% my :23 recurring Revenue proportion is over 80% of monthly Revenue so I'm like by all :28 and I'm and I made six figures profit this month M didn't quite make six figures last month but I will this month :34 and by every conceivable metric is going up but it's boring yeah isn't that isn't :41 that weird to say that I felt a couple of times of that grind up of just watching the everything just go up yeah :49 and it i' at a couple of moments I felt frustrated with it that I want to feel :55 that that time I did 100 Grand in a day I want a rush from it yeah it still happens to me yeah cuz I've had 100 :01 Grand day before I had a like I've got a striped screenshot to bloody prove it of of 100K coming in right and I was like :10 that felt amazing I want that feeling again yeah it's not on any scalability :18 on any like business completely irrational but those feelings still come :24 but that doesn't mean we're completely led by our feelings because our feelings will implode our :29 business uh because sometimes the feeling is this is boring but I but I :34 have been particularly susceptible to that right so I had to share that cuz I'm very proud of myself I mean if we're :40 getting very honest I had to have many conversations earlier in the year when I was like a couple of months ahead of you :45 in terms of the new model and you were like I'm thinking about doing this I'm think about doing this and I was like yeah talk down from the ledge just do :51 this yeah yeah yeah talk down from the ledge f so let's talk about getting clients because we talk about offer pricing model um and we can talk about :58 team as well to wrap up to kind of round out the 100K a month yeah what's a team um I say that as I'm about to hire four :05 people and I can talk about that as well um getting clients hasir evolved and also the fundamentals haven't changed :12 and uh we need to stand out in a way that um we don't look like every other coach I remember when I first started :19 selling our coaching offer in 2020 um I'd done coaching previous to :24 that but I was mainly running an agency I ran an offer we would get sales calls I was doing the sales calls earlier and :30 I was like hey how are you different from XYZ person right super common then :36 we were like selling groups and it was like the next iteration of our offer and I was like how are you different from this other person who's also selling :42 groups now I don't get that question ever yeah right and so there's a :47 marketing kind of content positioning piece that we can talk about here but let's talk about the fundamental pieces :53 of of how you would go about getting to 100K a month if you're making some money :58 and you're trying to scale up your acquisition trying to get enough leads lead nurture conversion how would you :04 think about that right now and let's say someone doesn't have any money to spend on paid ads or they have very little so :10 it's probably going to be organic to start out with what would you suggest platform strategy all of those kind of :16 foundational things yeah so let's make the assumption that everybody's on something y from the beginning they're :22 on they're on some social media some many people on Facebook some are on Instagram some on cocaine you know maybe :28 all of the above um I I believe in terms of when you're talking about if we we I :33 always work backwards towards the market so I always start at offers and then I work backwards towards the marketing :39 because everything you want to happen in the back end is just there's just fractals of what happens in the front so :46 I'm I'm big on the big idea you know what is that dream outcome that you're taking people towards and you're :51 starting to shape that up that you can going over the next 12 months I'm going to take people here because they need to :58 be pre-old on that idea of that before they before they buy anything yeah so I'm I'm big on having a big idea :05 pre-selling the big idea of you're going to become this like I've got this concept of a CO Sovereign consultant right how to make a million bucks a year :11 with 50 clients or less like it's it's a binary concept like you either buy into that or you don't like there's no :17 judgment around that yeah so the more I talk about that Concept in the in the platforms of choice that I use the more :24 people start to buy in that that idea and their curiosity leads them down the track what's the Sovereign consultant :29 what are the characteristics how do you know how do I access different pieces of those so I framing up a big idea is :37 usually around the identity like what identity you're helping someone become or if you're truly unique around :43 identity and mechanism like what mechanism you're using so big idea :48 unique unique mechanism you know those are those are proven Concepts and then talk about it and incessantly on the :54 platform that people are paying attention on and then when you get people engaging with that you understand their intent like to the point where if :01 you're really at the beginning you need to know why that person liked that post :07 what level of intent was that was that intent like it's your grandma showing you support or is that intent of like :13 hey I'm picking up what you're putting down this might be worth the conversation yeah so at the beginning you've got the time to tune into the :20 intent signals of how people are interacting with your stuff but you've got to make stuff in the first place :25 yeah and that's where people struggle with content is like what do I talk about but and then if you've got that :31 big idea you can pull bits out of it and talk about those you know the pieces of that big idea as you go along and then :37 understand how people interact with it so it's all about content like ads are :43 content organic is content video is content written is content you got to :48 make content on the platform that you're already on that's getting some Traction in a way that is natural to you that is :55 consistent and sustainable yeah you do video I write like they they we we're :00 both making a lot of content but we're doing it in different modalities that suit us because we can be consistent y :06 you can make consistent video I can write you know till the cows come home so one platform y one idea you know and :16 then and then it's just doing the Reps on the on the content and pulling the ideas and then understanding as people :21 engage and and what intent is behind it and you I could trust you for the the smart stuff I'm going to give people the :26 dumb stuff so firstly like you can obviously do make good videos make offo :32 um post a tweet so there's uh a lot of ways to get clients right like there's I :37 like I'm friends with people who send cold emails yeah and that's not appealing to me not cuz it doesn't work :42 totally works everything works that's the problem yeah yeah but I think there are pros and cons depending on the business you're trying to build and so :48 one of the issues with let's say like you just send 100 cold DS a day totally works and I think it's a great way to :53 it's a great thing to peer alongside creating content the problem is the moment you stop sending the messages is :59 the moment the leads stop coming in yeah as opposed to building an audience that has a connection with you that's an asset that lasts longer than the moment :05 of piece of content you've just created yeah and so I think the thing that we can both agree on is that you need one platform right when people are getting :11 started they shouldn't be doing five different platforms a redistribution strategy I'm posting tweets here and shorts here and Tik toks here one :18 platform my two favorite platforms I'd be interested to know what you think about LinkedIn but I personally like Facebook Facebook and Instagram Facebook :25 is so damn easy to start organically you just add people and your audience :30 literally grows like that Instagram much harder to grow organically we're posting two reals a :36 day right now um and we I'm getting really decent growth like 10 to 20 people a day and then I might be on a :42 podcast and like I think I've had like a th Facebook uh Instagram followers in the last month so it's been working well :47 organically but typically the only traction that I see clients consistently get is when they're running ads yeah so :53 if we're talking no budget it's Facebook what do you think about LinkedIn and :58 then how do people choose what platform that they should use all of the platforms work yeah so for me it's :04 always the one that they're already on that they're getting traction on right and I've had a couple of clients recently going I don't think my people :10 are on this platform and like walking away from like 14k followers on Instagram and you're going I think my :17 people are on LinkedIn it's like don't do like you it's it's 8020 you're incrementally at it I'm I'm I'm my two :24 platforms are Facebook and email right because I use Facebook to get people onto email where I can make offers yeah :31 that's all and also Facebook's a really good platform uh in the sense that the :37 people we are trying to reach also spend a lot of time on it as their primary thing so James and I don't feel any :43 smarter when we sit around scrolling the newsfeed but it's easily the opposite :48 it's easily my favorite platform to get started on you post content it's where the majority of like if you're talking :54 about volume the most amount of people in any app are on Facebook right even to this day people who don't use Facebook :01 their their screen time would show otherwise everyone is using it in some capacity it has messenger it's great you :07 can post stories you can send messages you can um post content on your newsfeed :13 and it's relatively easy to get leads because you just add people and you can go into Facebook groups and you can add :18 people now some of you might be saying well I just want people to like track me down and you're like great earn that :24 right but in the beginning when you're just starting out you need to you need to pursue the leads to then earn the right to be pursued yeah when it comes :30 to content uh let's say people are choosing a platform yeah right I think they need to choose the thing that :36 they're Mo they're best at I don't know if and and they can be consistent now yeah ex that's where the results come :42 from so let's talk about that I think a lot of people are like I have to write yeah and they hate writing yeah or that :48 like I have to make video and they're terrible on camera the the like likelihood of you being of you :54 consistently doing something that you hate and you're like really bad at is very low damn I tell you what sometimes :00 as see people making videos I'm like you've got a face for radio baby stop making videos I see people write and go :06 you need to be on video yeah yeah 100% so it's it's what can you do consistently yeah and then because it :12 all works it all works yeah I like I like the distinction between Facebook :18 and Linkedin that you have connections literally on Facebook it is human to to :23 have your connection Twitter Instagram YouTube I'll include Tik Tok I'm not :29 even on T I don't understand it um you have followers so on one platform you :34 have connections yeah so you're one step down the down the relationship you know :40 hierarchy on the others you have followers which is like vague levels of interest that people might pay attention :46 to your staff or leave a thumbs down on your YouTube video but Facebook Facebook and Linkedin the m fact that you can :53 have a connection means that you can get traction faster because you are one step closer to literally developing a :58 relationship and talking to a person whereas on the other on the other one they're following you then you need to :04 understand whether you have a connection and you can start a conversation to have that so you just get traction faster on :10 those platforms because the very nature of the way that you can 100% you've got like you you're connecting with John :18 Johnson on Facebook and he has his real photo and he's got pictures of his kids and then you go on Twitter and you've :24 got Surfer guy 79 uh you know talking crap and he's got a picture of a cat but like my favorite :31 story around this is to kind of understand the difference in the quality of followers the distinction is like on Facebook you can never do business with :37 people who have profile pictures of babies dogs or a cars yeah yeah yeah :44 100% so but never to work one of my favorite stories to kind of illustrate this point was a girl had 1.5 million :49 Tik Tok followers yes and she said she was going to do a meet up in LA she did a meet up no one came and this is also :55 true of Twitter like I know plenty of people on Twitter that have more um :00 followers than they make dollars per month that's not uncommon that would be the norm that's normal right then for us :06 we've made Millions from thousands of people not tens of thousands not hundreds of thousands singled digit :12 thousands so it's I haven't even maxed out my Facebook friends yeah yeah exactly I'm in the minority in that I've :18 only got like two and a half or 3,000 or whatever the number I love it kill a head right how I made um but anyway so :25 so it all the all that they all work but I do think they have really obvious pros and cons like that's why I do like um :31 Facebook over Tik Tok it's not that it can't work I had someone Reach Out me the other day he helped people get :37 clients with Tik Tok he had a million of followers he was broke yeah right so it's just different platforms one of the :44 things that I've become really passionate about and I think we would be really similar to this is your platforms are Facebook and and email not just :52 because email is a really cool platform but there's just a distinct um well tell tell me really quickly to :59 help it flesh out the the kind of your thinking behind it of the relationship you feel you have with people who read :05 your newsletter or your kind of daily email so don't want to get like too scientific but different different :12 platforms and different communication channels have different levels of entropy so if you're posting something :18 on Instagram the life cycle of that is 24 hours MH literally it's like it's :24 there and pretty much gone even if it's in the feed or those things very few things have any life cycle past a few :31 days at the other end of the social spectrum is YouTube we can watch YouTube videos from 5 six 10 years ago and :38 they're still great so they have low they have just low levels of Decay there's still assets there email is a is :45 a unique Channel because it's got pretty low levels of like I have people responding today to emails I sent two :51 weeks ago so there's like like like a there's a low level of entropy that doesn't every email adds something to :57 the communication channel it's one of the last private like understanding :02 privacy and the private channels that if I send you an email you know that you're the only person who's reading it whereas :08 in Social we've got this kind of even though the algorithms even though the algorithms are tuned to us we're like :14 everybody's seeing it so email's got a personal thing and and and the third thing with email is that you own it yeah :21 which is the unique thing you I mean these days that's less true because people are being deplatformed and those kind of things yeah but you know largely :28 you own the list you should back it up but but if you have somehow been deplatform from email you've done something really wrong you really you're :35 on a list somewhere yeah and so so why I brought that up is because my preferred is like Facebook and YouTube for for me :42 personally and why I like that is because even though you can write long on Facebook it just it's a clunkier :47 platform like the scroll like you write 500 words on Facebook it's just harder to navigate there's ads vying for your :55 attention and so the peering of kind of thinking short form and long form Facebook is amazing for awareness :01 growing your audience engagement having a long form platform for depth connection trust like that real sense of :09 personal connection is amazing and so when I started YouTube uh 5 months ago firstly I knew I should have started it :15 5 years ago that was literally plan number one and then I joined Sam M's program he's like content stupid just run ads and I was like PR of the people :23 and so we did that um and then I cired back start of the year and I was like I'm going to do this and my business has :28 just gone like this since I started uh creating long form content and it's because people binge it like so firstly :36 this is going to be 2 hours by the time we're done there will be some die hards still listening there will also be some :42 die hards who listen to the first one there will also be some die hards that go straight from this one into another one right I'm a high YouTube consumer if :50 I have high screen time it's mainly me listening to to stuff on YouTube and so having something that people can go :55 really deep with you on is a really powerful thing to do the problem with most people is they post lots of content :01 and they wonder why with all of their consistency why there's not this audience being built even if it's :06 building wide it's not going deep because you haven't given them anything to really latch on to so this is why :12 Twitter you have I mean when I see the amount of posts that tweet like Twitter people have uh done cuz it's got the :18 little metric they've got like 100,000 followers and they've tweeted 100,000 times I'm like my my brain explodes I :26 may have done I may have done a thousand posts on Facebook I have no idea but but my point being you have to follow :32 someone on Twitter for so long to ever consider giveing them $5,000 yeah right and so I really like this peering and so :39 however people do it I think whether they do one platform and they post short things and then they do long videos like :46 X Twitter we we've been calling it Twitter this whole time we're so we're like so old right now so X baby it's :52 going to date this content real so so I think you can have the same effect if you just drop podcasts and YouTube and :58 things like that like long form on Facebook the point is you should have content consistently right that's short :04 medium long right you can post stor can access easily to binge yes because this characteristic of binging is super :10 interesting to me and I've got a very poorly defined like concept around total attention time cuz when I was doing :16 sales calls I always used to hear this thing of like just before someone would would jump on a call they're like oh :21 used to i i i i binged your content right and then they they turn up the next day and buy stuff right and I've :27 got this theory of total attention time that if there is a if there's a um a lump of time that people spend with you :33 intensely over a period of time and that's condensed like they they they watch they watch you every day for seven :41 days the the likelihood that that they're going to become a client or reach out to you or take an action on that is like multiple times of someone :48 who's watched exactly the same content over 12 months y and you need somewhere that allows that total attention time :55 like YouTube allows it it allows people to bench on your stuff email does as well because people can actually you :02 know sort and categorize things and look for them the other social platforms less so because of algorithms and it you can :08 have profiles and those kind of things but it's not natural for people to go and click on someone's profile and read everything necessarily they did and :14 that's why Facebook groups work really well because it allows people to go to one place and consume stuff in a really convenient way yeah so you need a place :20 where you're going to make consistently but I think you also need a place where people can binge binge your stuff and go :26 deep on it before they actually make the decision because most sales happen before the sale has taken place right y :33 so people are posting they've picked a platform they should be posting consistently I would say every day and :39 whether people say that is that 5 days or seven days the answer is yes right pick one um short medium long right so I :46 post on my stories every day sometimes it's absolutely nothing sometimes it's client testimonial sometimes it's linking to a training I post on the news :52 feed when I feel like it and then I do right now we're at four YouTube videos a week but that's only one me actually :58 sitting down and creating a video the other three are recordings of calls and things like that so I think whether you :04 just start with one and I think the easiest place to start honestly for most people is like a podcast like if they just have conversations in personal :10 virtually some people aren't ready to look at a camera and hold people's attention for 10 15 20 minutes on a :17 topic which is fine have conversations with people you find fascinating uh just make sure that there's a conversation :22 happening and not an interview because then the person that that your audience member is listening is getting to know the other person and still has no idea :28 who you are but I think short medium long on a very practical note I'll share this you can add anything uh there's :35 four types of content that I've found in terms of like main piece of content teach show share give teach what you :41 know um share who you are show client results and kind of how how what you do Works give people opportunities to take :48 next steps with you give away assets who wants this comment below post on the stories see me a DM and then regular :55 calls to action that could be weekly in small doses as in like if you want to find out more information about this or :01 monthly or cyclical like six to eight weeks around cash campaigns doors closing stuff like that that's how I see :07 it from a practical perspective anything you want to add on that yeah I've got the three PS which is proof problem and philosophy right so the proof is like :15 client results and I like to give client results of insight like what step I I think testimonials are [ __ ] :20 personally because I don't people don't pay attention to them and people they're always crafted in a way to manipulate :27 somebody like lots of marketing I've got this like case study format which says here's Bob and he made 100 Grand and :33 these are the three steps he took to do it and I find that it replicates much better for people to go that could be me :39 and the proof Factor philosophy is like who are you what do you believe you know what's your worldview and those things :45 and occasionally being pretty um polarizing in there like State what you believe nowadays in the safest possible :51 way maybe not everything you believe but you know the things that are definitely digestible and then problem which is you :57 know the functional solving of the of the pains that people are in in front of them and like giving them assets to do it or or solving a problem with them so :04 let's talk about how to stand out yeah so you're creating content short medium long right stuff that disappears in a :09 Day stuff that has some kind of lasting effect and stuff that people can binge they've got the Frameworks proof :15 philosophy what was the third one uh problem problem perfect how do people :20 stand out yeah because they can listen to everything we're talking about they're like I started the podcast and it's not working um I think it's what's :26 really important to to note for anyone who stumbled on this I know cuz this is what it gets into the real Nuance of the :32 person exactly so people who might have stumbled onto this need to know neither of us sell with sales calls yeah so the :39 cheapest thing I sell is 18 Grand I think yours is probably similar um and it happens without a sales call and :46 these aren't old leads these aren't people that have followed me for 5 years some of these people like 5 days into my world but they done the total attention :53 time they've gone deep and Etc the key that like I I'll just mention some of the feedback that I get is to why people :59 work with me is um and I never used to get this feedback this is all this year when I really focused in on it so one of :07 the things I I hear a lot is um I don't really know why you're standing out like :12 I've been really loving your content but I feel like there's something different about your energy right and this can :18 come down to silly things like we joked earlier uh a few months ago early this year about me buying chickens and so I'm :25 living here in barley we live a very similar life but I have chickens and you don't that actually makes us different :30 people to other people's perception a only a certain type of person uh has :36 chickens you've got a dog but if you had a cat you'd be a certain type of person that if you shared that online it would :42 be a differentiator right if you were the exact same person but you're here was blue like if you like bleached blue :48 here the perception of who you are would change you could be saying the same things but :54 people perceive you in a different way so one of the mistakes those people make is they try and pretend to be someone :00 they're not so they go oh Dan's got chickens I'm going to buy a chicken and I'm going to post a photo on mine and :05 that's a stupid example of things people do all the time they get the Miami Penthouse they get the Rolex they're :10 having cigars with the boys they're taking whatever it might be they see what someone else is done and they replicate it but the problem is it's :17 what uh what works is authenticity yeah so talk to us about like how people can :22 stand out more not just through being b or smarter but being more of :28 themselves the old topic of like being yourself is like the infinite the infinite game roide yeah it's Pandora's :34 Box and you're like but my my personal experience is the more that I am true to :41 myself in terms of sharing what I'm going to do and what I've done before :46 and what I'm doing now the more attractive that is and :52 the biggest the biggest influx if you like of attention that I've got this year is when in July I posted my plan to :01 get to 3 million bucks and then 52 days later um 3 million a year just 3 million :06 a year and 52 days later I posted my progress to the plan when I had 100K y :12 monthly recurring revenue and then I have updated that twice since y there :18 is a huge Dar of leaders in the world a Dar an absence there's [ __ ] all leaders :25 in the world and people want something to follow right so and your and your you :31 have you haven't crafted an identity you didn't get the chickens to look good on the internet you got the chickens cuz :38 you like animals right and people are like I admire Dan because he's doing what he wants to do bro it's killing me :44 I've got one disa chicken that everyone's tell bring with you our new :50 we can't talk about the chickens you've left but no I'm not playing a character on the internet pretends to :55 like no it's it's just the're real chickens I've seen them I picked them up um but there's the to me it's like how :02 do you stand out you be a leader right and for me I did it a different way which is like this is what I'm going to :08 do M and then I did it yeah which like if you think about it is extremely rare yeah in in the world today I said this :14 is what I'm going to do this is my update against that and this is what this is what I'm doing next and everyone :20 goes that so cool that's amazing I now trust you more than I did before because :27 they're like and I said this is what and there were two things on there that I'm not doing and I didn't do and I'm like :32 this is why I changed my mind on these things cuz I got I was in the trenches and I did it and I changed my mind on a :38 couple of things that was my way MH and in the in the course of being very :43 transparent about why I did that and you've been very transparent about why :48 you're doing what you're doing and to me that like it all comes back to that y why are you doing this yeah because :56 without a reason why people have no resonance with the reason if if your :02 reason why of buying a Miami Penthouse and those things are like really strong and valid yeah to you and they're :10 established to you people will follow along with that if your reason why is like because the other people did it :16 they won't yeah so exactly the same people can take exactly the same actions but if the reason why is absent in in a :23 true sense then everybody knows it Y and if you treat your audience like fools or :28 the treat treat people like fools who are watching and going I'm just doing this because everyone else is doing it :35 they don't pay attention it's congruence right that's what we're looking for that always is so sensitive to as human beings finely tuned [ __ ] detectors :42 yeah well I I so finely tuned I'm in the process of moving doctors right now and so I've been dealing with like thyroid :48 stuff and I'm trying to find like this guy and I sent I sent him uh to to a friend and I was like do you know :53 anything about this guy and he's like I know almost nothing but the stuff that I've seen I believe you really believes :59 it and I just think he has awesome energy and just intuitively it feels like the right move for you and I was :04 like that's really interesting and then we went on this rant of talking about energy and like picking people's up uh :10 uh picking uh up people's intention and congruence and authenticity and so before anyone thinks that their job now :17 if they're a fitness coach is to post their business plan to Facebook of I'm :23 I'm at 10K a month and I want to get to 30k a month and the people who the single Ms who want to lose weight that the say clientele don't don't care what :30 you're really talking about is also motivation and why and authenticity and congruence because one of the clients :35 that I work with uh works with people in like I can't remember what the language is but it's basically like you're in :41 physical pain but it's neurological right so it's like sematic pain relief or something like that and he is so :47 passionate about what he does because he helped his mom heal chronic pain through kind of his process and so that's his :53 whole motivation I've had worked with someone else before who was a weight loss coach who um helped his mom lose :58 150 pounds and like saved your life and so there's that particular piece that I think is really key which is that like :04 if you're just showing up as someone on the internet trying to sell something um you lose the ability to connect with people to a deep level because people :10 want to know why you're doing what you're doing yeah let's talk about some practicals around tone and kind of :16 personality so you I was showing you my AI bot before the the Dan AI and I'm so :21 excited to roll that to client it's it's hundreds of hours of my it's been trained on hundreds of hours of my :27 content but what it's missing is tone so I'm like almost happy with it like it :33 says stuff that I wish I would say or I did say once upon a time that I forgot right but it's missing tone and so it :40 doesn't sound like me MH one of the things that I found that really interesting when I first started uh on :46 the online space was LinkedIn especially was this hilarious place where people :52 pretended to be someone they weren't and so you would look at their profile and it was like advisor investor five times :57 founder and then you do a sales call do dot dot they're like yeah I'm working parttime at a tire shop and you're like :04 what's going on that's an extreme example of something that people do is that I find like I hang out with some :09 people and I'm like surprised at how much I like them or vice versa and because the version of who they are :16 online and the version of who they are in real life the real them is there's this huge Connect Now obviously there's :22 like levels of people overthinking things imposter syndrome what will people think of me but talk to me about :28 like how you think about tone because I think neither of us take each other or ourselves very seriously we're :34 constantly talking crap and not in just a silly way but just like it we're not we're not afraid to point fun at :40 ourselves we laugh at each other like talk to me about kind of how tone plays into um standing out online I think that :49 it all roads lead back to that like self-esteem and that comfort thing as well like the I'm pretty dry right and :57 I'm right like that and I speak like that and I am like that right your your :03 online content and your personality they're the same thing right my online content and my personality they're :10 pretty much the same thing yeah right so I think it's like I hate that authenticity word yeah but I think I :16 think it's like turning up as yourself unapologetically and and and speaking the speaking through but speaking the :24 way that you speak yeah because people again have that that :29 desperation to truly see somebody Y and I and it's interesting a client was me :34 messaging me today saying I've got a referral for you and I was like okay cool and and she shared a screenshot and :41 it was someone noticing a shift in her and her content and she said like I can :47 finally see you and it's so good and I've known you and she's like you must be working with James yeah because they :54 you know they're in the in the same world but it's like the ton is I'm finally because I know you I can finally :00 see you and I think we we're desperate as humans we're desperate to connect with people and we're desperate to truly :05 see and not be deceived so when when you truly just turn up in the way that you want to turn up as yeah then that comes :13 through all these different channels that comes through in video that comes through in content that comes through in text yeah and if you turn up as yourself :20 then you can't be you can't be competed with yeah right and I think this is a on :25 on a really practical note it also takes practice so it's like how do you find your voice you just speak a lot and :32 write a lot and then over time you figure that out because I think um it's like with appointment sitting right and :39 I don't really do much of that these days but I respond to messages and one of the things that I find is that people :44 are happy to have a conversation in real life and then it's like they fumble the ball in the DMS because they're like :50 this person said this but if I say this then what are they going to say well I lose the sale and and it's just overing what do I say to get the sale and I'm :57 like be curious about where they are be curious about where they want cuz these people it you working on that it's like :05 the best sell by chat script is curiosity of like being interested in somebody yeah but but my point here is :11 that people just have to do it like so part of what we're saying is that some people are stuck being inauthentic :18 because they're not making the decision to go all in on them yeah and some people are three pieces of content in :23 yeah the answer is a thousand more yeah right to really find your full expression like for me I find that I :29 have a sense of humor off stage in my real life and the moment I tried to bring that on stage in the early days I :34 was trying to write jokes the problem was not my type of humor right so now when I'm funny it's always exactly the :42 same as I am in real life which is in the moment yeah right and so it's just through the repetitions and the practice :48 that I think uh people need to commit to in order to get to that place of like as :54 funny as it sounds it takes practice to be yourself it really does and also if :00 people really want it they've got to understand whether the trade-offs are worth it that I I hear people say a lot :07 like I want to have a coaching or Consulting business but I don't want to put myself out there the only :13 alternative path to that is lots of money for ads right so you either use :18 the energy of connection or use the energy of money mhm like both of them :23 put you out there both of them put messages that resonate with people that they respond to that come towards you so :29 if you'd rather do the path of you know doing the Reps and going organic and um :35 you know publishing content then you've got to put yourself out there if you'd rather do the path of getting ads and putting people through funnels and :41 nurturing them and taking the time to do that then you got to put money in yeah like there there's there's not a third :47 path yeah so make the choice so let's talk about team so firstly team is to Choose Your Own :53 Adventure and that if you sell via calls yeah versus DMS if you do all the coaching yourself or you get a coach :59 that's a variable right I would say we both agree that you should get a virtual assistant y ASAP y if you don't have an :07 assistant you are an assistant as our friend Tony Fraser Jones once told me yeah right so I think like day day one :13 you could find 30 minutes a day of admin to get in a virtual assistant yeah where do you see the pressure come on the most :19 for people typically when scaling is it is it firstly on the sales side or the :25 coaching side yeah so the two the two gaps you see come up first are a skills gap which is like I've run out of ways :31 I've run out of knowledge or ability to do this so I need to go and find somebody to do it or a time or a time :37 one so that generally when people are at the beginning one or both both of those show :44 up and that that's that's pretty challenging to kind of navigate but the first I I agree with the first h VA but :51 then the next tire should be where is the bottleneck right like do you this is :57 the key way to think about it people it's not just like oh the second higher as always is this person here's the :02 perfect dog chat the the where is the bottleneck and where is the bottleneck where that you can step out of and you :09 know and solve the bottleneck through the process of a human or Contracting someone so it's the bottleneck at the front with leads and sales sorry is it :16 at the front with with leads is it in the Middle with sales or is it the end with delivery right and then it's like :22 do you hire a coach or a conci you know you've got a couple of choices there do you hire a saleson a closer to do more :29 to do more reps or do you hire someone to you know get in the DMS run leads run funnels and actually get leads and :36 convert them into prospects yeah so it's like it's a bottleneck analysis as the :41 the first major hire if you like because the virtual assistant is relatively easy to find you might go through two or three but um the biggest thing I see :49 with virtual assistant is the Rel L inexpensive in the world that we're in and people are like I don't have enough :54 work for them to do and you're like like you said the average virtual assistant :00 30 minutes an hour a day you're paying them to sit around for six or seven hours a day if they're full-time dedicated to you yeah but the relative :07 cost of that at you know 20 to 30 bucks a day is very very low yeah so at the :12 beginning people need to accept that someone sitting on the bench and they're under utilizing them but utilize them in :17 the future but your 30 minutes is worth more than their whole day yeah also delegation is a muscle you build it up :23 another skill everything's a skill oh man when I first got started with a virtual assistant I would be doing :28 things that the virtual citiz should be doing even when I had one because I kept forgetting that I could delegate it now :34 I got I I realized two platforms this morning had my old profile pictures I :39 didn't log in and change them it was a voice message hey can you change my uh School Community thing and my cly :46 profile photos to the Facebook one thanks like now it's just like a muscle so um a really helpful framework that I :53 remember learning when I was hiring this and building this stupidly big team was from Ari misel and uh do you know AR's :00 story no so AR runs this uh I don't know what he does now but he used to run something called the replaceable founder :08 and his story was he built this business and then he got Crohn's disease and it got only work 1 hour a day so became like efficiency productivity machine :15 when you're hiring let's say you figure out the bottleneck right so like you look at appointment hitting you're spending too many times and too much :21 time in the DMS you go through this process called o a o optimize automate :28 Outsource right so the key is you optimize first you go is this thing that :34 I'm doing yeah is it important should it be getting done yeah um you know is this :39 a later thing is this now thing all that kind of stuff you filter it through um is there a better way that I can be doing this to make it just as impactful :45 and less time all of that kind of stuff automate oh this is a freaking super important question now in the age of AI :52 cuz now you're having things like copyrighting and video editing and all those things where it previously it was :57 like I need videos edited post a job now it's like there is an AI for that that can take your podcast and edit it up and :04 then Outsource and the the point being your first like response to overwork or :09 overwhelm should not be I'll go hire someone if you're going to hire someone it should be this refined focused super :16 Crystal Clear role your job is this this is how many hours they think it's going to be and I think the mistake that I've :23 made is right now I'm making more profit with a team of two than when I had a :28 team of 13 yeah and so the idea of you just keep adding people in and we'll figure it out on the way or hiring for :34 growth right is typically a stupid model when you actually figure out what the botnick is figure out is it actually a :41 botnick at all or you just going through a busy week then going through o a o o I think is really really key so right now :48 do you have any team at all what one yeah Alex VA right all round VA super :54 superstar cool right now I have a VA and a Content guy what's up sh up um and uh :01 and I'm going to be hiring more people soon because we working with an agency we're really scaling up content um but the point is is that like I wouldn't :07 even need Dylan to stay where I am like if I want to stay where I am I could be right there with a VA as well but the point is is that there's the point is is :14 that there's no set team to get to 100K a month because it depends on your model depends on like I don't run any ads :20 right now right so so it's also not like should I run ads to get to 100K a month it's like what's the bottleneck yeah :26 right and so I think team is much the same the only non-negotiable for me is get an assistant because you should not :32 be adding people on Facebook or responding to a support request or following up a billing like a failed pay :37 payment those are all the things that are Nob brainers for me everything else is up for grabs I have no doubt I could :43 make more money today if I hired an appointment set and a closer I'm unwilling to do that because I have no :50 appetite for that that doesn't allow with my values um I know that if I hired a full-time coach um I could get more :57 clients that way because people love oneone coaching I'm just unwilling to do that so it's a question of values when :03 someone's scaling as well when it's less about the the five person team that is :09 the 100K a month blueprint and it's more about what are your values what are you trying to build how many hours what does :15 it look like what are you unwilling to do what are you willing to do and then what are your constraints and then based on that high :20 the last thing I want to talk about as we wrap up is when you think about going from 10K a month to 100K a month what :28 are the biggest skill leaps and mindset shifts people need to experience in :34 order to go from six figures to seven figures the biggest skill leap is is :41 generally around offer making an articulation which is which is an the :46 the skill of empathy of putting themselves into the marketplace because at the moment they're selling something :51 that people kind of like but if they kind of like their market then they get right in there and and so the biggest :56 thing is the empathy the second the second piece of mindset can be largely solved by proximity like if you're going :03 if you're going these days on a journey that you've never gone before and you're not in an environment with people who :09 have either done that Journey or on it with you then you're a fool because we can buy the we can buy the speed bumps :16 even free like this like we can buy ways over the speed bumps that that far :23 exceed the value of our the the outputs we get far exceed the value of the inputs so I think mindset is solved just :30 by proximity because it changes the belief profile because often when you're if you're sarting out from a from a a :37 leap from 10 to 100K you don't actually believe you can get to 100K right yeah :42 you just think you can and you haven't gone to like I will yeah and when you :47 have the I will piece you can get that through going in a community and you walk around and you go to people you're :53 like they're not any smarter than me they're not even better than I am and then you getting in there and you're :58 like okay the mindset shifts by being around people who are doing it and have a have a higher belief like level than :05 you mindset doesn't change in isolation you you know you can't just wish your way to I'm going to do this I'm going to :13 do this I'm going to do this you can brute force it but you will exhaust yourself along the journey where if you :19 just get proximity then it changes your mindset because it changes your belief patterns yeah I find the only way to :24 really shift beliefs is to borrow bitter ones like like it's either education :29 environment or um our relationships and so I I think like the thing that we have :35 to say on this to anyone who's listening now to help them the most is you and I :41 wouldn't be where we are without mentorship courses being sponges we would say that because we sell that :46 stuff too yeah yeah but but I would I would say it to the extent of like mentorship changed my life pre- business :52 like when I think back to when I was 10 11 12 and wildly lost as as a guy in a :58 really kind of crazy family it was the 18-year-old 19-year-old guys that um :04 were helping me stay on the track and so I don't sell mentorship now cuz it makes money I sell it cuz I believe in it :10 right and you do too ex and I think there's something to be said about the fact that I think people should be :15 self-responsible they shouldn't be looking for uh Co coach as partners right meaning like we're looking for :22 someone to become codependent with us and jump on the trenches and guarantee us results I think that's where we lose :27 our power that's where we get stuck and we get disappointed is because we're looking for someone to step in and say your problems are now my problems that's :33 not how it works but I think we also make a huge mistake where we think like :38 we should be a lone wolf or we're or then we're signing up with a mentor but then we're filtering everything they say through like us Reinventing and :45 innovating everything and I think there's just something to be said about following someone's advice and listening to it and doing it not blindly but but :54 without so many doubts and cynicism and skepticism you know the amount of people that are willing to pay for advice :59 they're not willing to take is wild it's it's crazy it's I see the same I see my :07 role as similar to I see my role with my kids yeah right my kids don't listen to :12 a single word I say but they model pretty much everything I do yeah so I'm :17 either going to be a role model or I'm G to be someone whose actions are completely disconnected from their words :23 and many parents are right they're like get off your phone kids as they glued to the thing yeah and and I and I see the :29 same role that we have with both the people that we Mentor but also our mentors too that the proximity of those :37 things is modeled M and we learn much more by osmosis of modeling than we do by someone telling us what to you know :45 what to do yeah and like candidly like sitting around this table with us and being around us is a hell of a lot :51 better than them watching on YouTube but that's a great proxy for it it's a great it's a great replacement for it until :57 the people on the other side of this can do that so the the proximity and being :02 around people is absolutely crucial I mean we joke about our similar business models and and those kind of things but :08 we've also kept each other on paths and and given each other gifts back and :13 forth of like those kind of things just through proximity of those things I think it's like hilarious and I and I can't even name youve you you named a :20 couple of moments and you said like question that and I was like oh yeah you're right that's just stupid like :25 [ __ ] but most of the time it's just purely through osmosis by by us being in proximity yeah yeah people didn't know :31 how close we were they would think that we're just two dudes just copying each other's things but actually what's :37 happening is we are sharing resources and sharing ideas so we're mentoring each other but most of it's unconscious :43 yeah 100% but but though in saying that the amount of times that we've had conversations where we challenged it I :49 remember coming to you end of last year or started this year and I was like I'm going to let my team go blah blah feel serious blah you're like I've been :54 waiting for this conversation and that's where I think like um people like it's an interesting thing the last thing I'll :00 say on this is um people should obviously lean into the level of access they can afford with the right people :06 there are people that Mentor me that I've never met that don't know I exist like Brook Castillo right I would pay :11 for time with her though I probably couldn't afford it now she's probably like bazillion dollars I have felt :16 mentored by her and she has shifted my thinking through her content yeah but people should pay for the level of :22 access that they can afford good because when you are in proximity with someone :28 there is something so much more powerful than being on the outskirts of like you :33 know buying a course is not the same as having a coffee even though the course :39 might have more information than the coffee of a will proximity right we used to say in like church culture with like :44 leadership more is caught than taught yeah right so it's like yes you can sit down and take the notes but sometimes :50 it's just in and around being in someone's environment in someone's proximity or someone's Community just paying for that level of access that you :56 can afford is one of the fastest shortcuts last thing I'm going to say on mind uh mindset and mind shifting is you :04 want to think about it like hiring which is soul for the bottleneck yeah you don't need like I don't need motivation :10 so like I binged grant card own and ID my lead and Lewis house and all those guys when I was getting started because I need motivation I need like the you :17 can do it I'm good man I feel amazing I feel fired up I feel full of vision so :23 I'm not binging personal development stuff these days and that's not to say I won't again yeah the season but it's :29 knowing what I need in the specific season and then thinking about it like a medicine cabinet right not just going I :36 should be reading a book A Week why yeah what am I reading on like what is this about so people becoming self-aware :42 enough to know like what's the deficit is the deficit in my soul is it in my emotions and my character traits is it in my mindset or is it in my business :48 skills and solving for those skills through getting the right mentorship or exposure to education environments is :55 the real unlock to scaling really fast definitely yeah that was a real right there yeah um I just want to thank you :01 so much for taking the time dude um this is always a joy and we've been going for 2 hours and 10 minutes I think oh I'm :07 going to be L to Pilates I'm I'm about to wet my pants so I appreciate you brother I love you so much and I love :13 doing this journey with you oh that that was way too that was way wider than I thought it's it's the wide angle all :19 right thanks man thanks man

Ex-$120M Director Now Makes More Money Working 2 Days a Week as a Consultant (James Kemp Interview)

there are certain things that you can give and get that enrich your life in ways that you didn't appreciate a lot of

people say they're building a business but what they actually want is enough cash flow to live a great life the way

to get clients is by not needing clients getting things is useful to prove or

disprove whether those things enrich your life Consulting is telling people how to do something and then the modern

pilant of Consulting it's doing it with them so your traces of knowledge are left after you stop Consulting how's it Hello James!

going everybody welcome back to another interview honored to be joined by the James Kemp today uh all the way from

Bali Indonesia James thanks for coming on man hey man good to see you good to be seen um so I found you I think about

a year ago and I actually found the post that that like was like oh wait this is

different and you were talking about actually I have it here I want to read it um because you know like I get

connected with a lot of random people on Facebook and it's the usual driil but

this this stood out to me in that I was like oh wait this is like actually inside fall uh I stuck my desk in the up

position I can't sit down even if I want to I do my best work standing up I could

sit down when your life is integrated the sitting down time bleeds into the other time I can hear them in the other

room I like hearing the patter they call out asking me to play keeping my desk in the the up position means I have to

choose the highest leverage tasks other otherwise I would be standing here all day I create that environment that is

productive and present for me and the people I serve so I can create an environment that is enriching and present for them the more days I spend

on the earth the more I appreciate the little things the little hinges That Swing on bigger doors I'm on standing

here riding this so I can be on for them uh and my my baby was like not born

yet but he was like three months it was like three months until the due date and I was like man there's so much to be said and your

your school bio is the Lord of Leverage so I think it it fits along well and um

it's a mindset that I've um really like done my best to adopt from you as we've

worked together and I've consumed a lot of your stuff so excited to dive into that today because it's it's just not

talked about enough and the The Leverage piece is the difference between

honestly like living or dying in the online space sometimes yeah yeah thank

you thank you for two reasons thank you for sharing the moments because when I when I write or create I you know I

create for myself first and one person second and thank you for sharing that while I'm sitting down which just makes

it oh we'll talk about of James camp but Saturday morning so

and yeah okay so give us like five minutes on you uh you

started way I mean you're from New Zealand but you started kind of your your business journey in the UK right

yeah my entrepreneurship Journey um you know started just over two decades ago

uh so I'm dating myself and aging myself uh pretty quickly so um well came from a

sales the sales world you know worked for Kind of Blue Chips BMW um Xerox and

and some of the Blue Chips I came from a sales background and gone into finance and uh and started my own finance

company uh where I was you know selling selling Financial leads uh door Todo uh

and then I found this thing called Google and WordPress and started to realize that maybe it was easier to uh

you know work with your fingers uh rather than knock on a thousand doors a day on counsil States and uh in the

English winter um so did some reps on the door knocking and then and then was

selftaught in terms of generating leads that I sold to finance companies uh unfortunately finance companies stopped

buying leads um you know during a a financial crisis and I had to go and get a job um and went went into the tech

sector and uh long story short over five years um started as a salesperson and work my way up to um marketing director

of $120 million business where essentially we were we were a group on clone down down there in New Zealand um

and accumulated that time you know the itch to get back into into entrepreneurship and take the skills

that I'd both built myself but also built in you know um in high volume sales and online sales environments back

into helping people do it and then uh you know took the traditional coaching

Consulting route uh learned from the best and adapted you know a lot of those ideas for myself uh and then really um

you know learn in in the mix you know did did what I

taught what I did and and um and did what I taught uh and you know the last

the last few years especially have been the realization that you know once you've got a set of skills once you've

got a basic skill um that it's there's a lot of things to chase there's a lot of shiny objects to chase but um we have

the great privilege nowadays of choosing to build a business around our life

rather than our life run a a business and you know in my younger days um it was all about hitting the numbers and

and getting the targets uh and these days it's about having something that I do that fits my skill set that that that

ultimately feeds my life rather than the other way around yeah I think that's your like you

have the skills and the mindset of uh let's say or horoi or Sam ovens

but you choose to play in this some people would call small game but yeah

you know you know two to three million a year trying to get to 10 with a a tiny

team and only doing calls two days a week is your current goal correct me if

I'm wrong yeah yeah hey guys just jumping in here to give you a quick word on our sponsor high level before we get GHL!

instructions for that are also at it's t.com slm Mastermind and Gunning for the $150mil business

um I think there's more people that need to admit that to themselves that like

that's all they really want I've heard you allude that to that the past like you talk to clients and

they're like they're embarrassed about their real income goals because they feel it's too small yeah yeah tell us

about that how did you like were you gunning for 10 I mean you are gunning for 10

million year now but with very very small constraints on that but were you

gunning for the the big $150 million business and all the employees and that

eventually and how did that fall apart and and eventually reconstruct into your current goals I didn't know what I was

gunning for um I was gunning for something that that that gave me meaning and and got me recognition and like

brushed the chip on my shoulder that I've you know of the small boy who was never seen um so I was chasing I was

chasing goals because it because number on numbers on the scoreboard you know for a long time correlated some sense of

meaning for me um and then in in the time I you know I was married and I and

I built a family uh and then when that came along it shifted the sense of meaning so you know at at at at the peak

if you like of you know a traditional model you know I had a team of 14 and you know we we were doing just under

three million year at you know okay margins um you know and built up the traditional model but um it was all

consuming and you know the next up level of skill acquisition of management of

hiring of people development um I realized would take me away from my call which was um having fun and making cool

with cool people um so the the the game was on you know and I've and I've

got a big skill base to go wherever I want to go um with those skills and you know I've had teams of 25 people and you

know in the middle of you know nine figure businesses um so the game was on to to keep growing and keep scaling uh

until you know life made me realized that there was life going on that was outside the computer screen and outside

the the the the 9 to8 you know kind of hours um and there were skills I didn't

want to didn't want to develop was it having kids that made you realize that

yeah yeah and um yeah you said that there skills I didn't want to Honing skillset and mindset

develop did you have any one in your circle that kind of you feel frowned

upon you or tried to convince you to go to the next level or was there their respect for knowing what you wanted I

still do I think um there's I the choices I've made especially in the last

24 months um you know a lot of my friends have large businesses a lot of

my friends have large teams and a lot of my friends have you know secret struggles that they don't want to share

with people because they they they sell that model um and you know privately um they say to

me they're jealous um but you know they also I'm not I'm not looking to

invalidate anybody's idea of what a business is and or or what life is um I'm just saying there's a choice about

how we build it and we have to be deliberate to to decide the the things that are important to us you know when

um I started working with you um I allow places to put truth on the table what do

you actually want because we're all in these we're all in these environments where a lot of people are trying to self

validate the thing that everybody else wants and they're like it's kind of like that Spider-Man meme of like do you you

want this he you want this and everyone's pointing at each other going yeah you want this big agency with this huge team and you want the you know

those things and then everybody's quietly turning around whispering and going this sucks the responsibility the

expectations the margins the work the chase this sucks there must be a better way and you know I give permission Miss

for people not to build businesses because very very few people actually want a business and all the

things that are associated with it you know and until you've been inside these big machines where you can lose yourself

you don't really appreciate what that means and a lot of people say they're building a business but what they

actually want is enough cash flow to live a great life and spend time with the people that are important to them um

you know and do the things they want to do whatever that may be and you know if we break down all the things of my model

and my philosophy and those things it's that what do you want here's some tools

that I've got that can help you get there you know and I have clients with sales teams I have clients with Setters

and closers I have clients who deliver agency services and have done for you and I don't judge a single piece of that

I just give them a leverage to ensure that they're doing the things that they want to be doing with the people they

want to be doing it with and rewarded adequately for that The Art of Time Management

yeah so much there um would you

say the like you work quote unquote work two days a week meaning Cent work two

days a week I work a lot including in my head yeah yeah um you work in your head

yeah on the other other times but you are talking to clients two days a week would you say that the time talking

with the clients you see as like a necessary part of like hey I'm

selling Consulting so this has to happen at some point or and or does that feel

like the art to you and what parts of what you do do you enjoy the most uh all of it because um I see business as a

creative game with a scoreboard right this thing we call business and essentially the most

effective long- lasting businesses institutions movements Etc are are kind of rooted in ritual and

creativity and you know and and freshness and newness of old things you

know whether it's politics or religion or business it it all or art it all kind of manifests in the same way so my goal

with clients is to give them the tools that I've accumulated give them the insight about how they worked for me and

then help them understand how they might work for them so they can go off and run at themselves and we can both learn

something because they're not learning something from an application of and the

delivery of a client then it's not interesting to me so I am

um infinitely curious rather than trying to gatekeep anything you know um I'll use you as an

example if I may um yeah I'm not on YouTube I don't know much about YouTube

in terms of an organic strategy um I've seen it I've worked with people who have

giant YouTube channels I work with people who spent you know $55 million a month on YouTube ads I've seen it all

but I don't participate in it so I'm infinitely curious about when I help you build a community and start to build

some you know coaching and Consulting offers in these pieces how you apply those to your world because if I can see

the insights and they bring them into my world that makes me better and the the increase in my skill and the deployment

of that skill and the more I'm prepared to let it go then makes you better and we're in a happy cycle

so I don't see any of it as work I just see it as art and then the science bit

the art is the creativity and the deployment of it and letting go of the ideas you know and that's been a that's

been a two decade long mantra for me of just letting go of ideas um giving them to people so we can multiply them they

can multiply them and faith in the and trust in you know whoever you believe in

uh on that spiritual level that the universe will will return that favor and and work in all our favores so I'm

always looking for what ideas can I give people and put out there um and then how can they how can they develop ideas

because it if it makes if you do well with my ideas I do well from the insights that you gain from those and we

all do well together yeah what a worldview like wake up in the morning and it's not

about how can I pad the bank account it's about how can I share and multiply

ideas with cool people that I like hang out with would is that a fair characterization definitely definitely

and and it's from um obviously it's from a place of you know to break the seal on

that you have to trust that the Universe has you back but now it's from a place of deep Financial Comfort strong

stability you know financially and mentally so it's easy for me to say these things um but it it it it had to

start from a place of if I let let my ideas go and put them out there um then

I be rewarded and the less expectation I had around that and the less pressure

and need I had for that it's funny that the more I was rewarded for that you know over the long term in the in the

financial scoreboard that that that does matter um but can also be blinding when you're trying to manipulate it in the

short term lots of people are chasing short-term results where if they allowed those results to happen um then their

long-term results would be would be infinitely better than they seemen to you know today tomorrow yeah it's so Measuring a different kind of success

interesting um so sorry this is a bit of an inflection point um but it just to

relate back to what we're saying and then transition to the next point I read this in one of your posts recently as

well as a mentoring coach I'd love to hand over the exact stepbystep template to success it doesn't exist we all

measure success differently I assembled mine your path can be assembled too

that's the the lie that's being sold is the opposite of that that you need to want

the lambo you need to want the big house um and the the refreshing breath of air

air from you and others like you is that that hey like let's just figure it out

it may be something different than you're being told it's useful to get the things I hate shs so let's talk in utility it's

ful to get the things to to then validate or invalidate the idea of how how important those things are right

yeah when I bought $153,000 SUV that I'd coveted and watched the

YouTube reviews of and watched people drive and had the wonderful engine sound

I did it so four months later I could prove to myself that that didn't actually make me any happier and it

actually introduced a level of um stress in my life that was was not pressure and was unwelcome

right I bought the super expensive watch to wear it around to be then too scared

to wear it in public because it it's too expensive and it's too valuable and I might scratch it so now it sits in a box

in the safe yeah right so it is useful to chase things to to then prove or

disprove whether those things give you any kind of validation or meaning or or

what they mean because some of them do there are certain things that you can give and get um that that that enrich

your life in ways that you didn't didn't appreciate I I live in a pretty like

oversized large Villa in in B right and

I always said I don't need something that big and that fancy it's excessive it's too much we've got space in like

this office I'm in the corner of and I there's just the this massive room in front of me because I've got all the

space right and then when I started inviting people over and I bought clients over and we sat down and I and I

and I built an environment where I saw people have breakthroughs that they'd never had had in any other ways and then

I'm expanding my family now uh a puppies you know puppies included it um to to to

enrich this space but for a long time I said I didn't need it I didn't want it

and you know all kinds of levels of cope you know depending on you know what attitude I had on the particular day so

getting things is useful to prove or disprove whether those things enrich

your life because you may be surprised when you um hit certain goals or get

certain things in your life um what they actually lead to and what they actually mean to got

it uh it reminds me of another one of your posts where you maybe you can provide some more context on this but

you were talking about how hilar how hilarious it is to see these like 20s

something in monk mode just like head down doing nothing not spending any of their money and you're like it's going

to manifest itself as this crazy midlife crisis at 50 like you might as well buy the lambo now dude figure out you don't

want it either way it's going to be fun to watch but their C and hooker era is going to be

epic because it's it's just bottling up energy and saying that you can Channel

it in one way and that will get you to the goal you know what and there's enough truth in that for certain number

of people for it not to be disproven but for many people these these ideas are um

inherently bottling up energy that could be used in in much more productive ways

yeah so would you say the wanting of the material item um like there's some people who

would say don't let that drive you you have to find your why etc

etc but you and I both know that why can be more elusive than we want it to be

sometimes yeah what would you like those are temporary goal posts that

you're okay with being like I'm doing this right now to get the next material thing and then that will teach me a

little bit more about what I don't want and what I do want yeah do stuff like get

rich and then see how you feel right yeah and this is the same philosophy

with with any kind of any kind of growth you know I knocked on um hundreds of

doors every day when I was doing door-to-door selling right because behind each door was a the opportunity

for the sale right yeah and life is exactly the same life is exactly the

same do things work out what those things mean to you and then either do more of them

or stop doing them right and that's an oversimplification of a you know a very

simple philosophy but I just believe life is simple do

stuff see how it makes you feel what results did you get and then stop it or

do more of it and I think especially in societies where there's a lot of high IQ

people or you know and a lot of people professing emotional intelligence a lot of people just get

stuck in their head about what success might look like and then they abstract that by looking at how someone else does

it or I don't want to Lambo because I saw a guy who's got a Lambo and he's an right you know I don't want to

move to B because I saw someone go there and they you know they got a sore tummy

right so they we approximate someone else's experience with ours so it stops

people doing stuff and this is the this is the amazing Paradox I see nowadays it's like never been easier to start

something and it's never been easier to to get rich by just from your ideas yet

less and less people are starting because they're worried about what the future might look like if they do those things because they're living through

other people because they've got that shoved in their face through social media every single day and they go well

if I do that then this is going to happen it's like you don't know just do stuff yeah do more stuff make more

offers take more risks do more things while you can and then learn we only learn by

doing yeah such a good point um so you listed that you wanted today Who do you need to be, to be successful?

to talk about who do you need to be successful who sorry who do you need to

be to be successful online I glad I reread it because I was

thinking it's what do you need to do to be successful online but that differentiation of who

do you need to be is is huge um and I want to give you plenty of time to talk

about it but I want to ask this question first what would you say in terms of like

Financial Security what were the levels for you where different levels of abundance or

just being able to like breathe and look around and kind of focus on this

becoming mind frame when did that unlock for you um obviously it would be amazing

if everyone could unlock that earlier and I think they'd ironically progress faster if they could do it out of

abundance instead of out of need but uh yeah talk about your own Journey there

and then let's dive into the the journeys of what other people might look like yeah I think each

step of the journey if I reflect back whether it was um from job to entrepreneurship back to job back to

entrepreneurship was essentially um finding replacement value as I call it

so um I work with a lot of people who are kind of have the Golden Hand s like

they're coming out of a particular place where they're making good money but they feel trapped in it so we work on

replacing that level of income with an income that they actually love doing and

a much higher effective value rate because they have multiples of Leverage so rather than earning 150 Grand a year

as a you know as a as a VP um you're earning 150 Grand a year you know as a

consultant and you're working 85% less right so for me it was the the the

levels of abundance were matching the income of the previous thing of the

previous step but getting more time back and that allowed me to be them more creative to

take the next step and a lot of people chase the income increase rather than

chase the time increase and the times where all the magic happens the times where all the creativity the unique

uness the development the building actually happens but people are focused

on the work because they directly correlate the work with getting the income right yeah so for for me I was

coming from you know what was I on when I left grb one about 160 Grand basic

plus bits and pieces so say it was 200k by the end of the year right I had to

walk in to Consulting gigs that paid me at least that but I could get those

Consulting gigs and I could do them in a day and a half a week so I went from a 60h hour a week

marketing director with all the responsibility in the world because it was a 247 operation you know daily deals

was that um it is that um into a into a place where I could do that and then I

could have the time to build it and so in the in the each step

up as long as the lifestyle didn't expand and it did to to you know fill

the void of um of of surplus in the income then I was always just looking

for how can I get more time back how can I get more time back but yeah for the

vast majority of people they are comfortable right where

they are now at that 10,000 is a month

is the is the comfort is the comfort level and then the desire kicks in

because then there's then it's all about the individual being perpetually dissatisfied

and the I'll I'll tell you where I sit now

um I'm on a run rate of 3 million just over 3 million a year right I haven't

had a full year where I've done three million but I'm ahead of that run rate and by the end of the financial year I

would have yielded over 3 million out of this this current business at 90 plus% profit

margins yeah my reach to 10 million is not through need I have Financial

abundance I have vehicles where I investing that money and where it's going and I know the purpose of it it's

to play the game more and to stretch the scoreboard so as I said here now I don't

need more than that but I desire it because I want to work out how to do it under the constraints that I've got and

I can clearly see the path to about five and a half million with the current product Suite what I do now with very

little alteration and just optimization I can't see the path but you know candid I can't see the path beyond that the the

the technology the The Leverage and those things will come to me and I have no I have no timeline and I have no goal

on that so for me it's always been about replacement putting the time and getting

the time back and then then understanding where that time goes to to to then take the stretch and go yeah

what's next where where do I really want to go you know and um like honestly

especially there was a four-month period this year um you know we're seven months into the year there's a four-month

period this year where the season was Cruise right just Cruise um growth

pushing scaling it was not just wasn't feeling it and you know that's a

privilege to be at when you've got hundreds of thousands of dollars coming in every month um but it's also you know

paying attention to what season you're in yeah oh just Feeling left behind

the it goes back to the worldview of I'm just here finding and multiplying ideas

and when I wake up one day and I'm not feeling the growth or whatever I just

like because your model is very much dependent on you because you have very little team members the business kind of

has to grow with you comma and that's okay like it has to grow when you're feeling good and it has

to cruise when you're feeling like cruising um is there ever still that sense of

like I'm I'm getting behind does that creep in or do you like have you learned

to stve that off oh yeah okay and the more you fill your world with like super

smart clients and super smart friends the more you'll you'll you'll feel like

I'm missing something here like you know I feel behind the curve on YouTube I

feel behind the curve on AI I feel behind the curve and then you know I

just tap up smart people and go what am I missing here like what can I see what what can you see that I can't see and

what do you what do you think I should be doing and just be you know I don't know what I'm talking about so like I've got an idea and I know how

these principles apply and I I work from principles but how does how does that layer over so yeah I always feel behind

and I always feel feel a certain level of dissatisfied but then you know I check in with myself on the daily on a

on a daily basis about what I'm doing who I'm doing it with and and why I'm doing it to ensure that I'm actually in

the driver's seat of my life rather than um than living someone else's life because I've convinced myself there are

there are there are better things out there because there's lots of good ideas out there and there's lots of very very

convincing people telling you that their idea is the best right and they've got

you know you know we have all got very good at this myself included um you know

I have convinced if you like many people that are you know a one person Consulting business is you know the

panace and definitely the future and for for for many people that's correct and and and for some it's not

yeah yeah I think like your motto when I started with it I was like this fixes

every problem like it's amazing and then you get a few months into it and you're like okay there's some drawbacks yeah

okay what's this um but I I was just talking to my wife so can I ask can I Dials to tweak

ask you a question about that yeah do you know what dials to tweak within within it now you've got it going well

for me it's been a little weird because without trying the affiliate income has gone to a point where I never dreamed it

would be yeah and it's just faster easier less effort like the most

leverage thing I could do and it's recurring and so I'm like what does the I enjoy the oneon-one

but also there's part of it that's just a grind for me and so I I'm also in Cruise mode where I'm like can I just

back up and but I'm what I took from you and I'm

still taking is like there's your Consulting model or

your your agency model whatever it is like literally is completely up to you

um so your thing about like stop de like uh or stop

demonizing selling your time like if you're selling your time for a th an

hour like that's a great effective rate just sell like a 100 hours a year

$100,000 if you have some saved like you can have a a really amazing life with

very few work hours and like why would anyone do humanized that so that for me

is like I do enjoy oneon-one but I I was getting I think caught up in too much

like too many beginner conversations where I wasn't enjoying the monotony of it yeah and so

I'm I'm kind of recalibrating and figuring out like how how much of the beginner conversations I want to be

having versus the the higher level like hey let's let's take this from 50k to

100K instead of let's take this from Zer to five sure yeah yeah uh one of the one

of the ways I look at that and this may be useful to you is is is can I do I want to stop having these conversations

or do I want to change the Forum that I have them in right so for me um beginner

conversations um are much more useful in group environments where I can teach

teach by demonstration through an example because the distribution of that idea is far more leverag because if

there's 40 people on the call and they all take something away from me working with one person then the amplification

of that is both more valuable to that individual but also the people who are there so therefore the amplification of

that and the satisfaction that I get is much higher I'll have begning conversations all all day long but one

of my clients who has 52 million a year I ain't dropping them in a group and saying what are your current problems

and you know how are your 44 team members operating today and you know what are the numbers and are the kpis we

do that via WhatsApp and and jump on a call when we need to because he needs me

when he needs me and the availability of that is as is proof of value so so for

me I go through Seasons where I don't want to speak to people oneon-one and usually if on reflection it's

accumulated um stress of letting people too close to have the same repetitive questions and there was no feedback loop

of energy to say okay I've had this I've had this conversation five times this

week and I'm fatigued but because I'm not getting anything back from it but high level problems or um you know

expensive problems are much more satisfying to solve because then the the amplification of those problems is much

more satisfying and and oh yeah we got back and um you know one tweak and a

client's offer you know made them an extra 1.1 million and you're like that's cool like solving problems at scale that

didn't happen in a group call and a you know and a and a school group uh it happened you know on a on a phone call

then a follow-up you know a follow-up Zoom where you know we're pushing things around and writing words so for me I'm

always looking to change the the the modality um and understand why I'm in that place where I'm I'm not enjoying

something because the energy is not there yeah exactly and I think

that's it's it's seeing the result for me that makes it worth it yeah and so

that's like oneoff calls I had a ton of those when I first started out was just like oneoff call and then I literally never hear from the person again I was

like that was not worth the money that I got paid for that because I I need to know the outcome even if it's bad or

whatever like this person they just never report back and obviously you can you can reach out to them and usually get a report um and I love those ones

like I I ran into somebody last week just at a like local Meetup he's like dude we did a Consulting call like four

years ago I was like oh really like was it any good and he was like yeah I'm doing you know 30k a month now or

whatever and I'm like oh that's awesome like I wish I I knew more of those

stories and so for me I'm I'm sort of like I don't I don't want to be on all

the time and have to be forced into calls at a specific time or responding

within a a certain time frame so I'm trying to figure out is it just like a season of the year where I do that

because it's fine for a while or is it more like taking equity in a few businesses and like really being on the

front row seat of like what the Consulting that I'm doing is is changing for them um but I'm luckily in a in a

position where the i' you know again The Accidental affiliate income has has

gotten to a point where I've it's opening up my abundance and mindset so much that I can take that time that you

were talking about and just take the sabatical figure out what's next type of thing yeah yeah we

we we learn through contrast right and what what your journey is helping you see is the value and the affiliate

income which helps you define it and put it in a place where you define it and how much work and effort you want to do

to grow it or maintain it or or whatever your decisions are yeah and then to to

put yourself in places of contrast to say okay I'm coaching these two people

oneon-one one-on-one is the consistent thing the the same modality the variable as the

people this person enjoying working with this person I'm

not they've both got the same thing but they're different people and you know I I was I was defining this on on a I have

a Syndicate group who get calls with me twice a week around that these

businesses are offer driven but human powerered I I can show someone how to make the best offer in the world from

her it's easy to sell B but the the the L the

the effect of that offer in terms of the delivery of it the stress the energy

whatever it is and and subsequently the how long it's going to last selling easily and being fun to run Etc depends

on the humans you put in it and in the knowledge economy that's pretty much defines almost everything you know if we

make good offers people will buy them if we work with quote unquote bad people

which is just a people who aren't optimal for us then those offers won't last and sustain and they won't give you

the results you want and so many people will blame the offer rather than their their decisions in their commitments and

their participation around it it's easy to get people to buy stuff but even if I

called a 100 people today and offered them a thousand bucks on the phone you wouldn't have 100% close rate that's

true um and it sort of reminds me and maybe

this is just me realizing this in 2024 but I feel like

2024 is the lead of or the the year of the quality lead like look I don't care

about how many come through I care about how many actually have the money I don't have to arm wrestle into a sale like I'm

just I'm too old for this type of thing is like what I'm hearing for most people

even if they're not old um and that that plays out on the other side obviously

with how difficult they are to manage or how much ener they energy they drain

Etc who who do you have to become to be the person or how do you attract the the Attracting Quality Leads

quality leads and the quality customers um even if you're a

beginner there's two levels to this the first the first level of solving old

problems new ways right and so the first the first level is old problems new ways

just means there's certain things that aren't going away people will always

want to look better naked businesses will always want more leads more sales

More Money More Revenue more profit better team members

Etc so all a lot of people are trying to solve new problems in new ways and no

one understands what the heck they're talking about right right so look at old

problems what problems that can be solved and what desires are in a

Marketplace that you a category that you have permission to play in as in markets

are built inside out you know I came from an e-commerce world and so my first

clients were e-commerce because I could talk the talk walk the walk I could I could build inside out because I had

market knowledge I knew participants I could speak the lingo and I knew what I was talking about so which which old

problem can you solve in a new way in a category that you got permission to play in right and permission to play in might

just be going into that category and and busting in the door and getting your first person to actually solve a problem for an end deploy Skill New Way means

I've got a unique mechanism that sits over the top of the Sol problem and I'm solving it and that's how I'm going to

get your interest right and so owning and branding your unique mechanism um is

really critical because it differentiates you in a in a commoditized market because lots of people are trying to solve those

problems but when you combine those two things together you get a m a multiplication effect a Compound Effect

that's much bigger than one plus one if you help people lose weight but you've got a new mechanism to do it you know

combining the the the the old the old problem with the new way will get you far more attention a far more buying a

far more um application of those people because humans need humans have based

desires but they also need stimulation and they need newness and they need um you know certain levels of dopamine or

something new in terms of doing it so they need new ways to to try and solve those problems um the second level is is

the way to get clients is by not needing clients the way to get money is by not needing it because you you're you're

fulfilling your own needs first and you're in a place where you don't need

anything from anybody and the closer you can get to that state

the more that that will flow in because you've got capacity for it and in the

world of Commerce the the the pushiest most aggressive sales people tend to make the

most to tend to make the least sales because they project the mo the most

need and need doesn't flow to where it's deserved it flows to where there's

capacity for it so if someone feels like that the only reason you're doing something is because you need the money

they're unlikely to give you that money but if someone feels like you're doing this because you love it and you care

about them and you and and that the result is the only thing that matters then the money is just the the transfer

you know of that of that same energy and if you if you remove the need in

yourself for validation through money through clients through being seen as the the the smartest bastard in the room

then you'll find that that that power is actually accumulated indirectly by giving it away and allowing other people

to have theirs and your power is is is the fact that you don't need any of it you don't need you don't need any

particular person to make you feel whole and complete on that particular day yeah it's so true I was talking to a friend

earlier today about how I I don't even see what I do as a business anymore like

there's no there's no ego wrapped up in it I'm not like I'm an entrepreneur that chip on your shoulder you talked about

I'm like I just found some money glitch on the internet and it happens to be working out for me and that feels

infinitely more powerful than having to parade around like I know what I'm doing

there's a beautiful gratitude wrapped up on that right that I was

um you know that that that idea that you know I was given this opportunity and um

that the that everything's working in my favor and here I am and it's meant to be

and there's there's a beautiful gratitude in that which just says I'm the luckiest bugger on Earth because I

get to I get to do this and this is happening for me yeah yeah it's so

true um so along those lines I feel like a lot

of beginners who we may have lost already at this point in the conversation but even a lot of advanced

people all they talk about is revenue revenue revenue like hey I can help you make

more money yeah um and going to that the quality lead Offer Creation

conversation something I've learned from you is the the right people have

specific problems that the wrong people don't have and specific desires that the

the the wrong people don't have um for example I was working with a client in

the orthodontic space and he was saying how his orthodontist that he loved the

most that was like the most qualified and just closed the most people and had grown like 2x since they started working

together on his Facebook ads was he had gotten more efficient over his 30 years

of being an orthodontist and therefore he was able to take on more

patience and I was like that's the perfect hook for an ad are you an experienced orthodontist with that has

gotten more efficient over the years and um you want to fill fill the spot so

that you're getting as much leverage as possible for the days you're spending in the clinic let's lead into

that but on your end I feel like I I feel like you've given me

permission and others permission to be like yeah I don't have to be thinking about business doing business having my

ego wrapped up into my business 247 in fact it's better if I don't um

and arguably a more powerful desire for that right person the the orthodontist

with 30 years of experience for example is here's how to spend more time with your family not here's how to make more

money um it reminds me of another hook I heard years ago that was like don't sell

the dentist Facebook ads ask the dentist like you got to talk to the dentist about why the hell they became a dentist

and like talk to them about how to get out of that because they're probably miserable

like even though you may not be selling bizops to dentists you need there

there's a lot of people that need a different approach or or need to be

pitched in a different way does that make sense yeah so the thing I talk about is currencies right and so there's

there's predominantly in an offer creation like three pretty simple currencies one of them is

the is almost infinite and two of them are measurable so there's just money you know in bizop and business coaching and

even an agency World um it's you are selling money right you give me $2,000 a

month to run your Facebook ads and build your funnel and I'm going to give you $20,000 a month worth of business bag

right it's just money Arbitrage you give me small amount I give you big amount is the is the is the promise

um then there's a Time factor which like Le also leads the energy factor is that at a certain time

people have a feeling of enough in terms of the money category and they feel like

they can move to a Time category that they want time back but what they're really doing is wanting energy back so

my um and I don't like any of the language that we

all use around low and high level and good and bad clients

and people because I don't my my findings is none of those

things really exist they're just perspective at a certain place at a certain time with with a particular individual but they're useful in the

designation of this but high high level people want energy back more than anything right because we have a finite

life and we understand we have a a certain amount of energy um life force energy and we have a certain amount of

time time to use it and we want to use it to the best of the abil of our abilities and then we have meaning

around the things that we use our energy for ourselves our family and and these pieces so the selling of energy is you

know to that um to that orthodontist we just need to give them ways to measure it right ways to measure energy is um

you've been you've been in business for 20 years um and it used to take you it used to take you five days to to serve

40 patent 40 patients in the chair um and now you can do that in two um and

then it gives them and say and then you can spend the other three days playing golf with your family you know and and

planning your retirement out and I'll help you plan your retirement out and an exit for your orthodontic business and

um you know and how to have enough cash flow for the for the rest of your life and so you can have intergenerational

wealth um that you pass down to your children and your grandchildren right and then they can start then they're

starting to build a picture of okay I'm going to use my effort and that

I've put in over the last 20 and that competence that I've built by being able to serve 40 patients in half the time

into the things that matter to me and you paint a picture of that and that's what copy that's what copywriting does right it just allows us to paint a

picture of the future that doesn't exist yet for someone and then allowing them to be Rel um make it relevant to

themselves so the the the low level you know the the surface level is is selling

money um you know the secondary level is is is selling time to some degree um and

the infinite game is is is is being in in the market to sell energy and then using the modalities that we have to to

do that and you know in terms of service and delivery there's there's only really

you know four and you just mix those modalities based on your Skool

set four modalities to sell energy you mean four modal to serve so we've got

coaching Consulting mentorship um and Service delivery right and Service delivery is just I'll do this thing for

you and it it is nothing else I I'll do this thing for you I will spend $110,000

a month on Facebook ads for you to this funnel and this will happen you will

have leads in your calendar and you call them on the telephone right yeah and it and it kind of ends there we wrap a lot

of stuff around it but service delivery is just doing something for somebody uh mentorship mentorship is this is how I

would do it so my high level mentorship is people asking me how I think about

things and how I've done things in the past that have got success that they want to replicate and I say this is how

I do it this is how I think about it Consulting is telling people how to do

something and then in the modern pance of consult Consulting is it's doing it

with them so your traces of knowledge are left after you stop Consulting your

system your ideas your philosophy is left there because you've done it with them and it's been embedded in the in

the business got it and coaching has helped someone see that they've already got the things inside them to do the

required action um help someone see and give them Insight enough to actually get them to do the thing that they need to

do that they're telling you that that we ultimately move them forward and we

switch between those modalities naturally like a lot of agencies do a ton of Consulting but they don't get

paid for it you know and that's a gigantic opportunity for almost every agency to have a Consulting level in

their business that just does Consulting you know and actually monetizes it because it's very high margin and high

value work and business um and so people are unconsciously do change between

those modalities when they they're being a coach or even being an agency owner or being a consultant but those modalities

when you actually understand the the what they are and how to deploy them that it opens up a world of opportunity

about how you can actually use them either as individual products um sell them as individual products but also

serve people better in that time you know you've been on my on my group calls um you know with folks and I and I ask

permission to consult to them like if I've got time and space I'll coach someone because that will leave the

longest lasting Legacy because they they'll be able to do it themselves if we don't have time and they and they're

floundering around as like can I just consult you and tell you the answer and you going and do it and 99 times out of

100 they say yes right because they're looking to they're looking for the the life raft out of it but when you use

these modalities you can serve people a lot better but in the process of that you serve yourself a lot

better you serve yourself a lot better is that what you said yeah because Serving yourself

you're because why why are you serving yourself better with those modalities because you're setting the correct

expectations you know and life and a and a and a human world is about

expectations and if you don't if you if you coach someone to do something but

you're actually telling them what they want and what to do and you think you're coaching them

but you're actually Consulting to them you're setting an expectation that this thing is going to be right for them

rather than allowing to discover it themselves and that will Downstream have an effect on their application of that

piece their um their their results from it and ultimately their desire to

continue it a lot of people have told a lot of people to do things in the in the hope that it was in their best interests

that turned out to be damaging and if you correct if you set their correct expectations with people

and yourself then everybody is clean and clear going forward and there's no

overhang into areas that that can you know then then blow back to um blow back

in either party's lives got it it's uh I think a big theme

of you in general is like self-confrontation and self- honesty like you lie to

yourself you'll lie to your clients you'll lie to everyone around you and there's you're always going to be living

with that cognitive dissonance until you have to face the music one day and realize that it's been you the bowling

ball crashing down everything in its way yeah that

that's that's the benefit that I have of being old right I'm a I'm an old man in a young

man's game you know in sense of that that I can I can see what's coming because I've been there you know and and

those pieces and I and I provide a huge amount of value to people in my world because of that because I I can see Over

the Horizon because I've already I've already stepped over there and there will be monsters um and I can tell you

not to go for that one but maybe we can guide you towards this one which might be preferable so how does somebody get

to the point of being able to solve the the energy problems

like the what I have in my mind is the agency owner that's saying you know make

give me little money I give you big money but there's a big asteris there which is you have to work 10 more hours

a week to get this next level of money and once the client realizes that they

quickly cancel because they don't want to sift through all the the bad leads etc etc yeah they didn't realize all

this stuff came with it um can you speak to that like how do I

how do I become the person that can consult the orthodontist on uh the retirement strategy and that whole thing

which feels like playing in Disneyland compared to 10 of these Facebook leads never answered the phone and

like I'm canceling right now which does not feel like anything like Disneyland

to most agency owners and and part of the reason that they're getting burned out yeah yeah so I mean I I'm going to

I'm going to default to the Strategic answer for this but um one of the major

things that I help and nudge and encourage and occasionally force people to do is sell a sell a future ID entity

um it's very difficult for people to do things if they can't see what they lead to right yeah and it's it's very

difficult to for to ask people to change in terms of behaviorally unless they can

have a some sense of who they change into you know who they ultimately become

um and in the agency world there's a lot of talk about what you can do for people but there's very little talk about what

that actually adds and what that actually brings to them in terms of at that that life level and that's just

about abstracting and understanding that if you're an orthodontist who um you

know in this initial period if you're work an extra 10 hours a week in the future you'll get 20 hours a week back :04 to play golf that's a different conversation right it's putting the truth on the table and saying as you'll :10 agree Mr business owner this requires investment we we require investment of time we require investment of money but :17 you'll get this back in multiples down the track because we Elevate you from operator to chairman in the business and :24 he's going ah I'm an operator right now I'd love to be a chairman but I need to invest something in the way so it is :31 getting the truth on the table and saying these are the things that you want these are the this is the price we :37 have to pay to some degree in the short term but this is the payoff because when you become the the the the orthodontist :45 chairman um you know then then they start to go yeah I'm just chairman of the board and I'm playing golf and you :52 know I'm not I'm not there in there day today pushing the buttons and chasing the payments and and those pieces so the :58 identity layer in um in marketing if you like and in terms of positioning um is :05 one that's often neglected because we focus on the functional things that :10 people do in the short term but when you start introducing that future identity piece about selling people on and you :16 know indicating who they become not only do you convert more people in the front end because you're taking away the risk :23 of change but you also get better buying in the application of that delivery because everybody's agreed that there's :29 a bigger payoff at the end because everybody's up leveled in the process of doing it got it so it's about figuring :36 out what that vision is so that you can paint it for your client it's not figuring out is giving it to them :43 because the brutal truth is most people LA Vision for themselves and for their lives but if you can paint a picture :48 that's desirable to them at least put lead them toward the promised land and and and they understand it and you know :55 what the alod dontist might find that he starts playing golf but he's better off um that he actually loved you know :00 volunteering at the dog shelter but you gave him the space and the time to do that but via you know a mutual :06 investment and you both and you both committed to play the game um so so giving them a future identity is about :12 spelling that out about what they become and who they become and then allowing that allowing that to unfold and :18 allowing them to discover it you know I have a concept called The Sovereign consultant you know I have that's a I'm :24 selling people on being a sovereign consultant who makes a million dollars profit a year in two days a week uh with :31 65 clients or less right you know what when you get there how you do it what you want to enjoy in the teams if you :37 want to work three days a week go for it but at least we got to it at least we agreed on the on the on the endpoint and :45 and we both understand that the map is in the terrain you know and the system I give people is is like a coloring book :51 that you buy I give you guidelines and boundaries and you know don't color outside that line but the Stop Needing, Start Attracting :59 colors you put in in in between are completely up to you yeah and final sorry with with help :08 of course and guidance yeah yeah of course um final question there how do you put :14 in your Outreach or your content um like I'm thinking of someone :20 who messaged me last week hey Katen if I if I could add $50,000 a month to what :28 you're doing if it's $50,000 a month in your business and in the next 60 :35 days like my my immediate thought and I would consider myself maybe someone who's dealing with higher level issues :42 at this point my immediate thought is that sounds exhausting whatever it is you're pitching like I don't really want :47 it because I don't need it and I think it goes back to what you're saying like the more the more you :54 don't need the money the more money will come to you but that's the same like the :01 the clients that people really want are the people that don't that aren't desperate for the extra 10K or the extra 50k :08 they're desperate for some sort of need inside them how do :14 you what's your advice to someone just like a an easy way to start implementing :21 that in their Outreach or their content or their ads Outreach is a is an interesting inter one because most :26 people their goal is to drive a conversation to do some convincing and some :32 showing so if I was to do cold Outreach and if you ever catch me doing cold :37 Outreach come over here and do something terrible to me um but if you ever if I ever did cold Outreach um I would :46 be sending it to someone who I believed would be the ideal person that I could :52 deliver a result for that I'd already delivered so if I was demonstrating to :57 you that I could give you $50,000 extra a month and get you 15 hours a week back :04 I would send you a demonstration of that I would send you a demonstration of this is :09 Bob he's an orthodontist and we got him an extra $50,000 a month while cutting his :16 working hours of this and I would demonstrate Bob on a camera that was :21 chilled and having a natural conversation about telling his experience and doing it rather than :27 saying I can do this for you and the the framers that a lot of people try to be :33 is the hero of someone's Journey but if you're if you make them :39 if you make your clients the hero and you the guide It's funny how your your the quality of what you do and who you :45 work with goes up dramatically because you've allowed people their own power :50 and you've allowed them to tell their story and then you're just inviting more people to you know obtain that power and :57 tell that story so so much of the Outreach I get is just terrible because :02 someone wants to tell me something that they don't know if I don't if I know it or not already I get all ones all the :10 time would you like to make would you get to 20K a month and I'm like I would have had to screw up a lot of stuff :15 right now to get to 20K a month I'd be going really far backwards but you know :21 that's what cold Outreach has become but a lot more I think you know a lot more demonstrating a lot more :28 showing and a lot less telling and a lot more force would get people a heck of a :34 lot further with greater people that are going to propel them ah heck of a lot further than they think they're even :40 capable of now yeah the word demonstration is what was coming to mind as you were Don't Sell, "Demonstrate" :47 discussing all of that demonstrating your content demonstrate in your ads demonstrate in your Outreach and you :52 don't have to sell like it's just not I I'm not the first person to say this :58 but changing your your content from how how to to how I yeah or how Bob or how :06 Keaton or how Rob did this yeah will have a unbelievably profound effect for :13 a small change and the response that you get to that :18 communication yeah and those stories are it goes back to like Sam ens :24 interviews back in the day like those those were more valuable than the salonin course because I just got I was :31 like oh they did this tiny thing at this moment and that I'm in that exact moment right now and you know the course was :37 helpful too but the the Epiphany Bridge even though it's not an epiphany Bridge :42 the epiphanies that come from the conversations and the the case studies are infinitely more powerful than just :50 the principles sometimes yeah yeah I mean the :56 I would humbly say that people learn more from modeling me than what I teach :02 them yeah yeah you and anybody who's a parent will understand this you know :09 very either directly or instinctually that you are what you do and what you :16 are in front of your children much more than what you say to them get off that phone as you spend six hours on your :23 iPhone doesn't work yeah get off your phone when you're not on your phone um and they can they can :31 observe that is is is the way to get that behavior in and it's the same with :38 clients treat them like children is that the message okay sure let's go with :44 that it makes yeah it makes me think of multiple times in your community this year I'm like I'm just excited to see :50 where he takes this like I'm going to learn I'm going to learn by the start stuff he starts implementing the stuff :55 he stops implementing how he switches this around I can get on the calls I can go through the course and the workshops :01 but yeah the demonstration is like oh that's cool I didn't think of that and :07 it sticks too it sticks more than the conversations we've had you know yeah :12 yeah I I just ran you know an experiment over the last three weeks in terms of an offer you know and next week I'll be :17 breaking that down about what really happened and what it what it actually looks like and then there's still the :24 unknown piece about what that you know in an offer driven model what you want is for that offer to lead organically :31 and naturally to the next offer you know and so far that offer from the first offer to the second offer converts a 50% :38 and that's a big breakthrough right you know getting people to give you $300 and :44 50% of them giving you 3,000 you know within three weeks after that is a significant breakthrough but on the :50 surface people can copy the $300 and plenty of people have but the next level :56 is or how did that actually work and what actually happened behind behind the scenes and and what is the what are the :01 subjective things in that what kind of people came through it and what are they doing and what are the problems and and what what they're learning so yeah the :08 model the modeling has multiple layers as well in terms of um because a lot of people delude themselves that they have :14 perfect information they see that person doing that and they're going to funnel hack them and do that but they don't The 0-$100k Way :20 actually understand the outcomes Downstream and so modeling modeling is multi-stage and also has a lot of depth :25 to it as well okay I know you need to take the puppy to the beach so I'll I'll close with this question it's a big day :33 uh yeah big day expectations you alluded to this earlier that's it's the downfall of this :42 space because it's not about you know it's not about that the :47 results weren't actually good it's just that somebody was expecting something different most times because you told :53 that to them or you implied it through a maybe a testimonial or some other kind :59 of marketing that you're talking about however you still have this big Vision :05 you give your clients and that's the ideal that everyone's striving towards how is that different from go go from 0 :14 to 100K in X time frame and why do you do it that way the purple book um got a :22 lot of people to escalate offers h to make big promises :28 and repeatedly over and over and you know over a decade of doing this thing :35 um I found small promises with big vision would out sell and out deliver um :43 and overd deliver on expectations much more than anything and so the the if you work hard on the big :51 Vision about what happens and what they become and you paint a Viv picture of the future then you're only saying that the small :57 promise that you're going to make is the first step on that Journey right and then you know together you'll work out :03 the terrain so for a lot of people for most people this is much more effective :10 than big promises because big promises are are just by definition harder to keep and there's more variables in them :16 but small promises are easier to deliver on easier to start and and and I found :23 easier to sell as well because if you use an example if you go :29 to since we're talking about orthodontist why not if you go to an orthodontic clinic that's getting you :36 know two leads a month and you say that I can get you 40 booked qualified appointments every single month you know :42 on autopilot without touching a single thing that experience doesn't feel close :49 to what they're doing now it feels like it comes with a lot of baggage and a lot of stretch and lot more work and a lot :56 more stress right M but if you say you're at two Unbound leads two Unbound :02 leads a month and I'm going to get you to four that feels like a positive First Step you know yeah and then ultimately :09 we're we're moving towards a state where you're doing you're getting this many inbound leads but you're only working :14 this time and then we can start to introduce different currencies so it's about understanding that a small promise :19 is easy to keep and easy to sell at the beginning and easy to deliver but it it's a small promise on a step into it L :25 of vision and what's your small promise I'll get you an offer that you can sell :30 um with your thumbs on on a Google doc and if we if we do it to one person we can we can do it with a 100 got it and :37 then the big vision is the two hours or two days a week million dollars a year what does that mean to you where do you :43 want to go with it Etc you know let's let's get some results together first let's let's put an offer together that :49 you can sell you know in ways that that are effortless to you compared to maybe what you've and how you've done it :54 before um if we get one if we get one is their belief that we can get two 10 and :00 and 100 yeah it's like your your weekly pricing thing which is just lower the :06 now number instead of a th a month it's 250 a week so people can get in but it's the same with believability like lower :13 than now believability like do you think we could have an offer that you're ready to sell next week yeah that's believable :20 it's actually what I want versus Pie in the Sky guarantee 100K a month in two :27 months and you know nobody hits it because they didn't do the 12 things every single day on the :35 guarantee the title is old as time do you yeah do you get people asking like :41 because I struggled with this when I I like defined the big Vision which for me was like it was like 200k a year uh :48 you're working 20 hours a week on your agency and like you're taking home 200k :53 a year and I would get a lot of people being like well who how many people have :59 done that and um you know is that something like how do you do it what's :04 the model like they're they're so they get fixated on this Vision as if :09 it's the gospel truth when really it's just like look if it's 150 for you not :15 200 that's fine do you get that kind of thing and and if so what do you say to it I I don't I don't get it at all but I :22 have a I have a distinct advantage that I am my own case :29 study so if I put my own mask on First and do fun things with fun people and :34 make lots of money I just say to people do you want something like this or your :40 version of it and they go okay and if you don't have that Advantage which is :46 extremely meta like do what you teach and teach what you do then you only need one example you know I've I've seen :55 plenty of cases where someone's just got one ideal case study that they leverage :00 to get a hundred more of those people as the ideal case study so the magical number in these in the in the course of :06 demonstration is usually one right because one leads to two yeah and if you :11 can demonstrate that you can that you can do it once and you can demonstrate :17 you understand the principle success in that and the Strategic level of mechanisms and the vision level of of :25 identity that you that you paint a picture of then you will have more results and more case studies than you :31 can shake a stick out but it it all started with one and um you know I've :37 got rich by getting other people Rich right yeah it's it's it's and the more I :44 I work to that ideal and and then layer enjoyment over the top of it then the :50 better it all works for everybody very cool um okay okay so you have a book More of James's Secret :56 tell everybody where they can find the book and then we'll end this thing The Sovereign consultant.com it's a book it :04 will tell you how to build a million doll Consulting business in two days a week or less and I'll show :10 it's it's a it's a it's a proper book not one of these like hey here's some vague ideas and uh buy my next 997 :20 course to do it it actually tells you how to do it for 10 bucks but it's it's also not that long right it's like 68 :26 pages oh wow 68 and it's got a couple of videos on the other side of it showing exactly how to do it so uh uh people can :35 get the how-to for $10 or $100,000 right and and and a lot of stops in between um but I'm always like :42 this is how to do it um you know I give away the ideas and and then people will take them where they where they need to :48 take them and and some some choose to get my help along the way love it James thanks so much enjoy the walk on the :54 beach and we'll see you next time thank you sir

Ignore Your Weaknesses if you want to get rich:

cool dude we're finally doing it so this is hilarious James and I were just talking about how you and I we don't

have to there's no one else here no it's just us dude we have had this conversation uh just not recorded for

hundreds of hours literally hundreds yeah literally hundreds it's funny man I don't know what's kept us from actually

putting the putting the camera on or a mic and just like sharing it and I think like I had a conversation with you or I

text you when I was in New Zealand a few weeks ago and I was like we have to record something because I feel like we have good conversations and it's not

like we have all the answers but we have answers that have worked for us that will hopefully work for other people as

well yeah and so I have a sense of my obligation to go like let's just like turn it on share what we have and

hopefully uh you know one or two people will be helped in the process we have to do it yeah so we live in Bali you live

two minutes up the road which is fantastic and um I actually can't remember where we met we I I got to know

you more deeply at takimore's event end of 2019 I think in manly in Sydney yeah

we met before then we'd chattered but we hadn't physically met classic classic internet even though the little tiny

internet community in New Zealand is literally tiny yeah exactly exactly and

then um and then you were in Bali at the time so you came over to manly we spent those few days together you went back to Bali covet happened you came back to New

Zealand we spent a lot of time uh together then I remember we spent a couple of days together in Auckland which was great um we're now when our

cities weren't in lockdown um and uh such a weird time and and now that I live here it's just been amazing

because we obviously get to catch up yeah uh multiple times a week and uh there's our favorite Cafe out there uh

called honey that we hang out at and so um anyway if we go back for you I meant you when you were already doing this and

there was a time when you weren't what is that what is this by the way exactly I mean I think we'll go there though

yeah yeah so whatever it is the heck that we do right now there was a time when you didn't do that and so without going through the whole origin story of

like well and actually let me ask because I don't even know yeah where were you born born in Auckland okay New

Zealand yeah but mostly adult life was in the UK so I went there in my early 20s right so what were you doing in the

UK so my first job for all the sales right so move say that again what sales and sales so I got the I got the blue

chip training right like Vodafone BMW and those companies and then I went to become a financial advisor right and um

I went there and they were like hey we lend money out and we charge interest on it and people pay it back and I was like

oh this is a bank cool and so um I always wanted to work for myself dad dad was a entrepreneur right you know did

car parks and music businesses and all kinds of things right so that that was like the model you know you do you do

your own thing and um went worked for a bank and was like I have to turn up to a bank and wear a uniform yeah and like

completely the opposite of what an entrepreneur wants to do about you know where what we're wearing and no shoes and [ __ ] like that yeah but it was like

okay this business thing can be really simple you can just have something that people want so I started a finance company but the

I got a consumer credit license in the UK and I went door-to-door and I sold photography packages right and low

income areas so I would knock on a door and I'd sell them a photography package for 200 quid right and then they'd pay

it off interest free over 20 weeks yeah 10 pounds a week and then after four weeks I could go and sell that to a

finance company who'd pay me more than the face value of everything and I made a couple hundred quid off each one yeah and um I was like this is good this is

good and then um but look quick pause was it good in the sense of how did you find the work part of it like you're

knocking on doors selling photography like was that was a brutally hard season

of like learning the skills and having doors shut in your face see I didn't and even in hindsight I didn't right because

when I was at school all my friends were going to work at the mall to do present wrapping and work at the body shop in

the warehouse over Christmas right like when we're 14 15 and I was like screw that you get five bucks an hour right

and I went to do like work in a galvanizing Factory for 20 bucks an hour look we're stacking magazines so I was

always like where's the highest yield I didn't I never minded the work yeah so I think going forward into like knocking

on door sucks right because the the level of rejection and danger you get yeah is ridiculous but I never even in

hindsight and maybe I've romanticized it because I've told the story many times yeah even in hindsight I didn't find it

difficult I found it interesting because I love I love creating something and offering it someone else and and then

learning and tweaking along the way and that's been the consistent path through there yeah right so you're so you're

selling these doing the stuff door-to-door yeah and then where did it go from there so I learned WordPress and I learned SEO because the the guys I was

selling my leads to they were like we're doing online leads yeah so I self-taught myself WordPress and I self-taught

myself SEO and I started dabbling with Google ads right so I started generating leads online so I could get an online lead for like six or seven pounds and

sell it for 50 Quid to these they're kind of I mean they're called kneecap finance companies I mean they're dot they trap people and it which I like

look back in hindsight and go yeah the moral wait a minute the moral you know kind of things and that's what made me

end it yeah because I was like I saw someone say you know if you can't imagine being in this business in five

years like why are you even in it today yeah but and correspondingly at the same

time I got done and I had a 70 000 pound in uh bill that I owed on uh ads and all

these things for leads that I couldn't sell to them because they all went out of business and the financial crisis oh okay so that was around the time in 2008

2009 so in the space of a couple of weeks all my customers went out of business and stopped paying me the financial crisis hit and found out we're

pregnant with our first child what was that period of your life like again like as a marketer probably

romanticized it so it's even it's even more difficult yeah yeah that was [ __ ] stressful it was unbelievably

stressful but it's in those moments where you're like what do I really want to do who do I really want to be and was

that clear to you at that time or is that something that was evolving like no not at all I think you know in hindsight

the North Star has always been the tinkering piece making something putting it out there like I was always a top

performer in sales because I'd always be interested in the person an interest in the psychology of what I was saying what

was coming across the dynamic the relationship and those things and I think the next thing that I did I was

literally sitting at home one night watching everything crumble and I emailed a startup in London called

living social so Groupon and living social have both come onto the market a daily deals market and then just

exploded into this thing because local businesses could use them to get customers which is notoriously difficult

right and I emailed the general manager who like they'd come to London they had about four or five people and he said can you be in central London at eight

o'clock the next morning it's like yeah it was like a response like that do an email at you know 11 o'clock at night

got there got the job on the spot and then 16 months later there were 350

people they've been funded with 800 Million by Amazon I was in the middle of another thing which was all about making

lots of offers right and you know and but in the online space this is fascinating because I don't even know

this stuff like I know I know the New Zealand Origins yeah I didn't quite know the UK stuff and so at this time was

like I'm fascinated because most entrepreneurs have the story of like I was born an entrepreneur I was

unemployable I kept getting fired from places that doesn't seem like it's your story like I'm sure there were moments

of like this is hard I would rather be doing my own thing but like were apart from the tinkering was was Freedom

autonomy sovereignty was that a big part of the value set at that point or did that come over time as you're exposed to

more kind of the online space and people actually talking about it yeah it was only after Max was born so max is my son

it's only after Max was born that I started to look at them environment we're in and not one to not want to have

children in the in the system you know the type of things that we call them that we maybe not say out loud the

consequence of what I did became much more real yeah that it wasn't just me

and I could float through and it didn't matter if I you know maybe did things that were compromising values like

working in an industry that keeps people in debt didn't matter right there's no consequence it was like I was making

money who cares yeah yeah but after he was born I was looking at what we are in in the system yeah in terms of you know

the system of society and especially in Western society and I was like okay you need to have options yeah you know and

the belief that has never gone away is like true freedom is Downstream of Financial Freedom yeah so you can make a

lot of impact and all these words the buzzwords but unless you've got choices yeah you can't really get to True

Freedom you know and people can throw around what that means to them and it is very personal but it was until Max was

born that I really thought I need to cultivate an environment where I'm living in something that gives some choices yeah because of that sense that

the world's not going to be the same and if it's the same as it is now then I'd rather plot an alternative course right

around it yeah I I feel like I didn't even have a work ethic until I got married and especially when I had my

first kid Brooklyn like seven years ago that was when I felt was like I found another gear I was like oh okay like I

like the stakes are higher especially because my wife and I you know for most of our 20s were working for the church we were broke but we were it was a

mutually we both decided we were going to be broke and so neither one of us was resentful or bitter it was like we're on

the trenches together but then you bring a human into it and I was like man this isn't his choice like I need to I need

to like find another gear in myself to kind of take things to the next level and so when you look where does New

Zealand enter into the picture was that around that time a little bit after because I know you then stayed in that industry and came to New Zealand yeah so

I was approached by the guys who cloned Groupon in New Zealand which is called grab one right and then more like you

know this industry and that we're roughly in Europe and the us because

it's a U.S startup but I was in I was in London about two years ahead of the sophistication curve of like what what

was going to happen what was the market expanding into products expanding into travel and those kind of things yeah and

so I went back did some stuff with them on travel and like a sales kind of role

when you saying we're back you went back to New Zealand went back to New Zealand yeah and that was always in the plan but that freedom thing was under I used to

listen to a podcast called um tropical MBA right and it was by two two dudes down and in who were here in Bali right

at the time over a decade ago wow they were talking about one megabit internet and like pitted roads and stuff like

that which is a bit different to now yeah yeah but the vibe was the same yeah that was that was the beginning of the digital Nomad digital Nomad became a

phrase yeah right and I was like going on the train into work listening to these dudes jamming and it was like that

was happening along the way in terms of the the underlying soundtrack of like this something something else going on yeah and then went back to New Zealand

and went worked on travel got was made marketing manager and my marketing director within a few months and um

again it's like right in the middle of this environment where you can test human psychology right which is addictive right yeah you put these

things out there on mass and large numbers and you see how people respond yeah and that that's super addictive to

me so I've always been in the middle of like that interrelationship and the feedback loop of in business of like

making offers and and watching those things come back and like how are people responding to this how are they acting yeah but and that cut my teeth in terms

of to where we are now and what we do now and so in that time was were you

approaching things as an artist or an engineer like was there a mix of both was it like you feeling like you were

creating or is like building the machine and the numbers and the we sent out an email that got this click-through rate

was it a mix of both like how are you naturally wired and kind of what was coming out of their time at the time it was not artists it was more teacher

whereas I've stopped the responsibility of being a fan rather seriously in terms of being I'm trying to be a model and I

distinctly remember before I went back to New Zealand I made a commitment to give all my ideas away right so I started accepting stuff that scared the

[ __ ] out of me like speaking gigs and those kind of things which in hindsight was a great move yeah because when I wanted to leave Consulting and those

things were not not a problem right because I built a profile and built a reputation and a 100 million dollar business yeah and I think around that

time I imagine you probably didn't have the scarcity that kicks in when you then start charging for your information because when you start charging for

information you're like well if I'm charging for it over here and I give it away over here it must devalue the thing that people are buying yeah but you

didn't have that you just had the I'm in the trenches doing it I'm just going to share it because that means no less for me if you know the thing

that I'm doing yeah yeah and it means I don't have the struggle story of when I started Consulting as well right like my

first monthly invoice 40 Grand yeah perfect because I was mentored by senior people who were like you go into companies you tell them what to do you

hope they listen and they pay your invoices every month yeah so was it so the Consulting Journey because that

sounds like it evolved really naturally you became really good in your industry you got head hunted from UK to New

Zealand you Rose up the ranks there and then did that Consulting naturally go to

in-person consultation where you're working with a team in person it's it's more corporate c-suite type stuff yeah

corporate where I had a reputation as someone who was really comfortable sitting in a boardroom and talking the

talk commercially right but also getting down on the trenches right because I'd worked in startups you had to be like

that you had to know how to run a Facebook ad yeah because there wasn't always someone there to do it but you

also knew had to know how to talk about a 10 million budget yeah right so the two different skill sets in the end of

the spectrum so I was quite used filters when some companies were going into like the scrappy kind of incubator stage

we're going to start up lots of internal tests and start businesses inside where I go along and talk to them in corporate

speak but also startup speak because they knew that I'd be happy to get my hand to roll my sleeves up and do stuff

and so when you think back to that period was that a seamless transition was that something that came with

reservations or fears there was any sense of imposter syndrome because I know like working with people in the

online space and it's different when you go from I'm using my Facebook for friends and family and then all of a

sudden I'm a business coach and there's that element but going from being the person who got had a job was paying to

do it to now teaching other people was there like things you had to overcome was there a story you had to unravel

like what was that kind of process like for you to actually get started the biggest thing the biggest thing for me was a discipline of it because the work

was so easy that I had to learn like lots of things to kind of Pat it out you

know so there was a discipline of it of like is this actually am I doing the right thing am I doing the right am I

doing the right job because lots of people wouldn't even listen to the advice that I was giving them yeah right

so then you start to have the moral questions around it but I I had the easiest start to Consulting ever because

I consulted back to the company that I that I was formerly a marketing director right so you know it's like struggle to

get your first client we just signed the people you used to work with and then start adding clients from there yeah but the first major fear moment in terms of

like taking a leap was was stopping that yeah right and going I'm dependent on

this single source of income so if I stop it then that was my first big fear and I held on for like four months too

long and I had a coach at the time and it sat there every Wednesday and she would you know walk me through it and

something about the weekly coaching sessions that's like a a relic of of old you know we've been together for an hour

I drive to you you drive to me we do it on Zoom whatever and making the decision you want to make but are too scared to

make it yeah and seeking permission in some other way yeah so the big fear was like leaving my first client but that's

when I'm met a young Sam Evans young saying moments I love it all Circle back

to him in a second because obviously he played a crucial role for both he did yeah but with you in the role that

you're in then being able to consult yeah it sounds like it's uh you know nice for you James but I have to you

know get clients and I don't have that but also for you I imagine there was years like behind the scenes you're kind

of skimming over the fact that I imagine there was a lot of really deep skill set

building throughout that time like it wasn't just like right place right time I could talk the talk I imagine there

was the hours of podcasts the blogs the you know whatever it might be like what did that process of actually building

the skill set so like the company that you worked for they still had to see enough value in what you did to want to pay you the money that you charged what

was that process like to build that skill set at work right like I I developed a deep skill set across sales

and marketing specifically by doing it yeah right in the in the train

it's had Blue Chip sales you know Vodafone BMW and Xerox like sales

training which is Xerox sales training in Europe is considered to be like the best sales training on earth right like

you know relationship building and those things from corporate Enterprise all the way down to selling phones in a shop

yeah you know a Vodafone when I worked in there in New Zealand when I was a student and it's getting the skills on

the and but also and I think I'm more ruthless about these days it's like focusing on what you're good at because

there's so much idealism around skill acquisition because everything's a skill yeah and it's and it's really like okay

double down on what you're good at and largely ignore the bits that you that you aren't and that's a tough lesson to

learn like I was a terrible people manager right and I inherited these teams and I didn't know what didn't know

how to manage I'm gonna run ads guys it's going to be awesome yeah but I'd lean in on the commercials on the marketing on you know the detail of

those things yeah and go back to them and the results will always take take you through you don't have to be the

easiest person to work with yeah you don't even have to be liked but if you're effective you can go a really

long way right so I think I always focused on things I was effective at and

avoid it out of probably internal fear all the things I was I was I was proving

to be bad at yeah which I think is also underrated like I think too many people try to generalize too fast yeah I've

shamed myself horribly for that over the years of like no I should build a team yeah I should be a good manager I should

be this I should be there and it doesn't matter how hard you wish for it if there's no true genuine desire there

yeah it's very difficult to acquire skills when you don't have desire behind them yeah it's very difficult to wear I

really want to be good at this and I need to be good at this when there's no actual want like deep inside you to want

to do it well well I think we'll come back to this but like this idea that business needs to be hard is a really

prevalent one because I think business is already hard because we have to grow and gain skills and stick out things

things and develop character traits that allow us to focus on one thing for a really long time but then people also

make it unnecessarily hard they go well I'm not good at this so I must get better at it because you know I I don't

want to have a weak Link in the chain I don't want to have a hole in the bucket but like man I mean we have friends who have great businesses and suck at like

huge parts of it right they either hire around themselves we have multi-millionaire friends who can barely tie their shoes yeah yeah

yeah like that's a reality yeah and I'm useless at some you know some very normal we talked about this with life

admin right yeah like I would way rather be hit with a hundred thousand dollar tax bill and have to figure that out

over the next month then organize a youth camp you know like the scale of of

the problem is significantly different but the complexity or even just like if you peel it back if I had to like buy

our groceries every week and things like that it sounds so such a luxury but like those things stress me out like those

everyday things but but so many entrepreneurs think they need a master at all like I need to have all of the things sort of me good at Marketing

sales maybe the best dad the best husband and then that means I need to take all of the stereotypical things I need to be amazing at sitting down and

playing with my kids with Lego for hours at a time I need to have the Lawns mode the Hedge trimmed whatever else but you

bring that to business it's the same deal my take is that it's a product of weaponizing Shame right and it starts at

a young age because we need the system needs people to be in a certain way and

compliant with doing those things in productive and with weaponized shame and

now we've Amplified it with this thing called the internet to say if you don't want things these things you're not

normal then there's something wrong with you if you don't want to be like this if you don't want to spend your days like that if you don't believe these things

then there's something morally wrong with you and we're going to shame you yeah and it's weaponized everywhere yeah

and it's weaponized by people's Often by the people that are closest to the recipient of that shame right

because they're like you should want this like I was asked by people who came to visit a couple of weeks ago as we're

sitting in our house with our staff everybody here has local staff we have a family it's true guys

and they're like how do you feel about these people serving you and I was like amazing

amazing because this family have a house here they've got Vehicles they've got

they send their kids to school that their son's getting a higher education because they work for me and they love

my kids just like they're their own it feels great but that's just one example

of things to be like well you shouldn't have people serve you yet as an entrepreneur your time like time is the

only scarce thing on earth unless you yield it properly with the skill set that you were either innately given and

Amplified you are going to fail to create the most value you possibly can so you should be ashamed of doing the

things you're bad at and doing the things that you shouldn't actually be doing because it's going to cost you and

it's going to cost the people who depend on you yeah and this this is uh we'll get to it in a second but let's talk

about Sam ovens because he went through that period which is kind of what my mind is going to now but most people

listening will know who the heck Samuel is yeah but before there was the same of the internet there was the same of New Zealand and they were not the same I met

the sander of New Zealand right yeah so talk us through who that person was uh by the way if anyone wants to go down a fun Rabbit Hole search Sam ovens

stuff.co.nz there's like a picture of this Penthouse apartment uh I think it's like 2014.

um he's right in the Auckland viaduct in the harbor he's got a zebra rug a motorcycle a pistol like all of these

like Antiques and things like that around this house and he's just the cool dude of Auckland but like who was this guy that you met at that time so I was I

was kind of in that transition so I was still Consulting for the main the main guys and I was still kind of acting

marketing director but I wasn't actually employed by them so I was running I'm going out Consulting

and I reached out to him because he'd been on Mexico oh yeah with SNAP inspect

and um his software company his software company at the time and I met this extremely confident it's not nose kid

really that's what I thought when I walked away because he's like he's 10 years 12 years younger than me yeah and

I was like big swinging dick you know I work for the fastest growing country and Company in the country like you know

you've got it all worked out but but I was like kind of enthralled by his confidence and his and his vision about

I just do Consulting to generate cash flow to build the software company and at the time the software company was the main thing and then in a software

company if anyone who doesn't know was an app for property managers property inspection probably inspection it was

really good like I'm not a property manager but it you can take fixtures and it solved a real pain problem it still

exists and um he's like yeah since the interview lots of people reached out talk about you know because he he kind

of alluded to this doing consulting to generate cash flow for other things or because that was this kind of angle at

the time and that's what he was doing and he said I'm starting a thing and at the time it was like a Dropbox folder

full of stuff and it was just putting online and kajabi and I signed up like

months later when it was actually a proper products do you remember all that those six grand six grand and this is

twenty he did me a solid though he did it in New Zealand Dollars oh my man he did at the time that was like very

welcome yeah because I think six grand us at the time was like 10 grand kiwi or something like that yeah and he's like

dude don't tell anyone but I'll do it in kiwi dollars like thanks bro yeah and this was 2014. 2015. oh it's later than

that right no about 2015. yeah yeah it would be about 20 2014 2015. so he's

based in New Zealand Consulting is is a side hustle and you kind of get into this Dropbox community of like there's

some trainings there's no Consulting accelerator that many people would have experienced later yeah and what was that

experience like because because at this point I imagine you're still Consulting in person I was still Consulting in

person and we moved to waiheke island off Auckland and so I was starting commuting and I was like I've got a job

again I've got a flipping job again right and because it was like single source of income have to get up have to

go to a place have to stay there have to come back and hop on a boat to get to Auckland boat yeah like wait if anyone

who doesn't know waiheke island is not connected via a bridge it's like a 45

year 35 yes 35 minute Theory and it's a beautiful Lifestyle on there but then to have to go to the CBD or wherever you're

going every day that was yeah it drained me real quick yeah and after you know having all those ideas sitting in my

head and then that kind of sub track playing in the background through podcasts and things of freedom and

location Independence and digital nomadism I needed to do my own thing and so through Sam's course I launched my

first product e-commerce engine and then we did a million and it was about 13

months yeah well yeah talk about timing as well like unfair advantages like back in the day when you could get leads for

a dollar on Facebook and like course 50 bucks yeah yeah but literally just you know got on the phone first price point

was 2500 yeah then put it up to 6 Grand later so walk me through that process so you've got all this expertise you've

built in person he tells you how to package it into a course or are you coaching one-to-one like what does that

look like yeah like the classic you know course with calls model that I call it now like I had a Google drive

folder with six modules in it and like an introduction yeah uh a free Facebook group no sorry a Facebook group which is

obviously free but paid for for clients yeah and then um then a weekly call with um what was it called on go to webinar

oh goodness yeah 400 bucks a month at the time man yeah that's crazy yeah we don't know how good I'm done now it was

great yeah and e-commerce them was really fragmented so it's like pre-shopify so it was really like people

had all these different it wasn't pre-shopify but it was like early it wasn't a big thing like it is now like the de facto solution for Ecom yeah so

all these people had all these like different platforms and the tech stuff was a bit of a nightmare yeah so to give

them like email templates and card abandoned sequences and conversion and Facebook ad templates it was a brand new

thing at the time to that to that market it was like what you give me stuff that works out of the box and I just go and

copy and paste it and you help me modify it and I use it and it makes money yeah cool and so that was the most natural people for you to work with I guess

having got come from uh grab one and Groupon yeah was you're now just in that

e-commerce space you're not a coach helping coaches get clients it's literally like you have an e-commerce store it's uh I've seen three billion

dollars of e-commerce transactions flow past my herbals yeah so I was like I know how to make people buy stuff online

yeah so what was that learning curve like going online the biggest learning curve was just the deployment of it

because I thought I had to know all the tech and all those things you know the click funnels templates and that kind of

stuff yeah so that's all the stuff that that tripped me up sorry guys quick technical difficulty uh I had a camera

that overheated we are back in the game so we're talking about you coaching online e-commerce and talking about the

learning curve and so the biggest challenge for you at that time was the deployment like they're actually getting the stuff done yeah going through all

the steps yeah well it's the the stuff that you think you need that you don't really yeah and like the the first

iteration of that course was like I've got to get this done screw it so that's why I use like Google drive right and a

Facebook group and you know that because I was sick of passing around and

procrastinating on myself sort of going I need to host it in an online thing yeah and it's the same thing you see now

with I need all this stuff to be to make it look a certain way yeah so I was much

more worried about what people thought about it then it was it something that you were getting from Sam as well at the time meaning like you bought into a

program that was awesome on Dropbox because I'm sure at that time there were some people that just changed it so I

didn't I wasn't I was on the cusp of like there was still stuff stored there yeah and I think the first iteration was

just a tree of files and then there was you know the kajabi stuff and videos and

again it was like building it as we were going through it yeah you know the first version up level well I think one of the

the best I don't know if you said this out loud or if this was just something I took from uh Consulting accelerator but when I started in 2018 yeah I had skills

that I could transfer to marketing but I had no marketing experience per se I had no ads experience no funnels and so I

was really good at sales so I was like getting people to say yes and then going all right now I need to figure out how to do this and I'll never forget just

the belief I got from going through this program was like I need to believe my ability to figure it out so I never

forget hiring a a getting a client and I was doing something around his content and then he hired me to do his Facebook

ads and my confidence came from the fact that Sam had all the modules on Facebook

ads in there even though I hadn't gone through them and never run a Facebook ad so I run this client's card and he's

like yeah man really need these ads to work and I'm like they're gonna to be amazing right and then I go through all

of Sam's stuff and then overnight and then at 5am I launched the client's ads and then the next morning I wake up

however many hours are later and he's got all of these webinar registrations and his crushing but for me it was like

that delusion that even though I didn't have the expertise I could borrow it from someone else and also I just I

needed to believe my ability to figure it out and I think that's a belief that served me so much I don't know if there was anything around that time that that

kind of carried you through belief-wise can you remember what your self-taught was in that time because you were going from in person to online you're running

ads people were now probably talking crap on your ads and you're now an expert selling a product like what was

that self-talk that was a complete Paradox because I was the big deal I was a marketing director of like the

fastest growing company in the country so it was a paradox of like the small Fray internet little tiny stuff was like

who cares right what's the big deal but the ego was the thing that was preventing me

from doing the stuff I needed to do because it didn't look right right so

both of those opposing forces got me stuck right in terms of not launching it

fast enough not hitting the ground running because when I did it was like it was off straight away so there was a

paradox of like I'm really good look at this this stuff's little it's so

easy I could phone it in yeah but also I needed it to look a certain way because

I was worried people went away you've got a reputation you've got yeah yeah I get it so it was like the worst Paradox

you can get because the two opposing forces of the equal you're just stuck in place yeah and I was for months stuck in

place doing what like were you were you doing the equivalent of like I'm building a website for myself I was doing the equivalent of like I'm gonna

move these boxes around on this landing page and make and like do the slides for

that vsl video again yeah yeah and by Friday it will be done oh no I should

change that word right you know perfectionist procrastination yeah because I was worried about what people

would think about it which I think is human nature like like I think there'd be a lot of people uh listening who

laugh at something like that and go I remember those days or that's so funny but most of my coaching calls are

dealing with people even at multiples and figures who were just overthinking stuff they're they're in they're in a

kind of that a loop of productive procrastination I'm not not like this is one of the things I've learned about entrepreneurs normal people when they're

overwhelmed or unclear right normally right they they uh don't do anything right so that's why when you talk to

normal people uh the everyday person around procrastination it's such a huge topic because they're struggling with

inaction most entrepreneurs struggle with too much action they're actually taking so much action in so many

different directions that it's the thing causing them to not move forward because they're productively procrastinating

right so instead of me creating the module I'm going to listen to 10 podcasts and five of the best YouTube

videos on it and read three books on it so that I create the perfect uh podcast of the perfect module or the whatever it

may be yeah and that version of what you went through I'm trying to get the landing page perfect is the same thing

that everyone goes through it just looks different it looks more mature that it's the same behavior in that same whether

it's scarcity or insecurity or inadequacy driving people for like I'm just waiting for it to be perfect right

that's it's a perfectionism that people wrestle fully I think also that there's also as you grow up there's a there's a

creation of optionality get this thing so you can get that thing you know get the get the qualification so you can get

the job so if you create options for yourself if you create more options yourself for yourself it's better the

reality is very different the more options just lead you to more you know more noise in the system to say what's

the actual signal and because it's the hardest question to answer what do I want right so that you get more options

to get things that other people want that you think you should want so then you just get stuck because you're

dealing with your own internal procrastination but you're also looking at the wants of others and going

maybe I should want that maybe what I want isn't good enough yeah I totally agree and I think that's um the whole idea of people are suffering from the

the silent disease of of confusion or lack of clarity is so true yeah right most people just do not know what they

want or if or if they know what they want they don't know why they want it oh you want to get to 50K a month why

sounds great you know 100 camera I would love to shake Russell brunson's hand but they don't have a vision that's fueled

by a motivation that will actually push them through and so they're just stuck in cycles of like I think the part at

the end of the rainbow is going to be awesome and it's going to be a 50k a month and then you get there and it's not there yeah people don't typically

have a Clear Vision with a clear motivation that's actually going to push them through the different seasons yeah

I also I also see that there's also the other sea there's a lack of consequence right yeah yeah there's we we love

Clarity but we also act on consequence and you know an example would be in our

friends group at the moment lots of parents in their 40s and a couple of people have died of

heart attacks right right and their 40s you know too early too young

and it has prompted lots of people to look at their genetic line get tested

heart health diet all those things but until then everyone was carrying on eating the fried food

and doing the doing all the things because there was like there's no obvious consequence to the behavior

and people go oh you want to live long time for your kids and you know they they sound nice in a theory in a

theoretical way but when it comes to it fried chips taste nice you know and and

beer is good sometimes you know but I think it's also consequence there's very in Comfort there's very little

consequence yeah there's very little consequence to not doing the thing yeah and this is why I see so many

entrepreneurs driven by the darkness driven by that dark thing of like I've got to prove my dad wrong yeah I was

born when I was young that teacher you know who said that I was never going to amount to anything and you know when I

was 14 I mean that the seeds of that are there yeah and the consequence of not doing it is more internal pain yeah and

the the benefit of doing it is a some misaligned view that that will provide

relief from that pain yeah and so I think consequence motivates most action

and you don't need to be clear about something to do it yeah because

Clarity is a fiction how when covert everyone was like wow well this is really you know we didn't see this

coming and it's like we never see the future coming yeah it's a ludicrous analogy because it's like we didn't see

the future coming before covert and we don't see the future coming during it and after yeah you know in these ideas

you can't even say covert you've got to get it out um the thing the thing that happened in

2020 but you know that there was there's this idea that Clarity needs to be

present before we take action there's an idea that belief needs to be present to take action and I was sharing with

clients recently of like I need so little evidence now to believe in something like you know we call it Instinct and we

call these like accumulated wisdom and all this stuff but I see something working once and I'm like I'm gonna do a lot more of this yeah yeah you know and

I think as you go along you you don't need as much belief because you you can pattern match some things and go well

this is like this so I'm going to do more of it right and you don't need belief and Clarity to do it but you need some consequence to make you move

otherwise you ain't doing it isn't that fascinating thing about like the amount of convincing you need to start a business versus the amount of convincing

you need to launch a new offer right like people can convince themselves in a heartbeat

to go I need to launch a new tripwire a new funnel whatever but to get over that hump of belief around uh I have

something to to give of value uh is this huge insurmountable thing do you feel

like that's a skill set is is that a belief in and of itself like what is that that actually enables you and us uh

the further we get along to take faster action to to stop living in the place of overthinking yeah and in action like

what is that I think I think it's giving gratitude to the the changes you've made and not judging them I think something I

do with clients quite a bit who have that belief that their stuff isn't good enough or they're going to not put an offer out there is go back and let them

mind the past really look at the work they've done and the magic that you've

created through an accumulated lived life you know you don't even need to be that old to have done stuff you know

most of the people I work with tend to be older with kids and those kind of things this is more accumulated experience but I think if you go back

and mine what you've done and then you link the human story to the impact of that you know I I had a client a while

ago who was you know it was property finding he's like I just find people houses yeah but who lives in those

houses what families are made what decisions are made and those things it's like it's not in and if you link the

outcomes of what you've done in the past to the human impact of things it makes it much more real than just a transaction of money because those

things are fictional they're made up we made all the stuff up just to ease the wheels yeah well it literally is right

yeah yeah but we but if we link the benefits and to the impact that we've had on

other people we can actually start to display empathy and have a motion to say

well I actually did something that was worth it I did something that was valuable right because everyone's got a legacy

and if we actually learn to appreciate the Legacy we can turn a lot of those things into motivation to do things now

to say well no if this only helps one person it's good enough you know I I

write like that yeah I speak to one person people go oh you're a good writer and it's like because I'm writing to one

person at a time and if it if it helps one person great if it helps a hundred even better and that's what one of the

things I think that's really fascinating is the further I get along on this journey the simpler Everything feels in my brain yeah like when you are running

a Facebook ad you feel like you were trying to I mean you I I didn't understand the mechanics of what I was

trying to do I was like there is an algorithm and there is an ad and there are all of these masses of people that

I'm trying to like get on their screen and get them a click rather than going like I'm trying to Target John who's

probably sitting on the loop who's a human right yeah who has this distinct like current situation this desired

situation I'm just trying to motivate him a click I don't think I was thinking ever that personal it felt so complex

and then now over time it's like this is easy this is simple like marketing is so simple right yeah but but it's something

that you have to work through right you said earlier uh Simplicity comes through complexity yeah right like oftentimes it

we have to go through the complex and the hard to get to the simple and the easy yeah so when you launched right

circling back you were coaching on e-commerce you're working with slick Sam ovens you're going through his course

you said you did a million and 13 months you obviously didn't stay in that Niche although that business model without

going through the linear journey of every kind of six months how did it change and what it looked like you've evolved tons like there has been so many

different twists and turns you've you've had the good and the bad like I have like I'll never forget being a manly and

the business that you had then was so radically different and so not a fit for

you at that time compared to the business that you know why hiki James was crushing and cranking 18 months

earlier and so when you think about uh going from e-commerce to the next Market

to the next offer obviously there are metrics like I don't so much want to focus on the you know an

offer gets tired a funnel gets tired and so we launch something new but what is that Journey looked like and felt like

for you in it like was it a reflection of your personal growth was it that you were growing as a human being and all of

a sudden the old business model didn't feel like it fit like what did that what did the evolution of the business models

in the kind of last six to eight years look and feel like for you autistic

no like seriously I say it with you know a smile on my face but I'm a

highly sensitive person and so my journey was essentially mimicking the

things I was paying attention to or the mentors of the people persons of esteem

or authority that I was looking at at the time yeah and then I was just becoming derivatives of them right I'm a

successful mimic which is again a challenging place because I was really

good at mimicking because I could make it effective by just tweaking it enough to make it my own and then the feedback

loop will be successful you can make a million dollars a year great but I topped out at two because I

couldn't mimic my way through the next curve because I didn't want to because I was mimicking someone else's life and

business model and even probably personality sometimes that wasn't actually mine right so I capped out

because I I was playing a role that I needed to play

and then the internet in terms of the the thing that I thought people saw of me of a brand then trapped me in it well

I have to keep pretending like I really want to do this because I've got people

paying me money to play this character on the internet so hindsight it was just mimicry just really successful mimicry

and there's a huge benefit to modeling but memory will always run you into the wall because mimicry gets you so close to the

person's personality beliefs and those things that it's always going to challenge what you actually believe and who you really are it's actually such a

subtle but important difference the idea of modeling versus mimicking yeah like I was talking to Dylan who runs all of our

content and I was like dude the things that we're trying to do right now have already been done like we don't have to

get Innovative and creative and go like we're pioneering something it's like dude let's look at garyvee let's look at the people that have been way ahead of

where we are and let's at least start modeling what they're doing what I'm not saying is let's take their top 10 thumbnails and go these are owls now

right I'm just going how do they shoot what angles uh what does it look like how what is that documenting versus

creating process look like but mimicking is interesting because I I would say like I um I have have had uh both past

and prison massive like dad issues right yeah so I think a lot of like coaching for me was Finding guys

that held some mentorship place in my life that I could then like hook my

horse to their carriage and go like I'm gonna follow this person I'm going to become more like this person and um that

served me really well in some instances you know where I'm like I don't think I ever got the blue blazer in the in the New York apartment you know like Sam but

but there was that sense of like I would listen to how Sam thought or talked and I would go oh I'm too expressive I need

to be more thoughtful I need to be more structured he was he was churning out 13 hour days and then planning tomorrow

today and doing all these different things and I would try them and it would be like wearing someone else's clothes like you know yeah

um and and yet there's so much value and modeling and so how do you think about it now like having gone through the The

Good the Bad and the Ugly because you and I still work like uh with coaches and we learn from people I think these

days I need to pay people less to get clean from them there are people I've never paid that I listen to their staff or there's a guy called Zane Lowe love

is interviews he's in the music space he's mentoring me and away from afar but how do you think about that idea of

modeling and mentorship now as opposed to the mimicking you were doing like how what's a healthy version of that look

like for you now this comes back to the reality of my life and the consequences piece which is like I'm a full-time dad

and I don't have any time so I have to have constraints I have to design from

constraints and when you are when you're mimicking you design From Desire or want to be

like that person or have the things that you perceive them to have I can no longer do that because I have to have

constraints of it so I have to design from a place of I need to design my model based on the reality of what I see

around me which is my kids and and the other things that are immediately important so it's been a force change

that I have to do those things because time is scarce energy is scarce so I

have to choose a model which works for me and there is no compromise on that because there's too many consequences of

compromising and I think when you mimic there's much less social there's more social because people always find you

out right yeah they always go you're just like so and so you're just like well the market the market doesn't reward you after a

time because you're like are you like them or you like this so you just you know it's it's not good business sense

because you end up being like everybody else in competition kills the prophets so I think about models now much more

from a way of I have to do this and this way to preserve these things because the

consequence consequence of me not doing attitude and I think one of the things I've learned is if you take advice the

what or the how from someone with a different why you can end up building a business that becomes more like a prison

and less and less like the how often do we see that oh dude this is what's fascinating is that like most of the

most popular entrepreneurial figures in our space who give the best the seemingly best business advice have

completely different goals from the 99 watching them so when you're watching someone who is trying to like literally

get into the upper echelon of any human financially in all of history and you're trying to make 10 000 a month

they might have great advice but it's coming from a different place and some of that advice is not for you because

you have different goals yeah if you're already a millionaire versus a billionaire I don't think people understand the the complete different

Stratosphere that lives in I think the stat is like well not the stat but the number is like uh a million seconds is 11 days ago a billion seconds is 32

years ago right so when people are taking advice from someone who's trying to have a thousand million dollars

it's such a different uh why it's such a different drive when we mimic someone

like that we might experience some level of progress and and even your business might grow but then you have a business

that you want to run away from more than you're excited to run because it doesn't align with your values and I think one

of the things that's been really helpful for me and I feel like I've been picking mentors and and models so much better uh

in this kind of last season is because I've been connecting with people with whys much more yeah yeah so does this

person share my values do they share my Outlook and Life to their share my worldview I'm not looking for 100 agreement I'm looking for alignment yeah

right I'm looking for a sense of if you give me advice I know it's coming from a place that you understand I'm a parent

or you understand I'm married or you understand I want to stay married or all of those things and so how have you gone

about picking people to learn from because I think that's a challenge whether you've got a credit card in hand and you're going to sign up to a program

or whether you are choosing to dedicate an hour of your your day kind of listening to people how do you think

about like the who do I learn from who do I give time to who do I model from it's it's all about the relative

constraints again like there are I know a lot lots of really smart mainly young dudes right you're one of them I don't

know lots of them you're a little bit different to the you know 25 year old Twitter Bros who are really smart yeah

really smart and they're doing the right things and the fundamentals are there but their life is different to mine it's

different to yours right so it's like do these people actually understand the

map's fine but the terrain is very different right so do people actually understand the terrain you're sitting on

in your on your real life because everything works every business model that you and I come

into contact with can be made to work you know in some cases they shouldn't you shouldn't want them

to work but everything works but the the the map and the terrain are different

things so for me it's like where is this person coming from and it is it does come back to those core principles now

and principles values you know and and increasingly these days track record

Because the Internet is distorted so much of what we see is true and false it's like

okay and we've linked also to financial success and performance with some level of higher morality right oh yeah well

I'm going to listen to them because they're rich right it's like that's very binary and a way to do it so I think I

think to answer the the question it's about nuances saying what's the circumstance of those people where's it

coming from you know what's the overall goal and vision of that and how do you how do you do that how do you do that in

a way that's applicable to me and and then living there you know I ran a

workshop the other day and it was I started with all the principles

I started with like how I think about things and where I come from and some very complicated

thanks it wasn't like hyper tactical and I'm Unapologetic about that they're like

I want to teach you the principles so you don't need me right I don't want trauma bonds and codependency

with clients right if you want to be like I got enough of my own I don't need

any more of them so so I come from a place of like I I don't want you to need

me and that I think in terms of like paying attention to people who are doing it that way and then paying attention to

how I'm doing it and if those things sync up then I'm generally on the right track you know what and I think it's the

reason why we haven't recorded these conversations I think the primary reason is we know that it would slightly distort and

dilute some of the things we say and some of the angles we have yeah because there's a performative element in all human nature yeah I'm trying to I'm

struggling to get comfortable in this chair I'm like I'm normally raising you directly we tumble ideas around and we we know each other's lives like very

very well in terms of the bigger picture you know I you won't even hear when I

arrived I'm sitting in there chatting to live in the and the boys and those things and checking out the chickens yeah those relationships are you know

they're Priceless and valuable to me because it's like I know you yeah I know the I know the business Dan you know I

like your posts on Facebook and watch your videos sometimes yeah on double speed yeah there we go but you know

who's the person yeah what are they doing what's their values you know what do they believe and we're

going to change along the way because stuff happens that you never you never see coming well I think this

is the interesting piece around this the space that we play in right online coaching Consulting marketing this

Creator economy whatever we want to call it we've seen it drastically evolve right you could have a funnel yeah and

that was it like maybe you would have a few posts on your Facebook page so someone clicked on

your ad you didn't look like a ghost but literally we were taught a model that worked really well which was you run an

ad to a stranger they click on a landing page the landing page is a big promise you you enter your details you come

through the video there's a rags to riches story there's a problem there's a solution there's an invite to a call one

in 20 people book the call and then one in five people close yeah right and that

can still work to a degree but one of the things that I'm seeing is the era of the personal brand is is upon

us it is we're we're content is now a filtering mechanism to go is this my

person because in 2016 if you're a consultant struggling with your clients you were desperate for Solutions and

there were very few around right Sam Evans pops up in your feeding goes how to get 42 clients in 69 days or whatever

it might be I can't remember his hook um and it was like it was new it was fresh I didn't do how we're going to get

clients automated now there are so many people who say the exact same things as us and we think if we just outspend them

in ads if we just out funnel them out follow up then we're going to win but the reality is is that people are

looking for depth with us I think now because they realize it's it wasn't business to business business to

Consumer it's human to human and now that there is ample competition and there's red ocean right it's about now

you know like that uh that saying I heard Kevin Kelly say recently it's like don't be the best be the only the model

if you always just be the best right it was just like how do you make the biggest claim how do you run the best ads and now it's like how do you create

a connection that no one else can replicate because it's you connecting with someone else yeah and I was talking

to a client yesterday and um he he uh sits up really quiet he said like the best decision I've made in the

last year of my business was hiring you but I hired you different to every other coach you've ever worked with every other coach I worked with was I had a

problem and they had a solution I asked myself before I hired you do I want to become more like Dan

and because I answered yes I've worked with you and it's been amazing because you're actually taking more I mean more

in the direction of the person I want to become not just the you know I'm a square Pig and that's a square hole and

like and so I think that's a really fascinating like Nuance to this whole conversation because I think there are a

lot of uh creators and consultants and coaches stuck in the old model that if I can just out Market if I can do a launch

or a five-day challenge without creating real deep intimacy with the audience

um they get stuck they can't outspend the fact that the people just don't trust them the way they used to what do

you think people should be thinking about whether it's doing a podcast whether it's writing posts on Facebook how do you think about cultivating that

sense of a personal brand now as opposed to you know you you're one funnel away yeah I think something that I've got

clients do recently doing is writing intention documents for themselves to to

uh a piece of self-discovery that gets down to what they really want and what is enough and not being shamed around that

you know an industry where everything's like seven figures this and seven figures that people coming back with you know six-figure goals

that they internally shame themselves for that despite that being like profoundly impactful on them and and

have constraints around it right yeah um and then in many cases they've shared those intention documents With Their

audience people want to know who you're becoming right they want to know where you're going because the true north only

now is the person behind it and we've understood that this filter of the Internet is just as as can

apply a filter that people can say and and do anything at the time but unless

they're unless you're very clear about who you're becoming and who you're following then that same mimic and sensitivity that you know that I fell

victim to in a successful Financial way is going to come to fruition because they they've followed they've already

got experience following people that they didn't want to become doing things that they didn't want to do

and they were attracted by The Glitz and now they want to know who are you where

do you think you're going and I'm okay with you reserving the right to change your mind as long as these basic principles and these these values are

are still consistent yeah because that's all people want they just want consistency with those things yeah they don't want the rug pulled from under

them say oh actually it was all a scam and it was all you know morally ambiguous and they don't really have

those values that's why we that's why we look at when people get caught doing things that are underhanded who have a a

high moral standing in society we have that look yeah you know because if you

undermine certain values then you know you can never be trusted again it's funny because again it comes back to

that idea of we give people credibility where they haven't earned it based on

status yeah this is funny in crypto right it's like people were surprised that crypto rug pulls happen yeah and

it's like you trusted this person because they had a hundred thousand followers on Twitter and had been tweeting for six months about this Amazing Project they're going to have or

maybe they had a personal brand uh as a successful Trader they launch something and then all of a sudden they they rug

you lose money they make money and you're like wait a minute I thought you were supposed to be this person but they'd not necessarily ever shown

themselves be a person who was uh had Integrity in this area it was just that they were successful and we made that

synonymous with trustworthy whereas like if you've been uh like I was asked yesterday how how many posts have you

put on Facebook do you think it's like man I mean maybe it averages out at one

a day for five years not including stories not including any other platform like it's it's you know a thousand plus

and I consistently have people who come into my world and in short term and

short times I become clients but the more common theme I see is I've been following you for years so I remember

when you finish being a youth pastor or like the compounding effect of the audience and the way that people trust you over time is just so invaluable and

I think like it's an interesting thing to observe because some coaches and Consultants are kind of caught with

their pants down going but I thought I could just run a five-day challenge I didn't want to really share my life

online and and I think it's um it's an interesting place because uh I'm really enjoying the journey but many people

aren't many people are going like I just want to run the ads and have the webinar funnel and I didn't sign up to be

anyone's Guru and it's like well you're a coach it kind of did yeah like if you're asking for thousands of dollars from someone like they need to know they

can trust you you can't just give them to a closer and a really awesome 45-minute sales pitch gets them in they

kind of want to know who they're doing business with and there's so many different choices why should they choose you yeah why should they work with you

and that's why uh vlogging and podcasts and and you know just content in general

I think is so powerful when it comes to building audience because it it's easy to pretend for a video

and it's really hard to keep the act up over weeks and months and years and dozens and dozens of pieces of content

yeah there is there is a barrier even to the way that

you've used the word audience there and I'll pick up on this there is a barrier to people getting started with the

belief that audience equals mass right right that audience equals a large amount of

attention if you take if you go back on my journey my first client I had an audience of one

they became a client yeah because of what factor trust right so in the

internet world where we're looking at um vanity metrics like views and likes and things that are on mass we over

index on the size of attention we think we need and we under index on trust and

that's that's what's happening in the rebalancing now towards the kind of Creator economy and the personal brand

and these things because we're trying to rebalance trust that you can grow a really big business an impactful one off

a tiny tiny audience if you have the highest levels of trust in the audience so something that stops people is this

idea that you need a big audience right because you only need an audience of one person in a relevant way who trusts you

to actually do anything yeah but and the more they trust you the more intimacy that's already been achieved so the more :03 implicitly you understand how you're useful to them on on the journey you go on so I think the idea of audience stops :09 a lot of people just as much as it kind of helps people you know because but we we go to audience and we look at the :16 mass Market yeah yeah everybody is in the kind of media business now to some extent everybody's streaming this and :23 you know reeling that and tick-tocking this I'll make myself like an augment :28 um because we've got an audience of something and it always makes me laugh how :34 much traction people can get with tiny little audiences who trust them yeah what's that belief that I don't have an :39 audience or a list and you're like do you know humans :47 and if if they aren't the right person they probably know the right person right it's all concentric circles yeah :53 it's all concentric circles out but we look at it as one big giant one as an audience and that dehumanizes everything :00 in it which just goes back to the point we're talking about before everybody's lost the humanity and marketing right :05 because it used to be person to person and then it went media you know printed media physical media and then it went :12 digital so we talk about an audience and we forget there's humans inside and it's Madness well we think about like a :18 market like a niche yeah like like they're all created equal like there's this just a hundred faces all lined up :25 and they all look the same yeah and I just need to sell to five of them because they're my audience they're :30 humans right yeah and the humanity go has gone out of marketing and and persuasion and these things because :37 everybody forgets there's a human on the other side of the action that you're taking and the message you were taking and that that concept has served me so :44 well in writing and creating for things and it's like the the interaction that :50 you get on and we've talked about this before the vanity metrics that you get on stuff that actually moves the needle :57 builds a relationship makes money in in those pieces as often there's an inverse correlation :03 you do the posts with 150 likes on your Facebook feed and it does nothing it :10 doesn't impact anybody because everybody just piles on to say good job yeah but you do the one that got four likes :17 and someone messages you and said oh my God that thing that you said there you really cut through to me and you got a a :24 person at a certain place at a time you actually touched a human but we've :30 become obsessed with the mass we've become obsessed with needing this audience thing when reality is everybody :36 has one yeah it's not about and I think a better way to even reframe it is like you don't need an auditory connection :41 with people and that that group of like better if we just got rid of the word yeah guys would have eliminated it now :48 we've got rid of it beep it out but uh I read the other day and it kind of summarized thoughts I'd had for a long :54 time which is like if you want to create a deep uh connection with the audience go narrow if you want to create a big :59 audience go wide and I think one of the things that's really fascinating to me is uh how much money I've made that :05 you've made from relatively small audiences like we have friends who are like I've got clients who are influencers yeah they have a hundred :12 times the amount of followers that I have and make a fraction of the money because they've gone wide and have a big audience but they don't have a deep :18 connection with the audience they have and that's where I think like that's so encouraging to me because for anyone who :24 is looking to get started or restarted or has lost momentum it comes back to the one like how can I write to help the :32 one person how can I shoot a video with one person in mind and when I am like my :37 YouTube videos now are averaging like 400 500 views my first YouTube video :43 that I posted a few months ago got 18 views and I remember picturing 18 people and like a coffee shop and I was going :50 like that's actually a lot of people if I was to be talking and they would have been listening and it's funny how like numbers again :57 take the humanity away because we often over inflate the importance of big :04 numbers and we underestimate the power of the the small audience that are intently leaning in if you have an :11 audience of 100 people who know like and trust you you can make really good money :16 right Kevin Kelly Kevin Kelly thousand true fans yeah it's such a powerful it's a hundred two thousand thousand thousand :23 thousand um but his whole thing was like if you are uh passionate about a band or if :28 you're selling T-shirts or like you know if you've got a thousand true fans um and so it's just fascinating to me :33 that like this isn't this is a conversation I think many people haven't had with themselves which is ultimately :39 why am I doing this because I was sold this dream of I run an ad I have a :45 webinar I have this coaching business and I'm living this laptop lifestyle and they've lost the why :50 and if you lose the service element of like you create content for an audience :56 to help people right a byproduct of that help is trust and a byproduct of trust :01 is purchase but if you don't actually keep the service part piece a part of it all you have is this funnel and metrics :09 and you actually struggle to gain traction yeah you're running funnels to generate numbers to look at kpis to :14 optimize click-through rates and then you wonder why you're struggling to create a sense of connection yeah and it's like that game of guess who you're :20 like does your person have glasses you're knocking them down it's like niches work the same way it's like well I'm looking for chiropractors on the :25 Internet it's like well let's just get personal like like what types of chiropractors who are they do you know anyone what do they important yeah what :32 do they want what do they need what's the thing that keeps them up at night all of that kind of stuff yeah um one of the things I wanted to talk about was :38 authenticity yeah I think that's probably the thing I've observed in both of us is the the more comfortable with :45 being in our own skin the better businesses we've created because we actually are not creating from a place :50 of insecurity and scarcity I want to be someone on the internet I want to look a certain way and it's been a sense of :56 like I know for me the physical the physical sensation I think of is just like :02 just a sense of comfort yeah in my skin what is that Journey been like for you over the last couple of years :09 um and was that very difficult was there a moment like where you're like throwing in the towel on the mimicry and you're :14 going I'm not going all in on James like what has that been like no I mean the only the only lightning strike :20 moment was when I realized I needed to go online when I was standing in the rain waiting for another Fairy like that's the only that only was like :28 screw it I've got to do something but everything else has been very Progressive I think two major events were moving to Bali because this place :36 what does it do to you I think it it puts you out in an environment that you're not used to and and is very much :44 I mean it's not it's it's not eat what you kill but it's very much you you realize you're outside of an of the :49 normal systems that you normally depend on and then separating from my wife last year which was like :55 oh I have to find myself :00 after being with someone for 25 years which is like who am I because you think you know :06 yourself but when you're in an intimate relationship you both have shared beliefs but you also :12 have beliefs that you need to believe for each other you compromise and and then there's trade-offs so that those :18 two things have have been the biggest catalysts along that journey of finding :23 who I really am because again for in the last nine months it's been around doing :29 the things I had to do and and we you talk about authenticity as well it's like the last nine months have been the :35 most brutal emotionally but also financially that I've had to endure for :40 almost a decade for obvious reasons um :46 but I've never felt more certain :51 of who I am and enabling me to operate in that because :58 I had to I have to like people depend on me so I think :05 when you get when the when it gets real you have to be authentic to yourself :13 otherwise you don't this is the choice that you've made right like when it gets real you don't have to :19 be authentic to yourself there's so many different parts you could have taken this year you know so why yeah we've talked this one :25 like what was it about this year that you were like big so like sorry to interrupt like no :31 guys so business is moving in a great direction for you now yeah but you could have just as easily gone like I'm just :37 gonna focus on being a dad and not that you're not doing that yeah but you're also like taking leaps and strides and :42 your health and things like that it's definitely something that you uh using to make yourself better but not everyone :49 makes that choice no like and that's a brutally hard choice because it's much easier to like :57 what has caused you to kind of approach it the way that you have this year I don't feel I have any choice and :04 that's what keeps me going and even hearing people say what a good job I'm doing and all those things and I get lots of Praise from lots of people makes :09 me uncomfortable so I'm still working on the being being grateful for who I am and :15 what I do and that and that kind of receiving book because I feel uncomfortable now just from you going :20 you could have done this another way and it could be much worse and it could be objectively :26 um so your faint praise is uh is always welcome but discomforting um :31 I I reconfirm stuff that I guess I knew I love being a dad :37 but I didn't know that I knew that right you know because my ex-wife and I had :44 different ideas of children and what what they'd what what impact they'd had on our lives and those kind of things :50 and I'm like no I actually love being a dad might actually love having a loving :55 relationship so it was like it was those things of those moments of clarity I also think :00 it's easier you know I'm 43 I think it's easier as :06 you get older because you just you've done more stuff and you get more of a sense of you've done and tried more :11 stuff so you get more of a sense of the the decisions you make but if because if you listen to yourself you you've got :16 enough instinct to know you know which which which where's your North Star and where to go so it's been brutally :24 difficult in the practice of doing the things I've done in the last year :30 but it hasn't been difficult getting myself to do them if that makes sense it does make sense and I think about like :37 how different this would look and feel if you were an accountant going through a really hard season yeah because you :42 rock up to work you've got your spreadsheets you've got your co-workers you can head down and you can just :48 almost hide we have a very public life yeah but :54 I did do that and I can afford to do that right I can afford to not work yeah :00 for a period of time right yeah so :05 why do I go back to working and why do I make the decisions I do because I gotta :11 I can't not do it so how did you navigate that that was what I'm trying to get to like because :16 there is there is a lot of professions that don't have us out publicly having this conversation it doesn't have us :21 posting content and coaching clients and being asked the hard questions so how did you navigate that almost feeling :27 like the plane is Airborne and you're changing both engines at the same time and so James is rocking up to a coaching :33 call and as opposed to previous seasons of Life probably doesn't feel like he's got it all together doesn't feel like he :39 knows which way is up how did you navigate that and actually work through that while you're still working on all :45 those things going on in your life I pretended I acted when I needed to that I had my :50 [ __ ] together to smooth the bits when I did actually have my [ __ ] together because I've got :56 my [ __ ] together but in in certain moments you definitely don't feel like it I had moments there where I was :03 I remember doing a call with a mutual friend of ours for an hour for an hour and a half in :08 January that I had to do and um he could tell that I was not not :14 in a good spot but most other people couldn't but which is like the skill of you know :22 playing a character on the internet so I think I navigated it through a mixture of gretton determination some acting and :29 then giving myself a lot of Grace and and also the sheer fact that I I didn't have to do a lot I had to unwind :36 and unravel a lot of stuff in a business that was starting to show signs of being you know a business that I thought I :43 wanted you know I was very leveraged and scaled and it wasn't necessarily dependent on the personal brand and some :48 of the things that I'm back to doing now but I think you know everything was a choice :53 and there were definitely times where I felt like I could curl up and sit in the hole :59 still are but you know there's there's a bigger picture of play I think the kids :04 and a relationship I'm in now that is like got a defined future in terms of :10 something that we're doing and going towards have been the most simple factor of that and then you know friends like :17 you and our friend Chris in terms of keeping me sane in terms of :22 like in in you've reminded me many times that everything's a choice you get to choose :28 every day you know those words sit with me a lot I remember when you said them to me you get to choose every day and um :34 I'm I'm lucky that I've built a lot of ways to make choices I guess if like you :40 said if I wasn't if I was had a job and I was an accountant and I had to go nine to five :45 in those things I don't know how those people get through it and a lot of mainly men don't :50 yeah get through it at this time of life because it feels catastrophic the end of a long relationship with kids and :56 intertwined and all those things so it's not been easy and it still isn't :03 but I think it it gives you the it gives you the reality check :09 of the lived reality that you're actually in because I think these days we can live a fantasy land for a long :15 time until the rugs pulled from under us and did you feel like that's where you were like was it was were you living :22 authentically a year ago like two years ago was there any sense of autopilot that you that looking back you're like :29 no I actually wasn't create like because I I think about this in terms of business models as well yeah like there :34 was certain periods of time where for me and my my business I was just following :40 Alex romozy I was like freaking it was like Braveheart he was on the horse we were charging four and we were you know :46 we were warring against scale or whatever and um and so I was just blindly just doing stuff and it wasn't :53 until they have these like Rock Bottom moments or these like I would never forget going to La December 2021 and the :59 best way I could describe it is my body hit like low battery mode it was like what why and uh it was through those :05 periods where I it kind of like woke me up a bit and so was there any sense that there's like things were on autopilot or :11 there was like the playing of a character anything like that always I want to come back to what you just said because I I was on the inside of that as :18 well so I want to give perspective on your side if I can go for it but um :23 the in hindsight yes there was there was just that curse of :29 Competency that allowed everything to just to keep rolling on despite a feeling of disease that kind of :36 permeated large Bits Of My Life that this is this it was kind of the a :44 feeling for a decent part you know of the last of the last year last a couple of a year or two ago :51 and in that period so there was definitely things that I ignored but I :57 could put them away because I do have a high pain threshold I have a :03 tolerant I have the tolerance of lots of entrepreneurs have because we can tolerate things that other people can't :08 and we just normalize it and I saw you go through that I saw you knowing that you needed to :14 stop and slow down and and focus on yourself and you were saying to me at the time :19 that you knew you did it but you didn't feel able to because :25 we were both playing characters of we need to do this because there's some :32 higher power you know mummy and daddy coaching issue or Mentor you know Mentor issues to say :38 what would they think of us if we pulled the plug on this 13-person business what would they think of us if we pulled the :44 plug on this 25-year relationship and 15-year marriage so :49 all the evidence is there for us and we we often know :55 you know it's the difference between knowing and knowledge right yeah we know our bodies are telling us yeah like the :01 level that I've talked about with you you know about my sleep issues and those kind of things for :06 most of last year I sleep like a baby now like most of the :12 last year I didn't yeah there's this like karmic Force you know like you know waking you up at three o'clock in the :18 morning telling you that something's off yeah and I just ignored all the signs yeah and I think you you recognize bits :24 of that that there was stuff there that was like this is the signal this is a signal this is it's not noise yeah just :31 to to to say that something needs to change it's identifying the changes is the biggest challenge :37 and we can't do that ourselves we sometimes fear is very difficult anyway :42 it sometimes fear looks like wisdom right so when you have a team :47 and it might not even be like oh what will people think it's like these people have jobs and if I don't have this :54 business they don't have a job I'm morally obligated to do that right yeah and so for me there was also that layer :00 of like I was so concerned about everyone else's health and safety it's :05 that metaphor of who's whose mask do you put on first for me I felt so indebted :11 to these people on my team that I felt uh indebted to the clients that entrusted their hard-earned money into :17 this business model that I'd created that I was like if I step out of this model I might be serving myself but I'm :24 doing a disservice to everyone else and even as it turns out that's not what happened people found better jobs :31 clients love the transition right but the reality is of like you you live with that weight and it's it it's I don't :38 want to oversimplify it but so much of human nature and so much of the decisions we find ourselves making really comes down to are we being :45 influenced by external forces or are we being our intentions moving us internally to actually do things and :52 make things happen and so like the authenticity Journey for me has been really interesting because I stripped it :58 back to to nothing and I was kind of playing around with those ideas of like okay so you have all the money in the :04 world what do you want to wake up and actually do and as I was giving myself permission with without putting the :09 expectations of like I but I run a team of all these people and but I'm working with Alex and you know what will he :14 think it became so freeing because I was like man I actually think I'm really :19 clear on on who I am and who I want to be and I'm not running a business that reflects that but it took me deciding :26 that my health was most important that my passion was most important that I I couldn't just keep upping my my pain :33 threshold and keep enduring more to for everyone else's sake I had to like really look after myself not just from a :40 physical mental emotional health objective but but for the longevity of my life I'm gonna die at some point like :47 I have no idea when my life is going to end I hope when it does I can look back on the seasons that I've been living at :54 going like I've been living true to who I am yeah like I've been playing this like you know mimicry of trying to be :00 this coach or this coach but I was living the best way I damn could to be Dan Bolton to be the truest version of :06 who I am and that became It came it came because I hit the pain threshold of like :13 I can't be this other person that other people that I feel other people need me to be it sounds like this year's kind of :19 been formative for you in that way as well yeah yeah again you you just can't you know again the consequence piece of :26 like if I am and continue to be that or if I continue to pretend then the the :31 cost is coming into view which is probably what you felt as well you know if I keep doing this :37 bad things are going to happen and I think authenticity I again it's one of those words that :45 has kind of been bastardized a bit because authenticity means to lots of people just like share stuff on the :52 internet you know to manipulate people yeah whereas true Earth intensity is actually living :59 your own life but also understanding that evolves yeah like the Dan Bolton of today :06 is not even the Dan Bolton even tomorrow yeah right but they're still the same they're still the same you know entity :12 yeah and going forward that this person is authentic if you're evolving authentically based on the you know a :18 small number of things that are important to you then it's still you yeah but this is what I find interesting :23 about evolution is that we I :29 remember having a conversation with Liv a few years ago and I was like I just want to become a :35 new Dan Bolton I want to become like Dan Bolton 2.0 and then I sat there I thought about it and I was like :41 am I becoming new Dan Bolton or am I becoming true Dan Moulton now funny play on words but like for me what's really :47 interesting is like actually if I think about who I was as an 18 year old I'm more reflective of the 18 year old now :54 and this season than I have been for the last five years because I deviated so far from the values of the vision that I :00 had for my life now this is of course not true at every age I can't look back at Dan Moulton at seven literally dead :06 multiple seven wanted to be a backup dancer in the Spice Girls 100 True got my mum to call the uh travel agents to :14 figure out how much it would cost to fly to the UK like you took action you're an action taker The Action preseason :21 already believe in my ability to figure it out but when we look at overall I'm gonna make that dream come true for you one day I promise please bring back the :29 reunion um when we look over the like our lives there is actually so much breadcrumbs as :34 to who the true version of us is yeah definitely so Evolution we think about it in terms of the self-creation but :40 it's almost like the self-discovery of the person that was always there I think Michelangelo um uh carved David is that is that who :47 did it was it Leonardo da Vinci one of the one of the greats right he carved David out of the Rock and he said David was always there I just had to chip away :54 everything that was not him and and I think like the process of evolution is almost like that that it's not as if you :59 and I are blank slates right now and we go who do we want to be I mean there's a level of freedom to that but it's almost like who have we always been that we've :07 been ignoring this whole time like like the idea for me building my business around creation now dude I grew up :14 playing music all I wanted to do was play music as an adult that was the only thing I dreamed of doing was music drama :20 Then I then I spent almost a decade of my life where the main part of what I did was speaking and creating messages :26 yeah and then I started an ads agency and I was just an ad accounts all day and then I built a team and I was just :32 in meetings all day there was no point where I was like this is the version of Dan that I feel like I'm supposed to be I just lost sight of that and it's it's :40 so tough that it takes really low moments for us to get there but whatever :45 it takes for us to get there it's almost less about imagining and it's more about remembering :52 it's more about remembering the person we've always been and coming back to that the the interesting like one story :58 I told recently was you know the pervasive childhood memory for me was Lego :03 so I would get Lego and I would assemble it and I'd immediately disassemble it and then make it into lots of different :10 things that were my own creations and it's interesting I'd done the same thing in business right I'd immediately :16 learned something and then disassemble it and make it slightly mine to get a result from it and I still do that to :22 this day that that innate okay there's a pattern here there's a system to follow :28 but in the process of building that system I think I've seen a better way to do it I'm going to do it on my own and :35 again I ignored that or so many times where I overplayed that as you know as a :41 one-trick pony of being I'm just going to be a derivative of that and it is largely remembering that find something :48 you know stand on the shoulders of giants but then you know in a from a creative sense down on the shoulder of :54 Giants and then you know choose choose add your own Unique Piece to it and then :59 choose the path because then you'll be as far away from a synthetic poor :04 derivative of the of the of the core thing yeah and it's funny because I think we either talked about it :10 yesterday or recently where you were talking about your business model right now in the business model in one :16 sentence is do stuff I want to do is that is that accurate yeah so make cool :21 [ __ ] so why do we have a complicator like like why is it that people go :27 through all of the seasons of like being someone they're not and all that kind of stuff is it that we just don't know is :32 it that we feel like we haven't given ourselves permission for it we don't have the skills like because I feel like I'm in the same season I only want to do :39 stuff I'm excited to do and it's super profitable super fun and I'm like why :44 did I not do this not only that the crazy thing is people admire and respect :50 it much more than any other action because they're like it is so obvious that someone is living their own lives :57 yeah and that is freedom yeah right so we talk about Freedom as the you know the highest pursuit of humans and these :03 things which I believe and when they see someone doing what they really genuinely :09 want and loving it people are like I want to follow this model right :15 and you can be so uncompromising on that yeah like I am so uncompromising now I :21 am so kind of strong boundaries around things that I do yeah and but in the container :29 is coaching word in the container of what I make it's going to be the best thing it possibly is for what it you :35 know what it says on the turn and people people admire and respect that yeah because they're like that's Freedom he's :40 doing what he wants yo I think Joseph Campbell says we're not so much searching for meaning in life as we are :46 for the experience of being Fully Alive and then people wonder why as a stressed :51 out coach they're struggling to get clients but it's like if I'm signing up to a coach who looks like they're :57 miserable and stressed and that they hate the business that they're in yeah in what world am I going to be feeling :04 more Fully Alive working with them than another coach who feels like you're actually looking at their business and :10 you're going are they having this thing called fun that's crazy and that's been interesting for me as I've been creating :16 content more in this year as I've been burned everything to the ground simplified things people will say things :21 like I really like your videos don't really know why I feel such a connection with you I really like your energy or :28 something to that effect and for me this marketing psychology and all sorts :33 of stuff um and no doubt I have skills that are undergirding that I've built over the last few years the biggest thing is like :39 I'm only creating videos I want to create yeah I refuse to create anything I'm not excited about so I we have done :47 no YouTube research like when with launching the YouTube channel around like best Trends I'm like I want to talk :52 about things I want to talk about and I want to talk about them in a way that I'm excited to talk about them I don't want to just create content for the sake :58 of it I don't want to create a funnel for the sake of it I don't want to create anything for the sake of it but most people that's where they live from :04 they live from that energy of need and I have to rather than the energy of I get to yeah yeah and that's where I think :10 there's the big shift that that a lot of people could make I think it could and I think there's a whole industry that's going to prevent them right which is the :17 one we're in right because I think I think a huge amount of people buy coaching or what is cool coaching now in :23 terms of the group coaching environment because of trauma bonding right they're looking for an authority figure in their life because they were unfulfilled from :30 the authority figures that were you know presented to them in early life and you've alluded to this :35 um and there's a huge fear of like you know Annoying mummy or Daddy because you don't follow the system right and that :41 and that as then injected learned helplessness into the actions of people who are scared to :47 move on their own and scared to do what they really want in case there aren't casts from the group so we've got we've :53 got mummy and daddy issues trauma bonding and tribe Dynamics or like convalescing :58 around keeping people stuck yeah but just enough people can mimic the business model of the person they're :04 learning from or the the skills or whatever it is to be successful for that to for the that scheme to continue yeah :12 but the the failure the failure rates of the promise result in this industry are :17 disgusting they're single-figure percentages because the promises got so big and so ridiculous and the guarantees :23 got so out of this world thanks Mr homozy the purple book over there yeah yeah you know or you don't :28 pay um but it's acceptable to have like single figure kind of success things :34 yeah but the interesting thing about what both you and I have done is like not measured success just on money right :40 we're we're talking to people and saying what lights you're out do you want a fun business do you want to do it with these :46 yeah because you can have profit as well yeah but it's a byproduct of these things and we talk about profit we talk :52 about money we talk about all these things because they're important to get freedom and they're Downstream from these things and they enable resources :57 enable us to do things but I think the interesting thing that the interesting Journey both you and I are on right now :04 is that we're not doing it when we're not making money that's compromising the fun and the ease and the values and :09 those things yeah and that's what people resonate with they're like because money is actually :15 people hate that money is actually easy yeah right the other stuff is difficult oh yeah but if it it's got to be the :23 right money it's got to be the right school board and that's what people are looking for and that's that's the :28 healthy byproduct of a sophistication of a Marketplace as well because people someone said to me in a message this :35 morning I'm not looking for another Guru right now and I was like you know tongue-in-cheek :40 back saying thank you for tangentially calling me a guru what are you you know and then just start asking questions :46 like what do they want in those things yeah and and none of the questions like how much money do you want to make yeah it's like what are you doing right now :53 what are you enjoying what are you hating what do you want us to look like yeah you know and what's meaningful to :58 you in terms of profitability and those things from where you are yeah you know in many cases the hard thing that people only go of is :05 that to change business models and change some of the things that they need to change because they're keeping them trapped yeah there is a period where you :11 go backwards before you go forwards you know I've had to go backwards before I went forwards you know and and recent :16 history yeah um but I needed to do it for lots of reasons but I also had :22 accepted that that was going to be the case that I could I could take the L's for a few months to get back on you know :28 to to actually do and be inside something that I loved I think like this :34 kind of brings me to the word of the theme that I had for this year which is :39 this whole idea of conscious yeah and I hate that in the way that it gets hijacked by the spiritual entrepreneurs :44 of like we work with conscious coaches and I understand we're repurposing all these words :51 idea of like I want to build a life based off intention I want to be awake at the wheel not :59 asleep at the wheel not on autopilot and I think like my hope is for anyone :04 like listen to this conversation that they realize that without knowing all the details it :11 starts with the decision am I going to try and like I was listening to someone the other day that was saying the opposite of being :17 yourself is fitting in because fitting in requires you to be someone that you think the tribe needs :23 you to be to fit in well yeah literally it's literally taking the shape of something to to make it fit exactly :30 right and so most of us have spent our lives being professional fitting inner :37 is right we have we we've managed the perception of other people we want to go to the event we don't want to be the odd :43 one out we don't want to be at the the metaphorical lunch table by ourselves we :48 want to be in a tribe and what that often means is we have to sacrifice who :54 we are to be what we think the tribe needs us and wants us to be and for me I :59 know it sounds like it's for you it comes down to this decision you make which is that Am I Living For others am I going to live for myself and it :06 doesn't mean am I living a life of selfishness or selflessness the most selfless thing you could do is live a :11 life that's fully expressing yourself yeah in service of others yeah but it's :16 not even good strategy because being a freaky weirdo gets you the most attention like fitting fitting in is like the :23 least profitable thing that anyone can do get everybody's doing it but because it's not for the reasons of strategies :28 for the reasons of you know self-worth it's for the reasons of self-esteem yeah so it doesn't even make any sense on the :35 in the game that people are trying to play yeah or fitting it because standing out :41 is the most profitable thing you can ever do in today's society and isn't it ironic it's like in Pursuit like that's :49 what I found with with the season I'm in is the less I focus on money and the more I focus on doing stuff I want to do the more money I make Yeah Yeah the more :56 fun I have the more it makes like to the point where we talked about this yesterday I was like it should feel like it's cheating yeah yeah right if like :02 success but it should feel like it's cheating yeah and sometimes I look around and go this must be cheating yeah I've had a :09 couple of days this week whereas like this has got to be cheating yeah I did that I did that much and I got :16 this much back yeah across multiple domains you know financial and you know meaning and all those things like this :22 feels like cheating well this this kind of just comes back to this idea of self-awareness who am I what am I :28 passionate about what are my skill sets what kind of Life do I want to lead and then what business will help me achieve :34 those things and I think if people ask those questions uh like we have you come up with some really hard :40 answers sometimes which is yeah like I'm making I have a business that is exists to pay the bills or fuel the ego or deal :48 with the insecurities rather than one in this expression of my for lack of it's where my soul's work my calling like why :55 I feel like I'm on Earth and I just think for me this year has been a Line in the Sand :00 year of I am no longer doing life on autopilot I'm not trying to be someone :05 else uh that I I feel like I need to be I want to be the most authentic expression of myself still figuring it :12 out I haven't figured it out finding my voice still doing all that stuff but it came from the conscious decision of like enough is enough and I think like that's :19 where a lot of people I think need to get to that point and unfortunately sometimes it takes a lot of pain to get :24 there but if someone can manufacture the point of clarity of just like I'm not going to wait until I you know :31 um go through a really hard season of separation or hit low battery mode and burn out and all that but they just pull :36 themselves aside and just like get really clear on what they want I think it'll be a huge gift to so many people yeah I think :44 the pain I think pain is essential but I think the suffering is optional and :50 that's why I think these ideas of mentorship of Community are so critical and leadership are so critical to now :57 because they don't don't remove but they mitigate an :03 ease of suffering right you know what's a terrible analogy I'll go for a :08 terrible analogy if you go on lift weights and you do we're both done CrossFit you do Fran :15 right yeah so you do doing frown on your own and doing it in a room full of :21 people are different things right they both hurt but one you've got to mentally :27 suffer and motivate yourself the other one there's people around you music status you know all those things and :32 this is where I think the the concepts of Community mentorship are just there not to take the pain away because the :39 difficult questions must be asked and the work must be done but they can definitely mitigate some of the suffering and that's what I'm in it for :46 I'm not trying to take pain away the same as parenting I'd love to take all the pain away from my kids but I also :51 know that they have some dire consequences for them and I think most parents feel like that to some degree it'd love to not make them fall over and :58 stumble and have horrible things happen to them but the lessons that you know the lessons they get from them are :03 Priceless yeah and I see the same as like with people and clients and ideas and these things is like if you're there :11 and you can mitigate the suffering and make the pain worthy because there's a good why behind it because they're :17 doing they're they're inflicting the right pain on themselves then that's what that's what I'm here for anyway :23 yeah and that and that is the distinction is it's not about is entrepreneurship can be hard even in :30 the midst of it's not a question yeah it's going to be but even in the fun stuff it's like we we I mean :36 entrepreneurship is hard because you you never live up to your potential so even if things are easy on the model side :42 you're never satisfied in the sense that there's always more in the tank there's always more that can be accomplished and :47 so like heart is uh difficult because you've got to get skills and traits all those types of things but you want the :54 smart type of pain not the foolish type of pain you know and I think that's where a lot of people get stuck is they :00 are suffering unnecessarily like I only forget like messaging almost a few years ago I said :07 what do you think of 75 hard and I'll never forget to sit back he said most entrepreneurs mistake difficulty for :13 Progress yeah oh if this is hard the hardest something is the bitter it must be for me right yeah but there is a good :19 training session in the gym and there is a stupid training session in the gym right there is one where you get :25 inadequate recovery where you over stress the muscles where you train so much to failure that you're not in a uh :32 point of growth you're now injured right and that's where I think most people live in that Redline State yeah :38 um but it does have to be that way it doesn't but I do think that you need to go there a couple of times to understand :44 it doesn't need to be that way you've got to touch a few stoves to know that you have I I'm convinced you have to I :50 think we can model I think we can learn I think we can take shortcuts and I think the informational and the and the :56 the connection Advantage we have in the world we live in is yeah ridiculous yeah :01 like what a time to be alive but I don't I don't think you can make progress without you know as you say :08 touching a few stoves yeah I don't I don't think you make your own true progress to understand your preferences :13 yeah because we both know people that we love that have business that have :19 businesses and lives that we would hate but they love them yeah so we both they needed to go through the :25 Journey To Build That Life and if we'd gone through it we would have just had a different path yeah so :32 yeah I think you need to go through you need to do stuff to find out that you don't want to do stuff or which which :38 stuff you want to do more specifically yeah you gotta you got to do seasons of uh not being yourself to find out who :45 you are yeah yeah and I think you know as we sit here now today I'm pushing a :51 lot of stuff very hard and I've shared with you you know in the last few days I'm like if I continue to push all the :56 domains I'm pushing and now I'm pushing a lot of things physically I'm putting up pushing a lot of things mentally :02 um you know financially and and with ambition that if I continue to push on all these domains as hard as I'm pushing :07 on all these I'll burn out so soon I'm going to need to make a decision on what's the next season but I'm pushing :14 everything hard to get to a point where I can Coast on a couple of things yeah while I while I push the next thing in :19 the leg up and that to me I wouldn't have had that wisdom even relatively recently it was just :25 like push at all costs and Redline out because I've got a high capacity and I think a lot of people fall into that :30 trap because they've got a high capacity they're always trying to find it so they'd go and burn out and try and do do everything push everything run after :37 everything yeah I'm doing 75 hard and I'm going to add a million to my Revenue in the next month and you know I've got :43 five girlfriends and whatever whatever the you know whatever their focus is but there are seasons of like you can push :48 everything but it's about momentum it's about achieving momentum in those and then allowing those things to have their :55 own momentum so then that they then serve you whether it's your body your mind your relationship your your business or whatever it is agreed bro :02 we've been at this for a while this has been a joy have we I don't know an hour and something hour and a half something :07 like that oh my goodness um it's been a great time uh first of many :12 um I know you've launched something recently and you're kind of like going back to something you used to love doing a lot daily emails swipe my :19 marketing.com yeah is that what you like the domain yeah I own so many I just had to choose one when you do when you :26 brought it up I was like this is so random but you you as in you I didn't know you owned it and all of that well :31 my just a little bit of thinking behind that it was like I got sick of you know the I didn't like the whole you know :36 three Secrets thing I'm like a full sin person so I'm like if you want it use it take it I'm gonna give everything away :43 and you know give away all the insights and show you behind the scenes and then make a lot of the things that the :49 digital products are making super accessible like I just did a hundred dollar thing um and if you want help I'm here yeah :55 you know so to me it was like congruent with where I'm at with like :00 15 odd years of doing stuff online and making offers and doing seeing millions :06 of them literally that it was like I know a lot of stuff I'm going to share a lot of stuff if you swipe it great if :13 you want some help cool yeah let's go it felt like it felt like the right :20 thing at the right time yeah and the thing I want to land on because it's reflective of authenticity of finding :25 the right model is you're starting up a daily email or a mostly daily email yeah so talk about why that was important for :31 you to come back to that and of how can people get on that yeah so swipe mymarketing.com :36 sign up writings writing's been a practice for two decades I write :42 lots of words helps me think um daily email is Supernatural and :49 Supernatural very natural for me to do so I can write I can write a couple of :54 things a day and put and put words out really easily and it's always the things I can do consistently are the most :00 important things and what's my highest leverage activity was always the the choice of Max so I sent an email every :05 day I make an offer every day you know if people want my help if you want to buy something great if they want to :11 unsubscribe great all the offers are on the table so for me it was like what can I do consistently what's my highest :17 leverage activity I don't do a ton of video or a ton of you know other media writing in the word is my thing and so :23 what's my highest leverage activity and and how do I put that out and it's back to back to email back to sending :28 regularly um and it's great you get you know after being on social for so long you get a :35 depth and connection and a privacy and an intimacy that you don't necessarily get in DMS which are short you have :41 people writing War and Peace coming back to you like this is this and this I've been through this I've been through this I want to do this does this even exist :47 yeah and you can have proper conversations and and a different pace yeah you know the online world is like :54 literally something is forgotten the moment it's out there whereas with email and and these things it's it's an ongoing conversation and a depth yeah :00 and at a time in my life when the depth matters much more than the width yeah so it's the right thing at the right time I :07 love it it's also that self-awareness piece right I was we've been hanging out all year more than normal because we're :12 living uh not together but basically together and um you were talking about writing this kind of ebook I think :18 you're putting out I don't know if you're still putting it out but um and then I was out of this guy called danco and he's like writing online and so I :23 went through this period of like I'm just gonna write yeah miserable I was like staring at a blank page of being :29 like I hate this I love putting together quick posts but I'm video audio that's my thing yeah and so I love that you've :35 gone back to that because I've I've seen your enjoyment factor of business go up dramatically we were like wait a minute there's this thing I used to do that I :42 enjoy doing I stopped doing it and now yeah yeah and so I think that's just a such a simple piece of like what :50 do you enjoy doing look at the breadcrumbs of the past and and do more of the stuff you enjoy doing that's a reflection of who you are and less of :56 the stuff that's not yeah but can I share because this is really insightful for people that I'm still jealous of you :02 having a YouTube channel and a Dylan and all these cameras and this and those things and I could subtly convince :09 myself that I should be doing all this right despite that not being my highest leverage and biggest opportunity yeah :14 you know the thing I should be doing I get it reverse that never goes away I feel exact same way in Reverse self-awareness :20 is like because that never goes away I'm like damn cool man his thumbnails are sexy and :28 Dylan Dylan and then I'm like :33 I'm just gonna write my email I think I think the same way I literally think about how much better my thinking would :39 be if I wrote every day and I don't get me wrong I'm right often on Facebook but they're not like posts or emails or well :45 thought out it's like literally stream of Consciousness no editing posted and it's that funny thing of like we always look at the business model of :51 someone else that we don't have that they have that we convince ourselves must be better than it is for them and :57 what I love is you look at Joe Rogan who's never shot a reel in his life who's never ridden a Blog who doesn't :04 write Facebook posts and he just does podcasts and he does what he does and he's Joe Rogan and it crushes and so :12 it's not about doing the right thing it's about doing the thing that's the most right for you and that will work :18 the best and create the deepest connection and the best business um good place to laying the plane I :24 appreciate your time I appreciate your friendship um I I am looking forward to many more :30 of these conversations yeah and I just thanks for taking the time thank you
