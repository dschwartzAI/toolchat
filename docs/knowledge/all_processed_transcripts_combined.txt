## Building a 1000 True Fan Audience

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of building a loyal audience of "true fans" who consistently engage and purchase, emphasizing intentionality and quality over quantity. He outlines three core strategies for audience growth: borrowing, building, and buying.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** Morning peeps! How are you all doing? Awesome. I will share the doc as usual. Unfortunately, I have to take off copying permissions on my trainings. The rampant thievery has got to the point of ridiculousness.  The docs and recordings are there to use, and also posted inside skool. So, 1,000 true fans – the template for finding a thousand true fans who buy from you daily. This isn't just about growing an audience, though I'll use that word a lot. It's about nurturing an audience that actually does things. A lot of audiences don't do much. They'll follow, watch, applaud, but they won't interact or buy. Building an audience these days needs to be intentional. If you're intentional, you don't need a huge audience. Just like with offers, if we're intentional and understand the dynamics, we don't need that many clients. This is about doing it the smart and efficient way. Today, I'll talk about the three ways to grow. I'll touch on capturing and communicating, but next week I'll dive deep into owning and communicating with an audience to get them to do things. I'm over-delivering on the templates – we've got well over 100 that are easily replicable. Use the themes, principles, and insights.  Last week of August, I'll do an open Q&A.


## The Importance of Creation in Audience Building

**Summary:** James Kemp stresses that creation is fundamental to audience growth. Strategy provides guardrails, but creation itself fuels connection and allows for the transition to a creator economy where creativity is rewarded.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** I want to set the scene: you *must* create to communicate. Without creation, none of this works. I'll give you templates and ways to do things, things you can replicate, but you must create on top of those. *How* you create, *what* you create, *who* you create for, and *where* – those are the strategy. Strategy requires thought, but not too much.  Many get trapped in "what's the best platform?" Those are just decisions. Execute on them. Creation is the energy. Strategy sets you free to create.  The online world has accelerated the transition from the knowledge economy to the creator economy. You're rewarded for your creativity. People look for that freshness and energy. Creating true fans, not just an audience, is through communication that connects. The Internet allows us to connect in new ways. Connection shows you understand them. Demonstrate usefulness and a vision that only a leader can have.  Building an audience is your biggest asset. A friend retired three years ago, hasn't created anything new, and makes over a million dollars a year selling other people's stuff. He has an audience, a list, connection, and trust. If people know, like, and trust you, you'll never lack opportunity. Your audience evolves with you. I've gone from traditional consulting to e-commerce to lead generation. Some have been with me through it all. Built properly, it's an asset that lasts. There are three basic phases. Today, we'll dig into the three ways to build, then discuss capturing, communicating, and repurposing.


## Three Core Strategies for Audience Growth

**Summary:** James Kemp introduces the three core strategies for audience growth: borrowing (leveraging other people's audiences), building (creating content on social media), and buying (using paid advertising).  He emphasizes that relationships are key and take time, and each strategy has its own skill requirements and trade-offs.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** There are only three ways to build an audience. There's no fast *and* good way. The key factor is relationship, and relationships take time. The more deliberate you are, the faster it happens. Each domain has skill requirements and trade-offs. All are useful, the mixture is up to you. Some exclusively use ads, some borrow audiences, some are purely organic. The balance depends on trade-offs and skills. All require investment – time, skills, or money. Reps are required. I'll give you a basic plan with reps for short, medium, and long-term returns. Think long-term.  The three strategies are: *Borrow*: Someone already has your future client. They trust that person. Transfer that trust to you. Borrow their attention. *Build*: Social media is publishing. Be discovered. Create content. *Buy*: Buy attention. Buy audience quickly. Build depth and relationship. Define next steps.


## The Importance of Skill and Usefulness in Audience Building

**Summary:** James Kemp argues that a lack of opportunities to borrow an audience often reveals a lack of skill or usefulness.  He emphasizes the importance of investing in your craft and demonstrating your value.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** I'm going to be blunt: a deficiency of opportunity in any of these categories exposes a lack of skills or usefulness. Borrowing an audience is the way to build a high-quality audience. If you can't get in front of someone else's audience, you haven't invested enough in your craft or demonstrated your value. I could turn up anywhere weekly because I've invested and demonstrated, and people want to hear me. This builds a high-quality audience and doesn't require huge leads, as people are pre-qualified. True fans trust you. Trust has to be transferred. Choose partners that cross over but don't compete directly.  Don't try to steal clients.  Demonstrate value.  Calls to action are overrated. Borrowing an audience fits into two categories: teaching and sharing.


## Borrowing an Audience: Teaching

**Summary:** James Kemp explains that teaching is a powerful way to borrow an audience.  By teaching something valuable and timely, you demonstrate your expertise and build trust with a new audience.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** The first category is *teaching*. Teach something they haven't seen or that you're known for. My friend Taki runs a coaching program. We disagree on some things, but agree on many. I'm an easy person for him to invite to teach his people. I've taught his groups offer creation, book funnels, and what's working now. I was opening the kimono, giving his people exclusive insights. Demonstrations of what's working now are easy. "Hey, I'm doing this, it's working well, want me to show your people?"  That's great, virtually or in person. A downloadable resource is a bonus, not required. If you teach well and demonstrate value, people will reach out.  Teaching what's working now has the highest response rate. It's the fast lane from audience member to customer to client.  Turning up might be scheduled or impromptu. Allow audience interaction and Q&A. You're not there to sell, you're there to teach and demonstrate. The better you do that, the more likely you are to sell.  You can get clients weekly this way.  I know someone who exclusively does this.  It works because of trust transfer.  You inherit trust from the person who puts you on their stage.


## Borrowing an Audience: Sharing

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the second way to borrow an audience: sharing what's working now. This often requires permission but can be highly effective in demonstrating your expertise and relevance.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** The second way is *sharing*. Demonstrate what's working now. This often requires permission. I've done this in Taki's program and others. "Hey, this thing's working right now." It makes you relevant and timely. You often need permission, especially if it's not purely altruistic. Show them everything, demonstrate insight, show exactly what you're doing in real time. This is a high-rep, high-return strategy. Getting on other people's stages compounds quickly. Reach out weekly and offer to teach. Someone has your ideal client right now. This is how I'd build a small, engaged audience. The crossover will be contextually aware. You could reach a few hundred people a year and get a significant number crossing over, with trust transfer, willing to buy. It's the way to build quality.


## Building an Audience: Choosing the Right Platform

**Summary:** James Kemp advises on choosing the right social media platform for building an audience, emphasizing the importance of discernment and understanding the realities of each platform's algorithm. He stresses consistency over platform choice.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** The second way is *building* an audience. This is much slower and getting more difficult. We need a way to be discovered. I'll break this into two parts: platforms (guardrails) and what to say. Choosing a platform requires discernment. What's natural for you? What are the realities of each platform? Here's the reality of algorithms: to grow, you need to be discovered. You need to grow outside the same pool of people.  Algorithms change. *Facebook* (personal profile) is friend-centric. It doesn't allow for much discovery. 90% of my profile views are friends. It has limits for growth, but allows for deeper connection. *Instagram* is highly discoverable and visual. 93% of my post views are non-followers. But it's visual, requiring higher production. *LinkedIn* is highly targeted, but low interaction. People aren't on there frequently. It has a low decay rate. *YouTube* is low discovery, long lifetime, but high production.  Content lasts for years, versus hours or days on other platforms.


## Building an Audience: Content Strategy and Repurposing

**Summary:** James Kemp dismisses the idea of a "best" platform, advocating for consistency and creating content for a primary platform then distributing it to others. He suggests a simple copy-paste strategy and shares his own approach.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** The worst idea is that there's a "best" platform. There isn't.  There's just a best platform *for you*. Trust and attention can be built anywhere. Social networks have real humans.  Create for a primary platform, distribute to others. The best social media strategy is copy-paste. Publish on one, take it to another. I screenshot Facebook posts, put them over random videos, and run them as Instagram Reels. They get 3,000 organic views, 90% new people.  The best platform is one you can create consistently on. I don't even like Facebook much, but it's where I can create consistently, distribute from, and repurpose easily. Consistency is the number one pillar.  If you're a writer, Facebook and LinkedIn work well. If you're great on video, use a video-centric platform. I can't consistently produce video, so I don't try. I do what I can consistently do.  If you know what you can create consistently, focus on that. They all work. Be consistent in creation and distribution.


## Building an Audience: Four Content Buckets

**Summary:** James Kemp introduces four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problems, and plan – that drive audience engagement and build trust. He explains that the best content incorporates one or more of these elements.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** What do you say? 90% of results are driven by 10% of your content. I've posted thousands of times, and can highlight two dozen posts that moved the needle. There are four content buckets: *philosophy*, *proof*, *problems*, and *plan*.  Philosophy is what you believe. It used to be nice-to-have, now it's essential. What we do is commoditized, but *we* aren't. People buy who you are and what you believe. What do you believe? How do you think differently? What's hiding in plain sight?  Delivering insight signals you as useful. You provide an external perspective. I talk about congruence. Fat personal trainers don't get many clients. That's a philosophical take. I do what I teach, and teach what I do.


## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Philosophy and Proof

**Summary:** James Kemp elaborates on the philosophy and proof content buckets. Philosophy involves sharing your beliefs and unique perspectives, while proof goes beyond testimonials to demonstrate how you help clients achieve results.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** People would be shocked how little profit some "7-figure heroes" make.  I share my struggles.  This demonstrates you're human.  *Proof* is nuanced. It goes beyond testimonials. Prove you can help by demonstrating *how* you help. This delivers insight on how someone got a result. Don't just say "so-and-so got a result." Demonstrate the steps and insights. "These are the three ways someone got this result." This proves you can replicate it. These make excellent ads.  *Problems* demonstrate competence. Share insights you gather. The more common the problem, the more unique your solution, the more traction you get. Give it all away. Don't hold back. Observe and offer solutions. This works on two fronts: people want you to solve their problem, and you build goodwill by helping. I have numerous examples of people reaching out after these posts saying they changed something and got a result.


## Building an Audience: Content Buckets - Problems and Plan

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the problems and plan content buckets.  Problems involve addressing common audience challenges and offering solutions, while plan demonstrates leadership by outlining a clear direction and vision.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:**  I love seeing people do this. Delivering certainty in uncertain times is crucial. The *plan* is the big daddy of content. It demonstrates leadership.  To establish leadership, decide on a direction, define it, and lead others. The plan brings together all other content types. It's a demonstration of certainty. Plans require courage. They work as pillar content. I talked about my path back to $3 million a year. 10 months later, I hit it.  It's a demonstration of competence and certainty.  Having a plan is essential. "I'm going to do this with this many people." These are effective ways to grow an audience and be relevant. They require courage because you're exposing yourself.  My client set a high profit goal. He's not hitting it, so he's writing about why and what he's doing differently.  These have a soap opera element. People follow along. Taki had a plan to help 50 coaches to a million a year. It was a narrative he wove through his content.  Plans can also take the form of sharing results. "7 things I learned to create a $73k MRR business." Share the insights.


## Building an Audience: Calls to Action and Content Reps

**Summary:** James Kemp challenges the conventional wisdom of always including a call to action, suggesting that high-quality content often speaks for itself. He recommends starting with three content pieces per week and increasing frequency as you become more prolific.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:**  Do you have to have a call to action? I have higher performance on posts *without* a CTA. Social media that constantly tells people to do stuff ceases to be social. If the content is good, you'll get a response. You don't need a CTA on every post.  If something is time-based, a deadline, or limited spots, it's natural to point it out.  What reps are required? Consistency. I write daily, so people think I'll make them do the same.  If you can't do it consistently, don't do it. Start with three times a week and increase frequency when you become more prolific. Content reps build content reps.  The way to write more is to write more.  Establishing the skill makes it easier to deploy.  There shouldn't be force in content creation. If you feel forced, narrow it down to be creative and consistent. Your results will vary. Establish a benchmark.


## Buying an Audience: The Daily Client Machine

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses buying an audience through paid traffic, highlighting the potential pitfalls of generating low-intent leads. He introduces the Daily Client Machine as a solution for building an audience and converting leads into paying customers.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** The third pillar is *buying*. All leads aren't created equal. You can build huge lists of unresponsive people. Paid traffic is powerful but dangerous. It can generate large volumes of low-intent leads. You build an audience, but not fans. The Daily Client Machine solves this. It builds an audience *and* partitions leads into customers.  There are two components: the big idea and the customer offer.  Run a simple funnel: ad to landing page to sales page.  My ad: "Say goodbye to sales calls."  My landing page: "Get the exact GDoc template that sold $802,000 of consulting without a sales call."  80% of landing page results come from the headline. This converts at over 40%, leads are $2.50, and customer purchases pay for the ads.


## Buying an Audience: Leveraging the Daily Client Machine

**Summary:** James Kemp explains how the Daily Client Machine can be used for organic growth and shares examples of its implementation, emphasizing the importance of the welcome email in setting expectations.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:**  Get to the template, then the sales page with a customer offer. This is the most efficient way to grow an audience, leads, and convert to customers quickly. It solves the problem of thousands of leads and finding the few who will buy. Turn them into customers early. The Daily Client Machine can also grow organically. Mine go in my social media bios.  I still get 20 sign-ups a day. Pay attention to the welcome email. It sets the scene and expectations, and how they can become a customer or client.  These are the three ways. An audience is a long-term investment. Short-term actions create long-term results. Think long-term, but manage expectations. Returns are nonlinear.


## A Comprehensive Audience-Building Plan

**Summary:** James Kemp provides a practical plan for building both a large and high-quality audience, combining elements of borrowing, building, and buying. He emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective and managing expectations.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** People want instant clients from social media and ads. That's not how it works. Borrowing an audience is fastest for trust transfer, but lowest volume. A good plan: *Borrow*: Turn up twice a month to teach. *Build*: Post three times a week on primary and secondary platforms. *Buy*: Run the Daily Client Machine with a $50/day budget, two-step lead magnet, and $100 customer offer. This builds a large, high-quality audience, filters for ready buyers, creates trust transfer, and generates volume.  The mixture is up to you.


## Reaching Out to Borrow an Audience

**Summary:** James Kemp provides advice on how to approach someone to borrow their audience, suggesting a simple and effective script focused on offering value and demonstrating what's working now.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:**  Everyone got the doc? Is there a script? No. "I've got something cool. I'm doing this. Would it be useful if I shared it with your people?"  The "what's working now" frame is easy to sell. It's easy to sell to the audience owner and gain insight.  You don't need a grand strategy. Showing what's working now is easy to sell, deliver, talk about, and convert. How do you find people with your audience? You need to be in the in-group.  Be in communities like this.  When you've established yourself, you can answer people's questions. It's a natural stepping-off point. Most people don't contribute enough value to their communities.  If you don't have people you can ask, you haven't been useful enough. The value of a community is in the value you bring.  You can extract value after you've delivered it.


## The Value of Contribution in Communities

**Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of contributing value to communities before expecting anything in return.  He shares his own experience of becoming the most useful member and reaping the rewards.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** Most people's mindset in communities is "what do I get?" They close off opportunities.  You have to demonstrate before you ask.  People are asking, "What's in it for me?" Few give freely, so few get freely.  I decided to be the most useful member of any group I joined. The more useful I became, the more I got in return.  People think about what they get, not what they give.  Those who give the most get the most.  How do you identify true fans from a list? By making offers. I'll cover that more next week.  Making offers attracts and repels. It's list hygiene.  Those who aren't open will leave. They were observers, not fans.


## Refining Offers and Leveraging Paid Advertising

**Summary:** James Kemp advises on testing offers organically before running paid ads, especially for new customer offers. He also emphasizes focusing on one offer and getting it right rather than creating too many different offers.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** Should you test offers organically before paid ads? Yes, especially for new customer offers.  If it's established, go straight to paid traffic with a lead magnet.  Look for something people will engage with and buy, warm or cold.  Focus on one offer and get it right, rather than creating too many.  My content is coaching content. I coach through my content. I relay recent coaching sessions. It's raw and energetic. Is there a process?  The key is recency. The most engaged posts followed a moment of insight.  Don't hold back.  Give it all away. Deliver the same ideas to your audience as to clients, just less personalized.


## Following Up After a Successful Presentation

**Summary:** James Kemp suggests running a group call with a call to action for following up with a large number of leads generated from a stage presentation, rather than offering individual calls.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** I jumped on stage last week. I gave it all away.  I got about 300 contacts. I wanted to give more.  Any recommendations for follow-up? If you have 300, I wouldn't offer individual calls. What was their hook? Doubling profits? Run a virtual session with a call to action. "I spoke to you at the conference. Many are interested in doubling profits. I'm running a call next Wednesday to go deeper and offer a limited opportunity."  If you offer 300 calls, you'll get 100. You need another filter. Make a straight offer, then offer calls later.  A group call is more leverage.


## Creating a Public Plan and Sharing Personal Goals

**Summary:** James Kemp encourages sharing a public plan with a specific number of people you aim to help, emphasizing the importance of authenticity and meaning. He also advises against using fear of failure as a barrier to sharing personal goals.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** I like the idea of a public plan.  My primary focus is Instagram.  Should I create a plan to help X number of women beat menopause weight by the first of the year?  I'm going to stop you on the language.  It's not "training." It's "going to happen."  This frees you to do something meaningful.  If it's meaningful to you, people gravitate to it.  Don't tell them you're only 29.  I'm going to compete again next year. Is it ego-driven to share that? What if I fail?  It's relevant because it has meaning to you. We're seeking meaning.  Can you bottle that? That's the most profound statement.  How many people do you want to help? 50. Why is that not available? Fear. What if I fail? Then you have another story.  Practice what you preach. Be brave.


## The Power of Public Proclamations and Embracing Failure

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the power of making public proclamations, using the example of a client who publicly stated a profit goal.  He emphasizes that there is no actual failure, only directional progress, and that sharing your journey inspires others.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:**  He stated he'd be making $125,000 a month profit by December. When he met me, he had an $8,000 profit month.  He might miss it. Last month he only made $86,000.  But directionally, he's 10x'd his profits.  In the process, he's inspired others to state what they want publicly. This makes them move towards it.  Think in flywheels.  How can we transfer meaning and vision?  What we think is impossible becomes available because we make it available.  I talked about making $3 million. I couldn't have done it without you.  But we make these things private. "What if I fail?" There is no actual failure.  Helping one person isn't failure.  There's no actual failure. You can't fail. It's an optical illusion. We all need reminding. I do all the time. I need to say these things to remind myself.


## Vulnerability and Conviction in Content and Sales

**Summary:** James Kemp encourages vulnerability in content, suggesting that exposing more of yourself creates a force multiplier for engagement. He also highlights the power of conviction in sales, using the example of closing a high-ticket client.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** I read so much content where I'm like, "Give me a little bit more insight, a little bit more vulnerability."  It's the force multiplier.  I closed a $2,500/month client in a parking lot. Why? I had so much conviction. I didn't care if they said yes or no. I knew how to solve their problem so well that they would be the failure if they didn't sign up.  There's a post in there.  I don't post on social anymore, I do Google Ads. I wanted to share something that's working. I've been hitting grand slams lately. I got pissed off and wrote a ridiculous landing page. It's just text. I go off on knowing their problem. "This is what you're thinking, next you do this." It's conversational. I have testimonials at the bottom.  People say, "You said it better than I could." That gets me leads. I convert them to a conversation via text. My initial offer is to show them I understand their problem so well that they can't imagine I don't know how to solve it.


## Closing the Gap Between Insight and Action

**Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of closing the gap between insight and action, suggesting that demonstrating real-time problem-solving resonates with audiences and attracts clients.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** If you're working with clients, close the gap between solving the problem and sharing the insight.  If you're demonstrating you're in the trenches, people who want to solve those problems will come to you. The faster you close that loop of solving and sharing, the faster you get resonance and clients.  I'm great at selling high-ticket one-on-one services, but I have a mega issue selling mid-ticket. I have high-ticket and low-ticket, nothing in between.  When we sell one-on-one, we make a promise to find and solve a problem.  When we sell to groups, we prepackage the problem into a promise: "We will solve this problem."  When we sell one-on-one, we talk about specific outcomes.  When we sell group, we aggregate the outcome: "You will see this."  The problem is prepackaged.  The more specific, the more they can engage.


## Selling Relief and Prioritizing Tension Removal

**Summary:** James Kemp explains that coaching is primarily about selling relief from a problem that causes tension.  He advises front-loading offers with a quick diagnosis call to provide immediate relief and build trust.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** When people say, "I want access to you," what are you saying?  You're probably stretching the gap to providing relief.  Coaching is selling short-term relief.  We package a call to solve the problem immediately.  The more immediate the relief, the better. "We'll get on a 15-minute call, then you can check in weekly." This closes the gap between future relief and relief 24 hours from now.  Coaching is selling relief from a problem that causes tension. We prioritize things that remove tension or stress.  We can't live in a high state of stress.  Coaching is providing relief quickly, then extending that: "Once we've solved that problem, we'll solve the next one." The promise is short-term, the vision is long-term.


## Being True to Your Fans and Embracing Discernment

**Summary:** James Kemp advises against being wishy-washy and trying to please everyone, emphasizing the importance of a tight plan that allows people to easily say yes or no. He also discusses the concept of true fans and their unwavering loyalty.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** Where I've been straying is not being true to the true fans.  The tighter your plan, the easier it is for people to say yes or no. Most people build their business to please everyone.  They're constantly thinking, "What does the market want?" Most people don't know what they want.  We are articulating ideals and demonstrating.  It's the handholds.  "This is interesting, or this is relevant."  The reticular activating system, the yellow car thing.  Sack yourself. Create raving fans.  The true fans are the true fans. Like a footy team, you don't change teams.  Offers and content are invitations to pay attention. The best offers are binary. Easy yes or no.  The best content is binary.  Popular people have detractors because they're individualistic.  You can't scale things you don't care about.  The coaching industry talks about scaling volume, not scaling care.


## Distributing Your Plan and Building Trust Through Content

**Summary:** James Kemp recommends sharing your plan across all platforms, regardless of whether it's a personal or business profile. He also discusses building trust and relationships through content, emphasizing total attention time and the number of insights consumed.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:**  Should I share my plan from a personal Facebook profile or a business page?  As long as you're in it, it doesn't matter. Put your plan everywhere. People can refer back to it.  Is there a best content format for building trust?  It's hitting the four points and letting them consume.  Total attention time. People binge my content before calls. They need to consume a certain amount to get enough insight.  A 20-minute YouTube video might have 7,000 words, which is about 30 emails. Both convert, but total consumption time varies.  With video, you move people faster because they consume at a higher rate.  We're chasing a certain number of insights.  10 insights could come from 10 Facebook posts or one YouTube video.


## Identifying Barriers to Buying and Removing Them Through Content

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the importance of identifying barriers to buying and using content to remove those barriers. He emphasizes the value of offer creation and how it can accelerate client acquisition and retention.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** When people buy, what conditions have they met?  There are natural barriers to buying. I focus on offer creation.  If I help people create an offer before they become clients, I can quickly tweak it to increase their earnings.  They've already done the groundwork.  They think I'm a genius, but they did the work. I know what moves the needle.  Getting an offer beforehand makes them more likely to become and stay a client.  We've already created momentum.  What do they need to get results? What do you need to give them so they see they can get the result, but are better off with you?  If your content proves they're looking at a barrier the wrong way, that's insight. If it shows they have what they need but don't know how to use it, that's insight.  Insight removes barriers.


## Simplifying Offers and Embracing a Scarcity Mindset

**Summary:** James Kemp advocates for small, easy-to-digest offers with fewer barriers. He criticizes the scarcity mindset of withholding help and suggests aiming to help people, which naturally leads to client acquisition.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** I talk about small promises. Easy-to-digest offers work.  Big, convoluted offers are hard to digest. "I need to be a marketing expert, handsome, and a millionaire to become a millionaire."  It's the "I need to lose weight before I join the gym" paradox.  If your content removes barriers, client acquisition and value delivery transform.  People have a scarcity mindset about helping before they become clients.  Aim to help people. They'll cross the thresholds.  You can solve a problem for $10 or $100,000. It's about levels of access.  I'm running a 5-day challenge. Should I change my messaging to call out the problem?  There are a lot of people selling results, not what they're doing.  I see high resonance with "I'll coach you," not "I'll get you this."  "Do you want accountability? I'll coach you personally daily. Want details?"  We've gotten away from selling what we're doing.


## Selling Coaching and Personal Accountability

**Summary:** James Kemp suggests reframing challenge offers to emphasize personal coaching and group accountability, providing specific examples of how to craft compelling messaging.

## The Power of Repulsion and Conditional Pricing

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the power of repelling unqualified leads and focusing on those who are a good fit. He also touches on the concept of conditional pricing based on client resources.

**Video Source:** 1000 true fans.txt

**Content:** You can do that with price. If they're millionaires, you'll find that out quickly.  "It's not just about money, it's about attitude." That makes it harder to access you.  I know two coaches with conditional pricing. "Because you have more money, I charge you more." I've never heard, "Because you're an asshole, I charge you more."  We try to hide behind layers of stuff. Focus on getting a yes or no. Both are valuable.  Maybes create false opportunity.  Yes or no are the only answers we tolerate.  If they can't say no, we close the doors.  Two people joined the Syndicate. Someone said they'd join, but weren't ready.  "You'll miss this intake." "Can you hold my spot?" No.  I'll open again.  People aren't used to this. They stay in the maybe.  Until it's done, it's not done.

## Defining the Sovereign Consultant

**Summary:** This chunk defines the concept of a sovereign consultant, emphasizing intentionality in building a mechanism, identity, and operating world to achieve high leverage returns from a small, engaged audience.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** The goal is building a million-dollar-per-year solo consultancy with 65 clients or less, working less than two days per week. This is achieved by intentionally building your mechanism, the identity people inhabit when they work with you, and the world you operate in.  It's not about massive email lists or social media followers; it's about telling a compelling story to a small group.  Intentionality is key to achieving high leverage returns from small audiences. You don't need huge lists, attention, or experience if you're intentional about these three categories.

## Client Acquisition Phases and Demonstrating Competence

**Summary:** This chunk outlines the phases of client acquisition (lead, customer, client) and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating competence at each stage to efficiently gain clients and minimize sales pressure.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** This model is alpha-driven.  A lead is someone you have the right to communicate with, a customer has transacted with you, and a client receives your dedicated time and resources. To obtain a client efficiently, demonstrate competence at each stage. While people can skip steps, a methodical sequence produces the best clients with the least sales pressure.  Understanding intent and desire is crucial, and initiating a transaction is the fastest way to gauge intention.  An offer-driven model provides a clear next step for prospects.

## The Client World Structure: Community and Consulting Levels

**Summary:** This chunk details the tiered structure of the client world, including community and consulting levels, and explains how a seven-figure run rate can be achieved with just these two tiers.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** The client world consists of a community level, a consulting level, and optionally, a mentorship level.  The mentorship level isn't necessary for a seven-figure run rate. The community level provides a broad base, while the consulting level offers more intimate, high-access service.  A menu of offerings allows for varied sales and delivery.  For example, a sovereign community might cost $100 monthly with a $3,000 annual option, alongside other higher-priced group programs and consulting hours at a premium rate.

## Core Reasons People Buy Help and Focusing on One

**Summary:**  This chunk identifies the four core reasons people buy help (make more money, save money, stay legal, live a better life) and stresses the importance of focusing on just one core reason for business clarity and effective messaging.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** There are four core reasons people buy help: make more money, save money, stay legal, and live a better life.  Focus on solving for only one core reason; all other benefits are secondary.  Focusing on a single core helps refine messaging, offers, and target audience, leading to greater clarity and effectiveness. While secondary benefits can attract and retain clients, a clear core problem is essential. Losing sight of this core can lead to confused messaging and a diluted brand identity.

## Understanding the Client's Problem and Solution

**Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of understanding how the core problem manifests in clients' lives, their awareness of it, and their current solutions to effectively tailor your unique solution and messaging.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:**  Understanding your core offering is crucial.  Ask yourself: What problem are you solving? How does it show up in people's lives? Are they aware it exists? How are they currently trying to solve it?  Connecting clients' pain to your solution is your job.  Understanding their current solutions allows you to position your unique approach within a ready market. Confusion around your core offering will negatively impact your offer creation and marketing.

## Staying True to Your Core Message While Being Multidimensional

**Summary:** This chunk acknowledges the multidimensional nature of individuals but emphasizes the importance of sticking to the core message when communicating with clients to ensure clarity and effectiveness.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** You are multidimensional, but your business messaging should remain focused on your core offering.  While clients can see your other facets, sticking to the core makes your message cut through the noise.  Secondary benefits can enhance your offering, but the core problem you solve should be the central focus of your communication.

## The Two-Tier Client Offer Structure and Pricing

**Summary:** This chunk prescribes a two-tier client offer structure (community and consulting/coaching) with specific pricing and client numbers to achieve an $83,000 monthly run rate.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:**  A two-tier client offer structure can generate a million-dollar run rate.  Tier two consists of 15 clients paying $600 per week, while tier one includes 50 clients paying $150 per week.  This structure, combined with a $100-$150 entry-level customer offer, can generate over $83,000 in monthly recurring revenue, requiring only 1.25 new client sign-ups per week.  Only 4% of customer offer buyers need to convert to clients to hit these numbers.

## Pricing Strategy: Maximizing Conversions and Economics

**Summary:** This chunk discusses the tension between maximizing conversions and economics in pricing, recommending specific price points for community and consulting offers to optimize both.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:**  Pricing should maximize both conversions and economics, which are often at odds.  A recommended strategy is a $100-$200 weekly community offer with a $3,000 annual option, and consulting offers between $300 and $600.  This pricing structure works across various markets.  The $3,000 annual option provides higher upfront value and commitment, capturing more value than shorter-term, lower-priced options.

## The Hybrid Offer: Combining Community and Consulting

**Summary:** This chunk introduces the concept of a hybrid offer, combining multiple products (community and consulting) into a single offer with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** A hybrid offer combines multiple products within a single offer.  For example, a $100 weekly community and a $450 weekly consulting product can be combined into one hybrid offer.  This offer includes clear promises, outcomes, and timelines, unlike individual products, which primarily serve as containers for your services.  This model allows clients to choose their level of access and speed of results.

## Selling the Hybrid Offer and Ongoing Commitment

**Summary:** This chunk explains how the hybrid offer facilitates client acquisition by offering an ongoing commitment and allowing clients to choose their desired level of access and speed of results.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** The hybrid offer sells an ongoing commitment, not fixed durations.  Clients can choose higher levels of access (consulting or mentorship) while receiving everything in the base community tier.  The key is a product that offers higher client value beyond the community level.  This allows clients to control their access and the speed of their results, with greater access generally leading to faster results.

## The Nuance of Selling the Hybrid Offer and Maximizing Value

**Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of a clear plan within the offer, outlining the promise, plan, pricing, and ROI to maximize value and resonate with prospects.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:**  A compelling offer needs a clear promise, plan, and price.  Can you articulate their desires and the outcomes of their commitment?  Can you describe what they'll see?  What negative downsides are you helping them avoid?  What happens first, next, and after that?  A clear picture of the next few days and weeks is crucial.  Pricing should offer a clear ROI and be easy to get started with.

## Crafting Compelling Offers: Promise, Plan, and Pricing

**Summary:** This chunk provides a framework for crafting compelling offers, emphasizing a clear promise, a detailed plan, and a justifiable price with a clear ROI, using a real-world example.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** Effective offers have a clear promise, plan, and price.  A strong promise outlines the specific outcome, like installing a lead generation system that attracts five prospects and secures one high-value client monthly.  The plan details the steps involved, like developing a client roadmap and setting up a content system.  This clarity allows for selling longer-term commitments (12 months) by focusing on initial, shorter-term commitments (6 weeks).

## Using Google Docs for Offer Creation and Iteration

**Summary:** This chunk advocates for using Google Docs for offer creation due to its speed, ease of sharing, and modification, allowing for dynamic iteration based on market feedback.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** Use Google Docs for offer creation.  They're fast to create, share, and modify, allowing for dynamic iteration based on market feedback.

## Clarity on Your Core Offering and Avoiding Messaging Confusion

**Summary:** This chunk reiterates the importance of clarity on your core offering and avoiding muddled messaging, especially as your business grows and evolves.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** Clarity about your core offering is paramount.  It's easy to get sidetracked, but staying true to your core offering is essential for effective messaging and offer creation.  Avoid muddying your message by trying to be everything to everyone.  Focus on what you do best and let that clarity guide your decisions.

## Product Structure: Content, Community, and Customization

**Summary:** This chunk outlines the three key components of product structure: content, community, and customization, and emphasizes the importance of a clear promise, plan, and price with a demonstrable ROI.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:**  Products should include content (training videos), community (interaction platform), and customization (tailored access).  Ensure your offer includes a promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI.  If you can deliver on these elements, your offer is market-ready.  Different levels of access within the product cater to varying client needs and budgets.

## Validating Your Offer and the Importance of Three Sales

**Summary:** This chunk sets a validation milestone of three sales for new offers and explains how even a small network can provide valuable feedback for rapid iteration and improvement.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** Aim for three sales to validate your offer.  This milestone allows you to test your offer's viability and gather initial feedback.  A smaller network allows for faster feedback and iteration, improving your offer more quickly through direct, real-world interaction.  If 30% of people who see your offer buy it, you have something scalable.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** Alternate between opening community access one week and selling workshop tickets the next.  This provides a long runway before needing structured lead generation.

## The Universe Rewards Energy Stewards

**Summary:**  The universe rewards those who effectively manage and amplify energy. By believing in the universe's support and acting as a conduit for energy, individuals can attract abundance in various forms.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Everything in the universe is energy. This central belief has helped me more than any other, because I believe the universe has my back. It will give me more than I can imagine if I create and distribute energy in all forms. It's a simple belief: if I create and distribute energy, the universe will reward me with more energy in different forms. I am content because I make others feel content. I am rich because I make others rich. I am safe because I make others feel safe. I receive generously because I give generously. I'm an energetic being, and if I give and create energy to other energetic beings, then I will receive back energy in different forms. Why would the universe choose to give me anything other than abundance if I'm the perfect steward and creator of energy? The universe is going to give me more energy to let it flow through me. I make a lot of money because I also give away a lot of money. I am highly creative because I give away a lot of that creativity and allow space for more, and I'm rewarded with more creativity because I allow these things to flow through me. I steward them, I create them, I amplify them, and the universe has given me more of them. If you feel this divine entity that we live in, the universe, has your back, then anxiety feels pointless, useless, short-term, petty. It feels dishonorable and unworthy of your place in the universe, of the energetic being that you are. Feeling it becomes an insult to the plan. Cultivating this mindset doesn't take long when you believe in the idea of a benevolent universe. Some of the emotions people hold so tightly just look inconsequential, almost pitiful to me when I think about where we all sit in the grand design.


## Overcoming Worry, Fatigue, Indecision, and Frustration

**Summary:** Worry, fatigue, indecision, and frustration are signals from your potential self urging you to change. By flipping these negative states into their positive counterparts – courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease – you align with your potential and the universe's flow.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:**  On a human plane, we dismiss worry, fatigue, indecision, and frustration as just part of life. But on a different timeline, they don't exist. If you are visited by these emotions, they are signals from your potential self to change. Your potential self, on the other timeline, is literally sending you signals, saying you are in a state you do not have to accept because I exist in this other state. When these negative states arrive, individually or together, step into the opposite state that exists on the potential timeline: courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease. This is the daily practice. When you feel any of those four, you can literally flip the script in the moment because that is already available to you on the other timeline. The flip is instantaneous because you already know, and it's already there. It's just the choice to flip it. The skill is the practice of flipping those when they arrive. You've already decided that the universe has your back, so it's dishonorable to sit in those negative places because the universe wants to reward you and rebalance. The universe is also dealing with all the other energetic beings who sit in those states all the time, and it says we need to rewrite the balance. We need to flip the script here. We need to rebalance by flipping this energetic being into one of these four states, or all of them at once. The universe wants to do that because it seeks balance. It is doing it a disservice to inhabit a negative state. You're blocking its gifts.


## The Power of Belief and the Illusion of Truth

**Summary:**  What you believe is more important than what is objectively true. By believing in a benevolent universe and your role as a creator and distributor of energy, you create your own truth and attract the corresponding results.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Plenty of other people are going to inhabit negative states, so the universe wants to flip the script; it wants to reach balance. You cannot be wrong or misaligned if you operate from positive states. The universe will balance it out for you. Even if you make a perceived objectively wrong decision, that wrong decision will be made right if you stay in a positive state. The wrong decision will be made wrong if you make a decision from a state of decisiveness and then flip back to indecision. People flip between the states they're in. They flip between indecision and decision. They make a decision, then they flip back to indecision. So the universe doesn't make the decision right because they flip back to the other state. If you maintain the state of decisiveness, the universe just balances it out and rewards it. If you flip back to the indecisive state, then the universe flips it back and makes the previous decisive state wrong because it gives you evidence that it was previously wrong. The art is staying in the state of courage, energy, decisiveness, and ease as much as you can, and the universe will come back and reward those states. Operating from those states is natural; it puts you at one with the universe, in the flow. Then the only tension is external.


## Controlling the Mind and Surrendering to Knowing

**Summary:** The mind needs to be right, so control it to define what "right" means for you. Surrender to your inner knowing, embrace the universe's support, and understand your potential exists on a different timeline, already realized.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** These concepts are great on a theoretical level, but they're difficult on a human level because of external sources and beliefs. If you don't believe that you already know, then you are right, and you'll block it. If you don't believe in a benevolent universe, then you are right, and it will give you that truth to prove you are right, that the universe doesn't have your back and wants to punish you.  If you believe the current state is the only state you can operate in, that there isn't another state to flip to, then you are right, too. This is the central paradox: the mind needs to be right. So we must control the mind and ultimately control the spirit to enable what right means for us. Surrendering to the knowing that you already have within you and embracing that the universe has your back, understanding that the potential you have lives on another timeline, already there – these beliefs ultimately become true. This has been true for me and for the people I've helped install these ideas in their lives because they sit in a level of flow, which means the day-to-day things that previously stressed them out no longer do.


## Removing Need and Embracing the Abundance Mindset

**Summary:**  By removing need and not relying on external sources for validation or sustenance, you become a magnet for others seeking to fulfill their needs through you. This abundance mindset fosters genuine giving without expectation of return.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Removing need works better for males than females. It means you don't need any external sources of energy or sustenance. You are your own being, and you don't need anything whatsoever. If you maintain that state, you will find that people will try and fulfill their needs through you. I get so many messages, emails, and long diatribes with people wanting stuff from me. I try to explain to them that it's because I don't really ask for anything and I don't profess any needs. I do not need anything from anybody ever. When needs pop up, I either deal with them myself or ask those close to me to help me fulfill those things. I got very good at asking, very good at receiving. Removing need helps, especially in an industry full of needy people. Many get into the expert industry to try and self-actualize, and they do it through the root of getting money, clients, prestige, and status. If you do it because you love the game, because it's fun, because you're giving energy back to the world, then you get much more of those things than anybody else, usually by many orders of magnitude.


## Stop Telling Stories and Embrace the Unknown

**Summary:**  Intelligent people often overthink and catastrophize potential outcomes. Instead of telling stories about the future, embrace the unknown and focus on controlling your inputs, not predicting the outputs.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Don't tell stories. This is the catastrophizing of all potential future outcomes that many intelligent people do. The more intelligent you are, the more stories you tell because your brain can abstract and posit second and third order consequences. Intelligent people tell the most stories because they believe they can possibly predict the maximum number of outcomes. "If I do this, then this will happen. If I do this, then this person will think…" It turns into a catastrophic whirlwind of ideas and pre-protected future outcomes that are all fiction. “If I do this, then this will happen, and if I do this, then I will lose this, and if I lose that, then I will be broke, and if I am broke my wife will stop loving me, and my kids will think I’m a loser, and then I will…” People can do that in a microsecond because they believe they understand the second and third order consequences of their decisions. My favorite story is, "I don't know," because it's the closest one to the truth that I know. If I do something today, what is the outcome? I don't know. My only story is, "I don't know, but I'm willing to find out." This means I surrender to a benevolent universe, and I'm constantly able to move forward because I surrender to the fact that I cannot predict the future, but I can give to it.


## Normalize Discomfort and Embrace Action

**Summary:** Normalize discomfort by repeatedly engaging in activities you perceive as challenging.  Think in questions rather than definitive statements, and default to speed by acting quickly on your decisions to build self-esteem.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Normalize discomfort. This requires embracing it, just like dissatisfaction. The story we tell about discomfort is usually much worse than the discomfort we experience by taking action. Normalizing discomfort is a superpower, enabling operation in spaces where others can't because they're not used to the stress. Normalizing discomfort is purely doing the things you currently see as hard or difficult repeatedly until they become… not easy, but just boring old reps. Similar to not telling stories is thinking in questions. I notice a lot of people think differently to me because they think in statements that are definitive and create the illusion that they know what is going to happen if they take a certain set of actions. I perpetually think in a state of curiosity: "I don't know what will happen if I do this. I believe this could happen. I wonder what will happen?" And then I take the action. I have trained myself to think in questions much more than in definitive statements because that helps me stay in the space of, "I don't know, but I can control the inputs. I just can't control the outputs." Default to speed. If you have cultivated removing need, not telling stories, embracing discomfort, and thinking in questions, the only thing left is to act. Action is the only way we move forward. The longer you take between coming to a decision and applying it, the lower your self-esteem becomes because you're sitting in the void of a lie. You have a knowing, a knowledge, and you're not applying the action. The bigger the gap between those things, the lower your belief that the gap will be closed. The slowest people to act always have the lower self-belief. The fastest people to act always have the higher self-belief because they get into the feedback loop much more quickly. They've surrendered to the fact that they don't know, but they acted, and then the action led to the next action, and then they stack those things together. When you have looked at your beliefs, assessed what you need to do, and then act immediately, your self-belief and self-esteem rise because you've closed the gap between what is true for you. If you don't close the gap, then you're operating in the void, which is, "I know these things, but I'm not acting on them," and then your belief in future action will diminish.


## Embracing Your Rightness and Choosing Empowering Beliefs

**Summary:** Everyone's beliefs are right for them. The key is to choose beliefs that empower you and align with a supportive universe, leading to a rewarding experience of rightness.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** The biggest challenge with mindset stuff is that you are always right. All the things you believe, by nature, are right. People spend their whole lives arguing about right and wrong, but your beliefs are ultimately right, and then you essentially act in validation of those all the time. Everybody's right. The art is choosing the set of beliefs that you operate under that enable the rightness to be rewarded. Without a belief that the universe has your back, it's pretty difficult to get my point.


## Anxiety, Momentum, and Trusting the Universe

**Summary:** Anxiety often arises when we slow down and overthink our current position instead of focusing on our direction.  Trusting the universe and maintaining momentum are key antidotes to anxiety.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** I really like this, and it… I turned up late today because it was the perfect timing for me, because I feel like I've been getting lately really quite anxious every now and then. It's really interesting, like looking at everything that you've said here versus when I seem to feel it. I seem to feel this anxiousness around business when I… you've said it to me before, when I slow down too much to the current space, and I… and I start to look too much at… this is good… it's hard to put it into words, but where I am now as opposed to where I'm going. Then I start to overthink everything, and I start to feel lost. Usually the antidote to that is, as you always say, it's getting back into momentum. It's weird, because sometimes… I guess this is the believing that the universe has your back. I guess that in that state of anxiousness, I start to think, "Shit, what if just getting back into momentum won't be enough this time? It's been enough these other times, but I'm like, 'Fuck, what if it's not going to be now?'" And then I start to overthink, and that slows me down from getting back into momentum. It's very strange, but this has been a great reminder, because I'm slightly in that state now of just… everything seems to work when I don't actually do a lot of the things I used to do, and I just focus on moving forwards and staying in momentum and focusing on where I'm going.


##  Overcoming Anxiety and Seeing the Board

**Summary:** Overcoming anxiety can initially feel unsettling, but it ultimately unlocks a greater capacity to see the path forward and make the right moves, trusting in the flow of the universe.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Up until three years ago, I lived in a pretty much perpetual state of anxiety, to a low level or to a high level. When I started to unpack some of this stuff and some of these ideas for myself and operate in that state of removing anxiety and really thinking about what it was, rather than a mental thing or a chemical thing, or whatever, some kind of pathology of it… the first experiences of not having anxiety made me anxious because I was anxious that I didn't have anxiety anymore. It perpetuated for a little bit longer because then I was like, "But this is a thing that everybody else has and everybody else does, and then I removed it." And then I started to wonder why I didn't have any of it anymore. But then when I was on that plane, I had this level of capacity and being able to see the board in front of me that I've never had. I knew the next move. In the last few years, a lot of people have asked me, "Who's your mentor? Who are you getting coached by?" Most of those things have been very specific or spasmodic because I am… because I can see the board in front of me. I know the next move, even if I don't know what it is. I know it's there, and I know it comes. The removal of anxiety is essentially that peeling back of… all the moves are there, and they… I can see all the concurrent timelines on how they go, and I just decide and choose, and I operate in that state. The transition from having consistent, constant anxiety… and again, we shouldn't judge any of these things, because there are our own personal semantic definitions of them. Some people have debilitating what they call anxiety, and other people just sit there with a low level of it and are not even aware of it, and it drives them. That kind of judgment of what it is is pointless, but the removal of it allows you to tap into the flow, which says all the moves are right there, and the surrender to them, and there is no wrongness in any of it. There is no worry. There is no central thing that is catastrophic that will go wrong.


## The Body as a Supercomputer and the Importance of Raw Materials

**Summary:** Our bodies function optimally when provided with the right inputs, including proper nutrition, sleep, and awareness. This allows our minds to operate at their best and align with our authentic selves.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:**  This resonates so much, and I would love to add a thought. My opinion is that, yes, to all that you said, and also the understanding that our body is a supercomputer and therefore it operates best when it's given the right raw material. So energy and, yes, active participants to be carrying for our mind and body. I hear you saying, though, and that might just be the story that I'm telling myself, so therefore it's true for me, because I hear you saying, you know, not operate from a need. But what I was going to say is things like the right food sources, the right amount of sleep, the right amount of awareness gives our body the raw material it needs to function at its best. So then our brain operates at its best. I love… I want to offer another analogy. Daniel Priestley gives the analogy of the David, and I had never heard that story before, but the way he says it in the 10x Is Greater Than 2x is that the creation of the David was the removal of everything that was not the David. I think when we look at us as humans, I feel like sometimes it is this journey of removing everything that is not authentically true to who we are, because, I agree, I think we innately know, when we give ourselves space to be present with it, who we are called to be. We go through a process of remembering and clarifying and seeing who that is and letting go of everything that isn't part of it.


##  The Light Touch of Holding Results and Avoiding Tight Grip

**Summary:**  Holding results too tightly, especially financial ones, can lead to their loss.  A light touch and trust in the universe's balancing act are crucial for achieving desired outcomes.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Someone said to someone the other day on a private call about their holding tightness of results, their results being money. Money particularly is like sand in your hand. The harder you squeeze it, the more it leaks between the fingers and disappears. A light touch and just holding these things is the balancing of the scales of the universe, just letting it happen. The actions that they were taking now will lead to the results that they can believe and imagine. They're holding it so tight that those things are just slipping through their fingers, and then they're essentially delaying it.


## Low Self-Esteem, Lies, and the Importance of Action

**Summary:** Low self-esteem stems from consistently lying to ourselves by knowing the truth but not acting on it. Closing the gap between knowledge and action is crucial for building self-belief.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Low self-esteem is a product of consistently lying to yourself. Lying is a product of knowing the truth but not acting on it. A lot of people know what they need to do, and when they don't do it, their self-esteem lowers because the gap is what lowers it. If you know, act, know, act all the time, you have very high self-esteem. If you know, delay, think about it, talk to people, seek consensus, change… you are mentally [expletive].


##  Avoiding Dogma and Embracing Individuality in Practices

**Summary:**  Prescriptive approaches to energy sources like diet and exercise should be avoided in favor of individualized practices.  What works for one person may not work for another, and even seemingly negative experiences can fuel creativity.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** I tend to stay away from prescriptions around energetic sources like diet or exercise because they're very personal. I predominantly stay away from dogma in those categories because there are lots of things that I've discovered that don't fit into a traditional view. For example, I've had some of the best ideas ever and acted on them when I've had the most horrendous hangovers that a human can ever have. I think hardcore sleep deprivation is one of the greatest creative fuels, used sparingly. But once in a while, that's available to anybody. You just can't do it all the time. The stimulus and the season matter a lot. That's why I don't buy into a lot of good/bad binaries around a lot of health and a lot of the pieces. They're all useful. Drugs, they've all got a place for the individual in the season or the stimulus, or they don't because, equally, many of those things that I say will work for me will actually harm somebody else.


## The Value of Ancient Wisdom and Personal Application

**Summary:** Explore ancient texts like religious scriptures and the Tao Te Ching for wisdom about flow and the universe's workings. Apply these teachings to your life and distill them for personal relevance.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** I believe it's really useful to read one of the major religious texts and actually have one. I've got a copy of all the major religious texts. I read the Bible pretty frequently. I think it's an amazing source of wisdom. I believe in God, not the God that's mentioned and not the God that Christianity identifies with. I believe in God, but I believe in *a* God. I believe in God, not *our* God. In terms of my understanding bridging to application, the Tao Te Ching was probably the most helpful in terms of talking about flow and talking about how the universe wants to operate and how it does. Anything that's old and has stood the test of time is worth applying. All of my discoveries are through consuming really old wisdom and then applying it and then distilling it. I'll come across stuff that actually matches my belief because someone's come to the same conclusion as me, like when I first read Reality Transurfing. I was like, "Oh, [expletive]. Vadim Zeland has done an amazing job of talking about what I believe, in his own way and his own designations." He talks about lucid dreaming and some other stuff that I'm not familiar with and haven't practiced. But I will read these things, and then I'm like, "Oh, this kind of validates my worldview," and I go, "Oh, well, okay, this applies to me." I actually then avoid it because I don't want… I don't need and want to be right on this stuff. I just need to know what the application is for me. So everything that I tap here is ancient.


## The Power of Stillness and Unfiltered Knowing

**Summary:**  Doing absolutely nothing and sitting in stillness for extended periods can lead to profound insights and a deeper connection with unfiltered knowledge that arises from within.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** The other recommendation, and I've done this twice, is doing absolutely nothing, like sitting in one spot for one to two hours a day for about two months. The best book you'll ever read. Literally nothing. No computer. Just sit there with a notepad. For me, after about 35 minutes, stuff starts coming where you cannot consciously identify where it comes from. This is where I talk about the knowing that just comes up into your consciousness unfiltered. It will either catch you… it will probably initiate a lot of emotion. It could be… I've heard of people, and I had a couple of experiences with it, where it was almost psychedelic, like almost visual to a level of seeing things. It's interesting. Something is coming up and through that we don't allow to come through because we have stacked so much stuff around us. Even the thought of sitting there for an hour in a chair with no interruptions seems mentally punishing. I've tried meditation and all those things for long periods of time, and none of them worked for me. But just honestly sitting there for an hour or one to two hours changed a lot.


##  The Daily Practice: Flipping Negative States

**Summary:**  Instead of rigid routines, focus on a daily practice of immediately flipping negative emotional states – worry, fatigue, indecision, frustration – into their positive counterparts.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** What has never worked for me is having a daily practice. I tried everything. What has never worked for me is having this, "I'm going to do this for 30 minutes," or "I'm going to do this for that," apart from sitting there and doing absolutely nothing, which was a practice in itself. The idea that I was going to journal for a certain amount of time and do this meditation for 20 minutes, those things never worked for me. It wasn't until my daily practice of isolating and identifying predominantly those four states and making the daily practice of turning them around immediately that that daily practice actually started to pay dividends and move forward. They're 24/7 of turning around any kind of worry or any indecisiveness and practicing the flip of all those as quickly as possible.


## From Fatigue to Energy: Fake It Till You Make It

**Summary:** Combat fatigue by "faking" energy and engaging in movement. This creates evidence of your inherent energy and disproves the belief that you lack it.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** What's my flip for fatigue to energy? Honestly, deciding… the thing that I will fake it till I make it is energy because I've found with the things that I find important, I always have enough energy for those things. If I go, "I'm tired," those things might be objectively true, but I've got the energy to do the things that I find important. So with fatigue, my true "fake it until you make it" thing is, "Get my body up, do the thing." I make energy through movement. If I'm low energy, I'll go sit on the bike for 20 minutes, and I'll make energy, which is actually just breaking the belief of the idea that I lack any. If I can sit on a bike for 20 minutes, I've just evidently proved that I was wrong. So whenever I have low energy, I will use energy, which then reaffirms the fact that I had some in the first place. I just create the evidence for myself.


## Closing Remarks and Resources

**Summary:** James Kemp concludes the session, reiterating the value of the discussed principles and offering access to a document and recording of the training.

**Video Source:** sovereign mindset.txt

**Content:** Hope that was useful. It's a ride. It's a privilege in this thing that we call life. Glad to have you all on the way. I've dropped the doc… I dropped the doc in the chat before there. I'll put the recording up later on. Catch you later.

## Creating a $100k Community: Product and Offer Strategy

**Summary:** This session focuses on creating a community-based offer that generates $100k in revenue.  James Kemp emphasizes the importance of clear promises, actionable plans, and strategic pricing tiers to maximize both client acquisition and revenue generation.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** Morning peeps. I need to take a stance on these otters and the rooms. You end up interacting with otters and AI pilots more than you do with humans. I've got a doc for you as usual. Bear with me on resolution. So, $100k community, today we're going to talk about product and offer. I want to direct us more towards doing in these things rather than, dare I say, mental masturbation. The philosophy is important, but that's consumed by the learning and the doing. Today is about product and offer, next week, validating it with the founding members frame. Week 3 is next steps. Even those with existing community offers could do with sharpening. Results are always relative. How fast you get results comes from what you already have, and what work you're about to do. Sales are a product of 3 factors: audience (60%), offer (30%), and copy (10%). The audience is a product of what you've done before. The offer is how clear, relevant, and timely it is. Clarity is what promises it makes, relevance is how relevant that promise is right now, and timing can leverage trends. Copy is just the words you use. A receptive audience and a clear offer will take you 90% of the way there quickly. Your offer is your offer, relational to your marketplace and audience. Why community? Four reasons: monetizing an audience (most of your audience hasn't bought from you), a home for your stuff (reduces decision fatigue), ascending clients (easy start point), and taking prospects off the market. Economics: our goal is $100k from a community. In the sovereign system, we have clients, customers, and leads. We get leads, turn them into customers, and turn customers into clients. Some people will pay 50 times more than others. Economics comes from paying in full for 12 months and clients signing into higher tiers. The path to $100k is unlikely to be 20 people at $100/week. It's likely to be a mix: some at $100/week, some paying $3k for 12 months upfront, and some at a higher tier ($300/week).  If you have a big audience, a straight community level can work. But to maximize revenue, a higher tier is essential. A community has 3 components: content, the community itself, and customization. The simplest model is tier one ($100/week) with a training portal, community platform, and customization (group calls). Tier 2 is for those who want to go faster, including done-for-you components. If you have an existing high-ticket program, insert the community below it. The community offer is 12 months.


## Defining Your Core Offer and Crafting Compelling Promises

**Summary:**  This chunk emphasizes the importance of focusing on a single core benefit in your offer. James explains how to articulate the promise and plan of your offer to resonate with your target audience and drive conversions.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** Four reasons people buy: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Everything outside the core reason is a benefit. I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. Your core piece stems from your own beliefs. While I say a lot of things, I solve for making money. Everything else is a benefit. As you get more experienced, you deliver more benefits. Which of these 4 things are you solving for? How does it show up? Are they even aware it exists? How are they trying to solve it now? Confusion about your core reason bleeds into your offer and marketing.  Product is what we do, offer is how we sell it. Traditional coaching sells one or more products at specific price points. The hybrid offer captures the largest portion of the market. Simplicity is having a single offer: ongoing commitment, clear promises, outcomes, timelines. The sovereign community offer is a community-level hybrid offer. Specificity: "I want your support in getting offers pumping out cash without me having to crank the handle myself. Our goal is building a $3k offer that you take to $3k per week like clockwork." The plan: "We will install the sovereign system, talk about the client offer, customer offers, and then install the daily client machine." The promise, the plan, and the phases. This offer lives and dies on this page. Everything else is logistics. Price is relevant to value.  $100/week. What's the risk? Weekly frame, come in, can leave. I choose no guarantees, promises, or refunds. Guarantees are a product of trust perception. The more track record you have, the less you need a guarantee.


## Maximizing Community Economics and the Hybrid Offer Approach

**Summary:**  James discusses strategies for maximizing community revenue, including offering annual payments with bonuses and utilizing the hybrid offer model to present multiple tiers without confusing potential clients.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** We use the $100/week as a hook. Getting payment upfront is preferable. The average $100/week person stays 15-18 weeks, worth $1500-$1800. If we get $3000 upfront, we get cash upfront and they're more committed. I have a $3900 annual offer with a one-on-one call. This converts at 30%. To maximize conversions, I'd offer it at $2500-$3000. Offering $2500 annually is over a 50% discount. We use pricing to incentivize and collect cash. The hybrid offer sells the first tier without harming conversion to the client offer. "You're receiving regular workshops and 24/7 access. Beyond that, have an option for my personal help.  Members can upgrade or I can build you a custom plan to take an offer from $3k to $3k/week to $3k/day." The language is unforceful. "Maybe don't select this unless you really want it. It's likely you get all the support you need. If you want higher-level access, this could be for you."  Community benefits: "As a member, you get access to every recording and training." This is a recent addition. People were asking for access to all trainings.


## Refining Your Community Offer: Specificity and Addressing Client Obstacles

**Summary:** This section is a Q&A with attendees, where James provides personalized advice on refining their community offers. He emphasizes specificity in promises, understanding client barriers, and focusing on the core value proposition.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** Who's got an existing community offer that could be sharpened?  Ramzi: I focus on systems and processes for e-commerce sellers who want to step out of the business. Is that niche enough?  It's not specific. What does that mean for them? Time, freedom, flexibility. Most people don't want those things; they terrify them.  Help e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week. I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week.  Best offers are binary. Maybes make people broke. The terror is real when making offers. Most people will say no. Best offers, the majority will say no to, but those who say yes are the most committed.  Richelle: I help business owners transition to an asset-driven business, using summits and bundles. I need help with specificity. One client got 440 subscribers in 30 days.  It's sexy to the right person.  Helping people get their first 500 or next 500.  Step one is 500 subscribers. Step two is a conversion event.  If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one $5k client every quarter.  Small promises are easy to keep.  Alphonso: I'm building a marketplace for my 500+ email deliverability clients. Offer: first 50 founding members get a podcast, webinar, and YouTube feature. How do I pitch this?  A community connects them. You're building a network.  What's in it for them?  The first sale is to yourself.  Ideas float around in your head until you write them down. The marketplace is the ultimate arbitrator. Most people will say no. I construct offers most people will say no to. I'm looking for something that polarizes.  Richelle: You mentioned two tiers. I offered my sovereign level first and got no sales. Is it bad if the first few people didn't purchase?  If you have data on why they said no, use that. If they ghosted, be more specific.  Steve: How do I include community with one-on-one conflict resolution?  The community is best positioned for clients you've worked with before, for ongoing support. Work the intensive, then offer the community.  Rebecca: I'm having trouble with offer commitment. Promise: avoid costly mistakes and transition to the tiny house lifestyle.  What happens?  We go through a roadmap, blueprint, design, finances, downsizing, action plan.  You're selling a specific mechanism of life. They need to be committed to that journey. What's their perceived barrier? Land, lending, price, downsizing.  What actions do they need to take? Sell their house, finance.  Bring those things into now. Remove the barriers.  Show them what they need to get for their house, a finance plan, and first plans. Offer a small paid product: "Pay a few hundred bucks, we'll plot your exact tiny house plan financially."  Guy: My offer is for project managers: 6-figure role, reduced stress. Is that enough to differentiate?  Most people would take a little bit more stress for more money. Focus on the 6-figure PM job. Reduced stress is the next problem to solve. Every solution creates another problem.  Ahmed: My community offer value drops after 4-5 months. Should I switch to a one-time payment and smaller weekly fee?  Pricing is a proxy for value. Why don't you deliver more value?  We have weekly trainings. I could teach more, but I'm running out of things to teach.  Most businesses have the fundamentals. Bad businesses look for the new piece. Repackage the fundamentals.  Give them old value in new ways.  Maximize value, maintain/increase price.  Khan: I'm launching a community offer in English: $50/week for calls and community, $150/week for implementation, $250/week for WhatsApp, $750/week for one-on-one. Too complicated?  Launch the middle two tiers in a hybrid: $100 and $250. The $100 is an easy start point, the $250 allows for higher-level access. More creates confusion. Treat free members as leads. This is the founding offer.  Stefan: I'm working on an offer for customer experience optimization. How do I get specific on the goal when outcomes are different?  You choose the playground. The sovereign community offer ($3k to $3k/week) isn't relevant for a $13M/year client.  Who's your first customer?  A medical supplies business with high turnover, low staff, no digital expert.  Currency can be time and energy. Installing one system saves 10 hours/week.  What do they want? Demand and money are unlimited.  What's the intersection?  Sell to the demand that's already there.  Adam: How many benefits can be added?  All of them, but lead with the core.  What if tier one is live a better life, tier two is making money?  Too confusing. Tier two is faster, more access.  How to get paid in full?  Both ways work. For large discounts, don't mention it in the doc. For bonuses, pre-sell it. The $100/week is a strong enough lead.  Put offer hypotheses in the community for feedback. Specificity is key. Train yourself to be specific, and it carries over to all communication.  Things people can point at are footholds on your content.


## Workshops as a Client Acquisition Strategy

**Summary:** This segment focuses on using workshops as a powerful tool for acquiring clients. James emphasizes creating workshops that deliver real value, focusing on client needs, and strategically making offers within the workshop context.

**Video Source:** 100Dollar Offers.txt

**Content:** So when I am starting to think about a workshop, I'm always looking at what clients want. The reason I'm holding a workshop about workshops is that the market is in a low-trust place, and workshops are effective for building trust.  The market has become cynical, and workshops are an antidote because they allow you to demonstrate value.  Once we've got a concept of what clients need, we turn it into an offer. I make the distinction between products and offers. Products are something we do, an offer is something people engage with. So I package it up in a way that is attractive. $100 is a nice price point.  Workshops are challenging if you're doing something brand new. They're not necessarily a place to test concepts, but they are a place to reframe, reiterate, reteach, and remind clients. We have fatigue, life gets in the way, people get off track. The best workshops reiterate, reteach, and remind, giving them a new frame.  You need people to do shit. The people who do stuff for you are sick to death of being fat. No more convincing will get them to that point apart from being utterly fed up. People buy stuff to make feelings go away. Show them what works in the workshop, give them the blueprint. Package it into a solution, like the 7-day fasting solution.  After 7 days, if they want to become a client, credit their workshop investment.  Focus on people who are ready. People don't wake up ready because of an email. They wake up sick of feeling a certain way.  Nurturing and educating doesn't move the needle.  I try and say the same thing 10 different ways. The workshop frame is self-contained. They give everyone a result. The worst mistake is holding a workshop just to get customers.  The more you try and manipulate, the worse it does. It's tempting to leave out pieces, but that's a huge mistake. You're under-delivering.  I sold over a thousand $100 tickets and over 500 at other price points last year. 100% refund guarantee, and we did 5.  A workshop is self-contained, has everything needed inside it. The approach is trust. The best clients understand the value of proximity and insight. They get the information and decide they want to be closer. Most people are fine with information. The majority will do nothing. Some will try. Some will see it work and come back. Some will think it's harder than it looked and need help.  If you measure workshops only on conversion rate, you are back to marketing, and most people suck at marketing. A workshop is self-contained, gives everyone a result, and trust happens after.  Are you ready? If you are, show up. I've got the safest way. Don't use the word "proven." The longer I go at this, the less prepared I am to convince. Here's an offer. Here's another. You stop where you want. People make themselves ready. Marketers have indoctrinated people to believe they can change minds, but that's mixing cause and effect. It's offers for people who are ready.  Take your marketing hat off, you're not there to sell. Focus on giving them the result.  One of the greatest gifts is a lack of anxiety. Aggressively marketing comes across as anxious. I come across like I don't give a fuck. You're gonna do you, I'm gonna do me.  The duality of good workshops is the more you create for clients, the more sales you make to customers best for clients. I want to work with people that understand the value of proximity. Results come from osmosis. Information is everywhere. The less sales I try to make, the more sales I make. I focus on client delivery.  Flipping the script: a workshop sells tickets, delivers to clients, and generates clients. Two frames: part of client delivery ("This is a workshop for our members") and a small part of something larger.  Show how it fits in the big picture.  The people I had to do the most salesmanship with were the worst clients. All the desire exists. Just make offers.  Don't spend time on a 42-step email sequence. They came to the conclusion themselves.  If you give them too much, they'll go somewhere simpler. If you mismatch the energy, they'll think you just want their money. Don't be a marketer.  Alexandra: I'm a marketer trying to get out of marketing. I run webinars for professional services businesses. I want to teach the framework and do a workshop. I struggle to come up with what a client wants. They just want done-for-you.  Done-for-you requires process and labor. Do-it-yourself is you do the process and labor. Done-with-you is I give you process and some labor, you bring some labor.  In this workshop, we'll create a 4-week webinar process campaign. I give you the templates, you fill them in.  Done-for-you is a tiny bit of time, DIY is all the time, done-with-you is a sliding scale.  Compress delivery to the shortest time possible (half-day workshop). Identify who will do the process. "Give me your intern for one day, give me $2000, and you'll have a webinar."  Identify the time, who will use it, and give them the process. They have to do some labor. Otherwise, they buy courses.  They don't buy group programs because they're not time efficient. They buy things one step away from done-for-you, but more economically viable.  Alex is good at setting up Zoom and pixels. The sovereign blueprint is built on principles: 2 days a week, dinner with kids, nothing scheduled Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.  Coaching is helping people discover the answer inside them. Consulting is giving someone the answer. Mentorship is showing someone how I would do it. A creator conjures original ideas, a curator assembles the best ideas.  If I do these things, this is how they come into fruition: share content, grow leads, create workshops, sell tickets, make it easy to get started, maximize client experience and LTV, build a client base, find those who value coaching.  Hierarchy: maximum 24 people in the circle at $750/week, maximum 100 in the syndicate at $250/week, no maximum for membership.  Many people intend to work with you. The key is making offers that get people to commit. Maybes kill progress. Offer-driven businesses don't get maybes. The strongest intent is purchasing.  Understand their intent. When someone buys a $9 ticket, did they do it to get what was in the workshop, to run workshops, or because they're fed up?  Most won't buy your coaching. The most efficient business has a range of offers. The sovereign blueprint: 2 days a week, $1M net/year, run on my own.  Because workshops are one component of the sovereign blueprint.  The judgment of a workshop is understood by looking at the marketplace. Most people won't buy. Most won't become clients. Most marketing filters through a thousand to find one unicorn client.  The realities of market dynamics: not everyone will buy your stuff. Leverage is identifying who is likely to buy, who will buy regularly, and who would find further access useful. Customers are one-off transactions, clients are allocated time, energy, and resources.  What people say and what people do are different.  The key to an efficient business is making offers that get people to commit. Maybes kill progress.  Offer-driven businesses don't get maybes. Purchasing demonstrates intent. Understand their intent.  Most of the market won't buy your coaching.  I operate within the power laws. Only so many will pay over $3k/month, and I can only coach so many effectively. I can mentor more, and information is infinitely scalable.  I work backwards from what clients need. I sell workshop tickets by defining what my circle needs.  I create for clients, give them proximity and access, insight and some access, and information. I turn creations into products, create customers, and invite them to become clients.  I've got a call as an option. Create workshops for clients, sell tickets to customers. Pricing isn't irrelevant, but relatively unimportant. Any purchase is a trust signal.  Purchasing has friction.  Four types of offers: money offers and live a better life offers. $100 workshops work for money offers, $25-$50 for live a better life offers. Pricing is a dial for volume.  The best thing about a workshop is it's a singular component. I produce a Google Doc and go live.  To dial up clients, add a bonus call.  Solve a single problem, deliver a single result. Sell them what they want, give them what they need. I trick my clients into coming by making it sound more fun.  I'm a big proponent of selling the next thing, making it sound great, but delivering what they need. Magic pills sell. Frame it magically while staying ethical.  If you're experienced, you can take more risks testing new ideas.  I believe people's time is precious. Repurposing something you're confident about and giving it a new frame is the best way to deliver. I've delivered workshops about workshops 3 times. I find new things, so I reteach.  Remember they're a small sum of the larger part. I can't help you build a sovereign business in this workshop. There's a bigger piece.  Three types of workshops: demonstration (show what's working, give them the things that work), model (show the overall model, give them a plan), and mechanism (help them use the mechanism to get a result).  Demonstration: show what's working, why it works, give them the things that work, and let them replicate. I want people to copy me.  Model: show the overall model, give them a plan, help them envisage theirs.  Mechanism: help them use the mechanism to get a result.  Traffic to your sales page is warm. You don't need long sales pages. Short, punchy, bullet-pointed pages work best.  The more you give to sell, the more objections.  Put logistical details on the sales page. Content pre-sells the sales page. 3-7 day promotion periods work well. Most people run out of things to say before 7 days.  Content builds context. By the time they get to the sales page, they're sold on the context.  Your workshop depends on your delivery method. Some do slides, workbooks, docs, straight to camera. I like docs because they help me think.  Delivery has two parts: the vehicle (document, slides) and the conversation (Q&A). Insight can happen during or after.  The replay goes into the community. If they don't join, they get it on an ungated page.  Ungated means it's pirated, but it works in your favor long-term.  How do you get clients? The key metric is the number of offers you make. Insert the offer briefly but carefully.  Client offers convert better when offered to customers. Workshops convert better than webinars.  It's easier to sell to someone who's bought before.  Five touch points: 24 hours and 60 minutes before, beginning, end, and replay.  If you offer a call, that's a fifth touch point. The more offers you make, the more clients you get.  Three common mistakes: building a workshop like a webinar, building a workshop to sell (leaving pieces out), and creating workshops when desperate for clients.  Even if you don't have clients, run a workshop for an imaginary client. Focus on delivery.  Results are created long-term.  Good results come from giving good insights, teaching, and experiences.  If you focus on delivery, then have a system to distribute it, you'll get the best results. Your marketing becomes demonstration and distribution.  Most people spend 80% of their time marketing, 20% delivering. I spend 80% creating for clients, 20% productizing and monetizing.  I work backwards from what clients need.  There's a paradox with workshops: some of the best for clients are the worst for customers.  Think about turning workshops into long-term assets the same way you think about ads.  Run 10 workshops to find the one that works long-term.  Judge them on three dimensions: product, delivery, and client generation.  What are you focusing on? Client acquisition? Run spicy workshops that give immediate results.  When upselling, send reminders 24 hours and 60 minutes before.  Deadlines are the most ethical scarcity. If you're doing things live, you have natural scarcity.  Scarcity is interesting. If you impose it, it's not real. If you constrain yourself, it works.  People choose round numbers like 10. What about 3? Set yourself up to win.  Winning is not losing. I put constraints on things that allow me to win by default.  If you're in the season of wanting to push people, you might want short, intense volume. But as soon as you try and create scarcity, you're back to manipulation.  Weekly workshops run out quick unless there's an anchor workshop repeated every second week.  If going weekly, repeat something 50% of the time. If you open all workshops to clients, respect their time.  With ads, you need instant gratification. Show-up rates plummet the further out you book.  Run the previous workshop as a product, then have the live workshop periodically.  Every quarter, I have a customers-only workshop.  Selling multiple workshops together? What are you trying to do? Increase client quality?  Churn reduction and retention is difficult to sell because it's invisible.  Craft products that show where they start and where they go.  How to double your $5k/month coaching business in 30 days.  Growth is getting more clients, keeping clients longer, getting clients to pay more.  Workshops are an antidote to expensive lead generation and long conversion cycles.  Frame the workshop as exactly what clients need.  Once you help people see power laws in their client base, they can double or triple their revenue from a single source.  Making a workshop tangible in the personal development space?  The root of every thought is a feeling. All feelings lead to thoughts lead to actions.  Make it physically present, point out where and when it happens.  People don't buy abstract things.  They want to wake up without dread.  Bring tangibility by making them physically present.  Everything has a place.  Tangibility of feelings has a place.  Future pacing is pointing at things that will happen in the future. The more immediate, the more tangible.  Personal development should focus on mechanisms. Get them out of their head.  Get them to do something tangible.  Even if it's brilliant, most won't do anything with it.  Be a little less depressed every day.  Change sells transformation.  Bring them down to something to point at right now.  How to generate content for email sequences?  I look at things and go, "That's interesting!"  I draw a vague line between the content and the offer.  Boston challenge workshop or web class? What's the distinction?  The web class shows them how, the workshop teaches.  What do you want? Clients.  $27 for the workshop, then invite them to become a client.  Don't run a web class. What would it do that the workshop doesn't?  This is marketing, more information.  Focus on people who are ready.  I've got the healthiest way for those who are ready.  Don't use the word "proven."  I'm less prepared to convince. Here's an offer.  People make themselves ready. Marketers think they can change minds, but it's offers for people who are ready.  Take your marketing hat off. Focus on the result.  Give them a lack of anxiety.  Aggressively marketing is anxious.  I come across like I don't give a fuck.  You're going to do you, I'm going to do me.  The more you create for clients, the more sales you make.  I want to understand the value of proximity.  Results come from osmosis.  The less sales I try to make, the more sales I make.  I focus on client delivery.  A workshop sells tickets, delivers, and generates clients.  Two frames: part of client delivery and a small part of something larger.  Show how it fits in the big picture.  The people I had to do the most salesmanship with were the worst clients.  Desire exists. Make offers.  Don't do a 42-step email sequence.  If you give too much, they'll go somewhere simpler.  If you mismatch energy, they'll think you want their money.  Don't be a marketer.

## Crafting a Compelling Offer

**Summary:** This chunk discusses the importance of a strong offer, working backward from the desired outcome, and the core components of an offer-driven model.

**Video Source:** 3k Code.txt

**Content:** Welcome! Today, we'll focus on constructing your daily client machine—how to generate leads hourly, customers daily, and clients weekly.  It's critical to attack things in the right order: offer, then sales, then marketing. The best way to hit a goal is to work backward from it.  Create and validate an offer, make three sales with a Google Doc, create a customer offer that converts 5% of buyers into clients, and then automate lead flow, customer offers, and ascend customers into clients weekly. This system creates leads and customers, engages with customers to understand their intent, and captures those who don't display immediate intent for future conversion. The two key components are your big idea and your customer offer. The process is: lead magnet (capture and opt-in), customer offer ($100 digital product), and client offer. The big idea is a product of your client and customer offers, a frame that catches attention, creates curiosity, and establishes authority.

## Big Ideas and Customer Offers

**Summary:** This chunk explores different frames for creating a big idea, including swiping, next steps, automation, and identity. It also discusses the customer offer and its role in converting leads.

**Video Source:** 3k Code.txt

**Content:** Many big ideas become so successful they become the brand.  Consider these frames: swiping (copy my success), next steps (your first client), automation (automatic clients), and identity (the sovereign consultant). Big ideas often have utility across multiple products (books, courses, consulting). My big idea, "selling from a Google Doc," led to a daily client machine that generates 5-10 leads daily and 1-2 product sales, doubling with simple ads. Put your big idea everywhere—social media profiles, ads.  The customer offer turns leads into customers. Ideal components include training, templates, a live workshop, and a call.

## Offer Creation and Validation

**Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer creation, validation through market feedback, and the key principles of promise, process, and plan.

**Video Source:** 3k per week.txt

**Content:** The path to a million-dollar business is simple, not easy: promise, process, mechanisms, plan, validation, sales, scale, automation. The hybrid offer is key, a single offer with multiple products.  Four reasons people buy help: make money, save money, stay legal, live a better life. Focus on one core reason; everything else is a benefit. Understand the problem/desire you're solving.  Validation is getting your offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales. Use the community for feedback based on real data.

## Hybrid Offer Structure and Pricing

**Summary:** This chunk explains the hybrid offer, its advantages over traditional consulting, and provides specific pricing recommendations for community offers, consulting offers, and customer offers.

**Video Source:** 3k per week.txt

**Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer, containing multiple products.  It includes a 12-month ongoing commitment with clear promises, outcomes, and timelines.  Pricing examples: Community offers ($100-200/week, $3,000 annual), consulting offers ($300-600/week), customer offers ($100).  This pricing maximizes conversions and economics, making it easy to get started and upgrade.

## Offer Construction Principles

**Summary:** This chunk details the three core principles of offer construction: promise, process, and plan. It stresses the importance of clarity, future pacing, and avoiding information overload.

**Video Source:** 3k per week.txt

**Content:** Three principles: promise (what gets done), process (how it works), plan (how it rolls out).  Promises should be specific and point to a clear future state.  Address what they won't have to do and what downsides you're helping them avoid.  The plan should clearly outline the steps and timeline, future pacing the prospect. Clarity beats cute; avoid overwhelming the prospect with too much information.  Focus on the result, not the volume of content.

## Offer Example and Modalities

**Summary:** This chunk provides a real-world offer example and discusses the different modalities of coaching, consulting, and mentorship.

**Video Source:** 3k per week.txt

**Content:** Example promise: "Support to install a system attracting 5 prospects monthly, securing 1 high-value client monthly, on your terms, without being the best-kept secret."  Example plan: "In the first 6 weeks, we'll install the client roadmap, product roadmap, and IP generator system."  Modalities: Coaching (discovering answers), consulting (giving answers), mentorship (showing how). I create for my community, coach on weekly calls, consult on WhatsApp, mentor on Zoom.  You can sell modalities individually or bundled into products.

## Access to Training and Classroom Content

**Summary:** This chunk addresses the value of accessing all trainings and recordings within a community membership.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:**  We've added a valuable benefit: access to all my trainings and templates.  Many people want a back catalog of resources. As a community member, you get access to every recording and training. This is a key benefit of joining.

## Offer Specificity and Niche Targeting

**Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of offer specificity, avoiding trying to be everything to everyone, and targeting a specific niche.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:**  Are you clear about your core offer? Have you defined your content, community, and customization? Have you scoped out your promise, plan, and price with a clear ROI?  The weakest offers try to be everything to everyone.  A clear promise is essential.  Have you laid out a plan with unique mechanisms? People buy new things that solve old problems.

## Outreach Templates and Offer Sharpening

**Summary:** This chunk discusses providing outreach templates and the importance of sharpening existing offers for better conversion.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** I'll be providing templates for outreach, including social posts and emails.  We'll cover these in detail next week.  For now, focus on your offer.  Are you working on a new offer or modifying an existing one?  Let's sharpen your offer for better results.

## Niche Selection and Offer Clarity

**Summary:** This chunk uses a real-world example to illustrate how to refine a niche and create a compelling offer promise.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** (Ramzi's example of e-commerce sellers wanting to step out of their business)  A niche defines the desire in the marketplace.  It's a good hypothesis, but not specific enough.  What will the outcome look like for them? Time freedom, flexibility.  Most people don't want those things because they're terrifying.  Pre-package a vision for them.  "Helping e-commerce business owners run their business in one day a week" is more specific.  "I'll help you install the 3 systems that allow you to run your e-commerce business in one day a week" is even better.

## Binary Offers and Commitment

**Summary:** This chunk explains the power of binary offers (yes/no) and how they attract the most committed clients.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** The best offers are binary (yes/no).  Maybes make people broke and frustrated.  The best offers get people to say yes or no, with a subset of "no" being "not now."  Most people will say no to the best offers, but those who say yes are the most committed.  Manufacture a binary that allows the right people to say yes.

## Structuring Offers for Choice and Specificity

**Summary:** This chunk discusses offering structure, the importance of providing a sense of choice while maintaining specificity, and addressing perceived barriers to entry.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** People want structure and choice.  "One day a week" implies they can work two days if they want.  Don't be afraid of specificity.  The best offers come down to a binary.  When creating an offer, you're making an offer most people will say no to.  The best offers are specific and polarizing, excluding the majority of the audience.

## Quantifying Offer Promises

**Summary:** This chunk uses another real-world example to demonstrate how to quantify offer promises for greater clarity and impact.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** (Richelle's example of helping business owners with asset-driven businesses)  Quantify your promises.  "440 subscribers in 30 days" is sexy to the right person.  Focus on helping people get their first 500 or next 500 email subscribers.  Are they sold on email as the mechanism?  Quantify the results of their conversion event (workshop, etc.).  "If someone joins your community, they get the tools to build a 500-person email list and run a sales event that gets them one client every time they run it" is a strong promise.

## Overcoming the Curse of Competence and Building Belief

**Summary:** This chunk addresses the curse of competence, how it hinders offer creation, and the shift towards building belief in the client's ability to achieve the promised result.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** The curse of competence prevents people from making specific offers.  Small promises are easy to keep.  Shift your messaging towards building belief in the client's ability to achieve the result.  Transmit belief in them.  Focus on "I can do it," not just "Look how great I am."

## Visualizing the Offer and Manufacturing Desire

**Summary:** This chunk emphasizes the importance of using vivid language to help prospects visualize the desired outcome and create a strong desire for the offer.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** Good copy helps prospects visualize the outcome.  Use concrete examples they can relate to (Stripe notifications, calendar appointments).  Allow them to abstract an experience they haven't had yet.  "Waking up to notifications" and "calendar with appointments booked" are more powerful than vague promises.  This is why people follow influencers—they want to imagine themselves living that life.

## Marketplace Offers and Founding Members

**Summary:** This chunk discusses creating a marketplace offer, attracting founding members, and the importance of validating the offer hypothesis.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** (Alphonso's example of building a marketplace for email deliverability clients)  A community is a low-friction network.  You're building a network of people selling to other people.  The first sale is to yourself.  Have an offer hypothesis people can buy into.  The ultimate arbitrator of an offer is the marketplace.

## Offer Polarization and Effortless Selling

**Summary:** This chunk explains how polarizing offers, designed to be rejected by most, attract the most committed clients and lead to effortless selling.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** Construct offers most people will say no to.  Look for polarization.  This excludes the majority but attracts the most committed.  There's no salesmanship, no pricing resistance, no convincing.

## Iterating on Offers Based on Market Feedback

**Summary:** This chunk discusses using market feedback (ghosting, objections) to iterate on offers and make them more compelling.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** (Richelle's question about offering multiple tiers and handling rejections)  If you have data on why people said no, use it to improve the offer.  "Too expensive" means they didn't see the value.  "No ROI" means you need to demonstrate the return.  If they ghosted, be more specific.

## Community Offers and Ongoing Support

**Summary:** This chunk explores the strategic use of community offers for ongoing support and recurring revenue, using a conflict resolution example.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** (Steve's example of conflict resolution services)  Position the community as ongoing support after an intensive engagement.  This drives recurring revenue and keeps clients in your world.  Don't call it a "community" at the offer level; call it an "ongoing support package."

## Overcoming Perceived Barriers in Offer Creation

**Summary:** This chunk addresses perceived barriers that prevent prospects from taking action and how to incorporate these into the offer to facilitate conversion.

**Video Source:** 100k community.txt

**Content:** (Rebecca's example of helping people transition to tiny houses)  Address the small inhibitors and blocks that prevent people from taking action.  Bring those things into the "now."  Remove the perceived barriers.  Example: "Step one is showing you what you need to get for your house to put it on sale, get a finance plan, and get your first plans in place."  Offer a small paid product to address these initial barriers.

## Offer Benefits and Core Focus

**Summary:** This chunk discusses the role of benefits in an offer, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a core focus while acknowledging the various benefits.

**Video Source:** 3k Code.txt

**Content:** (Adam's question about including multiple benefits) Include all relevant benefits, but lead with the core offer.  The driver of a desired outcome (e.g., better productivity) comes from a single source.  Define that single source.  Tier 2 is typically faster access, more intimacy, and more perceived care.

## Paid in Full Options and Offer Presentation

**Summary:** This chunk discusses the strategic use of paid-in-full options, when to mention them in the offer, and the importance of the core promise.

**Video Source:** 3k Code.txt

**Content:**  Mention the paid-in-full option in the offer document if you're bundling a bonus.  If you're offering a large discount against weeklies, mention it in the cart.  The $100/week promise is often strong enough; the core promise does the rest.

## Offer Specificity and Communication Impact

**Summary:** This chunk highlights the importance of offer specificity, its impact on overall communication, and the benefits of training oneself to be specific.

**Video Source:** 3k Code.txt

**Content:**  Focus on specificity in your offers.  Get the "pointing finger" out.  Can you imagine the promise?  Specificity in offers carries over into all communication, improving engagement.  It provides footholds for your audience.

## The Power of One: Building a $1M/Year Business with a Single Offer

**Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the simplicity of building a million-dollar online business using a single, well-crafted offer within the knowledge economy. He outlines the path, highlighting the importance of a tight, specific, and minimal offer-driven model.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:**  The path is simple, though not easy: make a promise, define a process with unique mechanisms, create a plan, present the offer, and validate it with sales. This model allows for dynamic, fast iteration using tools like Google Docs. Results happen in the marketplace, not from consuming ideas, so creating and testing offers is key. Validation means getting the offer in front of 10 people and making 3 sales.

## Fast and Stable Growth: Balancing Constraints and Flexibility

**Summary:**  James Kemp discusses the importance of stability for rapid growth, advocating for a balance between constraints and flexibility.  He emphasizes the need for underlying principles and frames to navigate uncertainty and ensure results happen *for* you, not *to* you.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** The most powerful systems are both fast and stable. To move fast, you need a mix of constraints and flexibility. While certainty is unattainable, having the right frameworks and principles allows you to capitalize on opportunities and solve underlying problems.  The initial setup involves defining who you are, what you do, and your target audience.

## Market Selection and Sociological Branding: Prioritizing Your Energy

**Summary:** Kemp explains the importance of market selection, advising to be close to money for greater financial success. He contrasts sociological branding (prioritizing your energy and desires) with psychological branding (catering to market demands).

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** Your market choice significantly impacts your financial results.  Being close to money—its creation, discovery, keeping, and transfer—increases earning potential. However, market selection should align with your desires, skills, and market permission. A sociological business prioritizes your energy and interests, attracting like-minded individuals through natural polarization.  This contrasts with psychological businesses that chase market demands, often becoming chameleons.

## Building Your Brand: Mechanism, Identity, and Transparency

**Summary:**  Kemp highlights the importance of a unique mechanism, a clear identity, targeted content, and transparency in building a compelling brand. He advises actively repelling those who aren't your ideal clients and focusing on total, honest communication.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:**  Key elements for a successful brand include a unique mechanism, a defined client identity, content showcasing your past, present, and future, and clear messaging that repels those you don't serve.  Transparency is crucial in a low-trust environment.  Total, honest communication trumps polished copywriting; authenticity attracts the right people.

## Client Value and Power Laws: Maximizing Revenue and Retention

**Summary:** Kemp introduces the concept of power laws in client relationships, emphasizing that not all clients are equal. He advocates for focusing on annualized client value and creating an ecosystem that allows clients to find their natural spending level.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** Power laws dictate that a small percentage of clients contribute a large percentage of income.  Ignoring this leads to diminishing returns and burnout.  Focus on annualized client value and create an ecosystem with revenue buckets.  This allows clients to naturally ascend to higher value tiers based on their needs and desires for access and speed.

## Cash Velocity and Revenue Volatility: Smoothing the Path to Growth

**Summary:** Kemp stresses the importance of lowering revenue volatility to reduce emotional stress and improve business performance. He recommends reverse engineering from your financial goals and incorporating one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** Recurring revenue businesses are robust, but recurring revenue doesn't always arrive as expected.  Lowering revenue volatility reduces emotional stress and improves operational efficiency. Reverse engineer from your financial goals and use one-time offers to boost cash flow while building recurring revenue. This allows for a sustainable pace and smoother growth.

## Offer Creation and Validation: The Hybrid Offer and Client Feedback

**Summary:** Kemp explains the hybrid offer model, which involves a single offer with multiple products at varying price points and durations. He emphasizes the importance of a clear promise, process, and plan, and using client feedback to refine the offer.

**Video Source:** source: 3k per week.txt

**Content:** The hybrid offer sells across a range of prices and times with a single offer.  Focus on a clear promise, process, and plan, allowing prospects to envision their future.  Prioritize clarity over complexity; many offers fail due to being indigestible.  Validate your offer by getting it in front of 10 people and aiming for 3 sales.  Use feedback, especially from those who say "no," to refine your offer.  In early stages, a "no" is valuable data.

## Leveraging Existing Assets and Networks for Offer Validation

**Summary:** Kemp encourages leveraging existing networks and assets for initial offer validation, emphasizing that an audience and a network are the same in the early stages. He advises testing the offer with a simple message and listening intently to prospect feedback.

**Video Source:** source: 3k per week.txt

**Content:**  For offer validation, leverage your existing network: past clients, email lists, social media connections, current leads, partners, and personal contacts. Test your offer with a simple message, focusing on the promise and making it easy to get started.  This is a listening exercise; gather data on how people respond.  "Ghosting" often indicates a lack of clarity in the offer.

## Refining Your Offer: Clarity, Brevity, and Context through Content

**Summary:**  Kemp advises focusing offers on the client's transformation, not your own story. He stresses the importance of brevity and clarity, using content to provide context and pre-sell the process and mechanisms.

**Video Source:** source: 3k per week.txt

**Content:** Offers should focus on the client's transformation, not your past achievements.  Brevity and clarity are key; the offer is a bridge to their future state.  Use content to build context and pre-sell the process and mechanisms.  By the time they reach the offer, they should already believe you can solve their problem.  Focus on the promise and what happens *to them*.

## Creating Compelling Offers: Empathy, Tangibility, and Relief

**Summary:** Kemp emphasizes empathy in understanding client desires, highlighting the importance of selling an experience and articulating a tangible, better tomorrow. He advises focusing on selling relief and making the offer a bridge to that relief.

**Video Source:** source: 3k per week.txt

**Content:**  Empathy is crucial for understanding client desires. Sell an experience, not just features.  Make the offer tangible by describing the physical experience of the desired outcome or the removal of the problem.  Focus on selling relief—a better tomorrow—and make the offer a clear path to that relief.  Tangibility and a clear vision make offers easy to sell.

## Offer Distinction and Positioning: Standing Out in Competitive Markets

**Summary:**  Kemp discusses the importance of offer distinction in competitive markets, suggesting focusing on being the easiest option if you can't be the best. He advises using unique naming and framing the offer as an "install" to reduce the perception of labor.

**Video Source:** source: 3k per week.txt

**Content:**  In competitive markets, distinction is key.  If you can't be the best, be the easiest.  Use unique naming and frame your offer as an "install," reducing the perception of labor.  Develop a monopoly on your unique mechanism or process.  Content builds context, establishing your expertise and making the offer a natural next step.

## Pricing for Conversions and Economics: The Path of Least Resistance

**Summary:** Kemp advocates for pricing that maximizes conversions and economics, often meaning being among the cheapest but most accessible in the market. He advises against high pricing driven by ego and emphasizes the power of $100 offers.

**Video Source:** source: 3k per week.txt

**Content:** Price for maximum conversions and economics.  Accessibility is key; often, the cheapest offers are the most effective.  Avoid inflated pricing driven by ego or status seeking.  There's a magic to $100 offers; they work exceptionally well.  Focus on delivering value and earning the right to experiment with higher pricing later.

## The 6-Month Plan: Principles, Playbooks, and Client Ascension

**Summary:** Kemp outlines a 6-month plan for building a sustainable, scalable business, focusing on the principles of market selection, offer creation, and client ascension. He introduces playbooks for execution and emphasizes the importance of volume and speed in skill development.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:**  The plan involves selecting the right market, creating a compelling offer, and building an ecosystem for client ascension.  Playbooks provide actionable steps.  Volume and speed enhance skill development; the more you do, the faster you learn and improve.  Focus on leveraged actions that compound over time.  Everything works with enough volume and iteration.

## Managing Expectations and Pacing: Sustainable Growth and Reduced Volatility

**Summary:**  Kemp advises setting a sustainable pace and managing expectations, emphasizing the importance of slow, steady growth to reduce volatility and avoid burnout. He recommends using time as a variable and focusing on the process, not just the outcome.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** Define a sustainable pace.  Processes take time; reverse engineer from your goals and set a pace you can sustain.  Manage expectations, especially around speed of return.  Slow, steady growth reduces volatility and prevents burnout.  Use time to your advantage; the slower you grow, the higher your revenue floor and the lower your volatility.

## Dynamic Offers and Client Lifetime Value: Maximizing Potential

**Summary:** Kemp discusses maximizing client lifetime value by offering multiple tiers and crediting previous investments. He encourages open communication about different program levels and making upgrades and downgrades natural and tension-free.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** Display different program levels early and often.  Credit previous investments to encourage upgrades.  This injects potential energy into the system and makes ascension conversations easier.  Make it personal and work out custom payment plans based on credits.  This approach maximizes client lifetime value and fosters long-term relationships.


## Addressing Client Questions and Objections: Handling "Not Now"

**Summary:** Kemp advises addressing client questions directly and handling objections by taking the offer off the table, creating space for honest feedback. He emphasizes the value of a "not now" response and using it as an opportunity for further conversation.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:**  Address client questions directly, preferably in writing.  Handle objections by taking the offer off the table.  This reduces pressure and encourages honest feedback.  A "not now" response is valuable; it indicates understanding of the offer.  Use it as an opportunity to offer alternative solutions or address their specific barriers.

## Metrics and Ratios for Success: Tracking Progress and Diagnosing Issues

**Summary:** Kemp shares target metrics for customer and client conversion rates (15% and 3% of email list, respectively). He emphasizes the importance of self-diagnosis and using the provided frameworks to identify areas for improvement.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** Aim for 15% customer conversion and 3% client conversion from your email list.  These ratios are generally achievable and sustainable.  Develop the ability to self-diagnose issues.  Use the provided frameworks to identify areas for improvement, whether it's offer clarity, volume, pacing, or messaging.  The goal is to empower you to identify and address your own bottlenecks.

## Proximity to Money

**Summary:**  To maximize earnings, position yourself as close as possible to the creation, discovery, keeping, and transfer of money. Choosing a less lucrative market is not a moral failing; align your market choice with your desires, skills, and permissions.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** You need to be as close to money as possible, as close to the creation of money as possible, as close to the discovery of money as possible as close to the keeping of money as possible, and as close to the transfer of money as possible. The further you are away from money, the less money you potentially make. This is just the reality, right? And that is not to be looked through a moral lens. Because if you choose a market that makes less money than a market that makes more money, that is not a reflection on you at any moral or practical point. Someone who makes a million dollars a year is not fundamentally a better human being than someone who makes a hundred thousand, right? And in the online world, people link outcomes with morality and goodness, and it means that it often steers people towards places that they either don't want to be, or they have no business in, or they're chasing false idols. So not everyone can or should consciously select the most economically advantageous market. If you wanted to do that all the time you would be opportunity hopping all the time to seek the immediate financial opportunity. There's in markets, for example, right now you'd be selling crypto signals and crypto courses, because that is where the attention flows right. But the reality is that everybody is going to inhabit different marketplaces and positions based on them, their desire, who they want to serve, what problems they've solved before, and ultimately, what you have either the internal or the market permission to do. And this is where we must start, and unless we want to throw out our previous skill set and throw everything away, we have to work with what we have. And the starting point is with a modern brand is that sociological start point. And the start point dictates your current conditions, and your orientation dictates your current direction. Like, think of my path into helping people make money right. I was an entrepreneur, a marketing director. Then I did consulting. I helped people make money at different points all along the way, so I have been very close to the making, the creation, the spending of money all along. So I am in a very advantageous financial position, because I have stayed close to the creation of money for half my life. Right? I've sold things. I've marketed, I've helped people sell things. I've helped people market things. I've helped people build things. I've helped people grow things. I've helped people create things. All of those things were one or two, or three, or sometimes the direct acquisition of money, or they were the direct acquisition of things that give money, like customers, or businesses, or audiences, or whatever they may be, right. So it is very natural for me to do the thing that I do, and be in the place that I am because of the skill set that I have and the and the experience that I inhabit. Right now today we have the past, and all leading up to here is the choice that what we do with that, and how we package it and direct it.


## Sociological vs. Psychological Business Approach

**Summary:** A sociological business prioritizes your own energy, interests, and desires, building upon your existing skills and experience. This contrasts with a psychological business, which focuses on market demand and data, often leading to chasing trends and compromising personal values.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** So your sociological start point is developing the human structure driven by the human energy. So mostly yours in the beginning. So I've talked about this, you know, a lot. But the a sociological business is sovereign because it prioritizes your own energy, your interests and your desires over those of the market. Right, it is. You create it from the sheer reality is that the Internet has allowed us to find people like us who believe and have the same similar values and similar characters than we do. So it is created in the trust that we can find those people, and they value the same things as us. So this is in contrast to the psychological start point in the market where people go out there and (ask) what does the market want? What does the market, what will the market buy? What does the research say? And what does the data say? Right? So we start with, who do I want to be? A psychological business starts with, who do I need to be, you know, and in the Internet space plenty of people become chameleons in the chase of money. And we start with, what do I want to sell? And they start with what, what will people buy? Right, again, we can choose a marketplace that is, you know, hot and you know, available right now and jump into it because it's an opportunity. But that doesn't mean that we should play in it. They, we start with what I want this to feel like, and they start with what must they do, right? And this is the contrast of the trust that the money, which is the scoreboard of business, comes if we operate with the natural laws that we inhabit, rather than force ourselves into marketplaces or chasing things that we may not be ultimately, naturally aligned with, or ultimately qualified for. So when we get, when we're doing the thing that we're meant to do, you know, I know my purpose, right, and I'm giving everybody permission to find and seek and accept theirs. If you don't know what it is, stop and listen, is all I'll say. If you know what it is, then, then following it is the path, right? Because then we can operate in a place of curiosity. And interestingly, the money comes in that magical way that the universe does reward us when we're in flow. A sociological brand polarizes, and it's done so naturally, because we talk in the, in the way that is natural to us, to the people that we naturally want to be around, and we repel the others. So a sociological brand serves itself first, and in turn it serves the market by doing that, and it trusts it's serving the market by serving itself. You are the first customer of your brand. The simple lens to look through this: the more I do what I want, the more I am rewarded for that across multiple domains. The more I do what feels right, and then apply a strategic lens to it, the more money I make, the more relationships I build, the more value I create, and the more impact I ultimately deliver, allowing me to do more of those things again. And they all compound, right?


## Building a Sociological Brand: Identity, Mechanism, and Messaging

**Summary:**  A successful sociological brand needs a unique mechanism for client results, a clear identity clients aspire to, and content that offers glimpses into your past, present, and future.  Actively repelling those who aren't your ideal client is also crucial.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** At a practical level, you know, when we have chosen and or not chosen, answered the calling, then layering over practical things is the path forward because it actually manifests those ideas out into the marketplace. Right? So very simply, we have an identity that we can help people transform into and escape the place that they're in and fulfill their desires. We are very clear about what happens when people step into our world. We are very clear about what transformations they undergo, and we are very clear about what they are currently experiencing that they're dissatisfied with, because we know those things already, because they are often part of us. The second, I'd say maybe the first, but one of the critical pieces is having a mechanism that gets a client result in the marketplace of ideas. Being unique is better than being better, right? So having a unique mechanism is a crucial attention seeker and, and, and it allows us to sell the idea of the transformation before the transformation is necessarily undertaken, undertaken or taken place inside our world that we call a client, right? So we need a unique mechanism. We have to be clear about the identity that we, that we have, you know, all the way, maybe to all the way, practically to actually labeling that, that identity. And we're clear about where people are coming from and doing that, and then we wrap a world around that, and we expose what we are comfortable with in that journey to tell those two stories that A, you're someone who can help transform people, and B, you have a way to do it through your unique mechanism. So you're letting people glimpse into the past, your current present, and a future through the content you produce. Right? And if you want proper depth in this, and I encourage you to go back, I've encouraged a few people to go back and watch it, to actually understand more depth in it. And I will, I will also do this again in, in 2025 in terms of, to expand on the brand and authority and world building and identity and mechanism, because they are the scaffolding and the framework that hangs off everything. Go and watch the authority which is in the, in the community. The piece that is counterintuitive, but will naturally happen through the course of this, is that you are clear who you are not for, and you actively repel them in your message. Right? And this, repelling does not need to be explicit, right? It can just take a counter position and a narrative on something that is potentially controversial, or is obvious that it will initiate disagreement in a sector or subsector of the market. A working example of that is yesterday I made a video and wrote something about coaching being dead. And it's not, but it's a good headline, and I talked about mentorship. So I drew attention to a point and a, and a semantic point that I wanted to make through the polarization of a whole group of people who want to argue that coaching definitely isn't dead, and they're definitely very good coaches and why can't I see that, etc., etc. And I'm not participating in the argument, but I'm just talking to the people now who are like, thank you for reframing some things that I've seen and thought and heard, but I haven't been able to articulate. And can we talk about that a lot more because I took a position on something, right, and I'm not here to argue with the people who want to argue for it. I'm here to talk to the people who want to understand that more and how it might ultimately might apply to them. So we take positions in the marketplace that we strongly believe and we can stand on, not to be contrarian and controversial for any particular attention seeking reason, just to surface and articulate things that we know people are thinking to enable a conversation around. So in summary, you know, the checklist is you have at least one unique mechanism, you craft an identity that clients aspire to become, you are letting them glimpse into your past, present, and future through content you produce, and you are clear who you are not for, and actively repelling your message.


## The Power of Transparency and Truth in Content

**Summary:** In a low-trust environment, transparency is key.  Honest and truthful content, even if not perfectly crafted, attracts the right people by authentically showcasing your experience and values.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** The nature of the game these days is, in a low trust environment, is transparency. Communication doesn't need to be good if communication is total. And saying that another way, you don't need to be a good copywriter, or have the skills of content creation, or editing, or making things look pretty or anything, if you are prepared to tell the truth in your content. If you are prepared to tell the unvarnished truth, you don't need to be a wordsmith. You don't need to be articulate. You don't even need to be charismatic. You just need to be honest and true, and people will see that, and they will, they will be attracted towards it because you, you are, you are essentially showing, as much as you can through the, through the methodology of digital content, the true experience of what it would be like to be you and ultimately be around you. So the framework of this and the lens that we look through is, if we do this and we commit to it, we sell people on ideas, right? If people are sold on those ideas, they will ultimately be simultaneously sold on us, and ultimately the right people will be simultaneously sold on working with us. Right? I don't do much selling of offers. I do a lot of selling of ideas which then enables me to easily invite people into my offers. I get comments regularly that I just kind of make it look easy and effortless, and it's because of this, because I don't sell, I don't push, I don't coerce, I don't close, because I put my energy into insight, coming out with ideas, helping people apply them, making them work for myself, demonstrating those, and people see those ideas, and over a long enough period of time, the right people say, can I have some help with that? Right?


## The Bedrock of an Effortless High-Velocity Business

**Summary:** The key to a successful business is focusing on selling ideas, not offers.  By demonstrating valuable insights and their application, you attract the right clients who naturally seek your help.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** Right? You know, the famous question, this is the bedrock of not everything, but this is the bedrock of having an effortless high velocity business and whatever, you know, domain it is. The semantics around coaching, consulting, and, and mentorship will, you know, go well beyond my, my death. But you know, I'll be there for the, I'll be there for the discussion.


## Understanding Power Laws in Client Value and Ascension

**Summary:** Client value isn't linear; power laws dictate that a small percentage of clients will contribute a disproportionately large amount of revenue. Recognizing and working with these power laws is crucial for maximizing business outcomes.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** I've developed a new way of looking at client value and ascension. And I don't say that lightly, and it was just, again, it was a change of lens. I've been talking about power laws for a very long time because my observation after serving thousands of people and, you know, and, and, and also my career selling hundreds of millions of dollars of product and seeing what happened, what, what the actual behavior behind the scenes was, is that power laws are present in buying and selling in, in, in almost everything. Results are not linear at all. Right? So in our world, all clients are not created equal. The power laws are absolutely everywhere, right? And I can now spot when people are fighting against them because they're taking a linear approach, or whether they're working with them because they're taking a, an approach that looks through the lens of a power law. So we either work with them or we fight against them. The difference between them is very, very stark. And again, this is why I see businesses struggling in markets that are, are valid and effective with valid skills, valid products, etc., because they take a linear approach to the market and see diminishing returns, and then they get exhausted through it. So show me someone who's brute forcing the hours and the effort, and I'll show you someone who is running laps around them with just like almost doing nothing. The difference between working with reality or against it is gigantic, right? So when we put a lot of effort into things, that doesn't mean we're going to get a return because it's relative to the, the law that we're actually operating under. So while a ton, and I've observed this for a long time, a ton of effort in this space goes into signing clients, very little effort goes into considering how much that client wants and needs from you, and what they will ultimately spend. There are just assumptions all the way down because you have a $10,000 offer, then you were looking for $10,000 people. The reality is that 99% of the people in the audience are not $10,000 people, and the 1% of people in the audience might be a hundred thousand dollar people, and you're leaving 90 grand, you know, per unit on the table. So the difference between these things is exponential in the outcome of the, of the business, right?


## Maximizing Client Value through an Ecosystem Approach

**Summary:**  Instead of focusing on individual sales, build an ecosystem where clients can naturally find their value level. This involves conceptualizing revenue buckets and facilitating client ascension based on their needs and willingness to pay.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** So if we have ways and lenses to look at maximizing client value, then the clients will settle in their natural place relative to all the different factors, and timing is a huge one as well. Right, desire to pay, levels of access, you know, how much they value proximity to you or your team, or whatever your setup is, and how fast they ultimately want to go. So I've started looking at client relationships in the, in the, not in terms of interpersonal relationships, but in terms of value based relationships where a value transfer happens between information and access and money through the lens of annualized value. So that allows us to create an ecosystem. When, after we make the first sale, we put the effort into making it easy to start and easy to get going. Then the client can find their natural place in our ecosystem because we've built it in such a way. So we can do this by conceptualizing revenue buckets that clients can fit into in the process, and that makes filling up these buckets natural. Do not, I think my drawings actually getting worse, not better. I think, I think I need to take some kind of iPad pills or something, but do not get hung up on the numbers, understand it as a concept, right? And so when we're looking at, when we're looking at revenue buckets, the earlier you are in the journey, you know, and I've put, I've put constraints on this in terms of bounds of a million, 3 million, 6 million. The earlier you are on the journey, the narrower and smaller you want those individual buckets. So we start from essentially, if you're looking at on a scale in the middle. So we have a small number of buckets that we fill up with ultimately with clients. We can do that with a singular offer. We can do that with the hybrid offer plus a couple of things that I'm going to talk about to ultimately fill up those buckets to keep it simple. The, the larger the business and the larger your goals and the larger the scale you achieve, the more you have to expand those buckets. Right? I'm now exploring the outer bounds of this concept where I have clients who, who are exceeding a hundred thousand dollars annualized value, and I am being forced to come up with ways to serve them and the desires and the problems they have. Right? So that is client driven. "James, I want your help in setting up overseas and saving. I just paid a $700,000 tax bill," right? That is client driven by solving 20 problems along the way to get there. So they had that problem, and then they are now stretching the annualized value that, that they can ultimately achieve, and I can ultimately capture. So the earlier you are in the journey, the less buckets you want, and the smaller and the more concentrated those buckets are because you just want to fill them up. So one or two tiers is, is ultimately optimal, and I'm going to give you examples in a minute to, to show how this plays out in the, in real, the hybrid. Does that, right? So simplicity scales, and the less offers you have, the more that the offer has space to be optimized.


## Growth vs. Scale on the Path to $1 Million

**Summary:**  On the path to a million-dollar business, prioritize growth through experimentation and iteration.  Once you have a proven offer with a high conversion rate, shift to a scale phase focused on volume.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** I've talked again a lot about the difference between growth and scale. On the road to a million dollars a year, which everybody is capable of, then you are spending much more time in growth than scale. Growth is, the metaphor is throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, right? That is how optimization happens. It happens through experiments and action and repeated actions and reps, right? In a growth phase, you never stop moving because you're always learning and iterating and trying to remove the pieces that aren't working. And then once you hit an inflection point of, I have things that work, I have an offer that when I send to people, 30% of people buy it, then you can be in a scale phase where you feed people into that and you're looking for volume. On the, on the journey up, those scale phases don't last for very long until you, you will hit a constraint or a bottleneck of diminishing returns and whether the offer or something needs slight engineering or tweaking to keep, to optimize, to ultimately grow. And those are the points where a lot of people stall out, and you'll hear people saying, "I'm stuck at X revenue. I'm stuck at this." And it's because they haven't switched from a growth phase to a scale phase, or they think they're on a scale phase, but they're actually in a growth phase, and they need to re-engineer the offers or some of the finances towards the marketplace.


## The Hybrid Offer and Client Value Ascension

**Summary:**  Use a hybrid offer and a stacked ecosystem to reveal potential ascension paths for clients. This allows clients to naturally find their value level within your ecosystem, leading to higher average client value and retention.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** So how does it actually play out? That, that plays out in a reality that on day one of a relationship with a client, it is difficult to discern, truly discern whether a client is a thousand dollar person or a hundred thousand dollar person. The only way we, we discern that is by showing them the path to do so, right? And then the thousand, thousand, probably in hindsight, it's a bit extreme of an example. You can discern, you know, roughly what bucket they're in, but you know, if you can't tell between a thousand, a hundred thousand dollar person, then there might not be enough signals to go on. So we use the hybrid offer and the stack, we can show people the potential path forward. So what I have done and what I have experimented with and nailed in my own business, and then helped people apply, is I have very power law based experience because the next step for people is always natural, so that has led to very, very high average client value. And that's also led to very high retention because I have a myth, a methodology which allows people to naturally move forward to the place that they need to be, but also naturally move backwards to settle at a level without them ultimately leaving a community or a product or, etc. And saying in other ways, I've worked out how to get the most amount of money out of clients while delivering, out of clients for delivering the maximum result. And I've also worked out a way to pretty much ensure that most people don't leave because they have something for them. So scenario one, a common scenario: They join the community, they pay in full off the back of, you know, an offer, they enjoy the experience, I credit that experience against the syndicate, and they step up into it. I credit the full experience. I actually work out a custom payment for them based on the credit, so they're not paying the full amount. They feel that they've got a credit, which is again potential energy in there, and they step up into the syndicate, and they're on a lower payment than they would be at a kind of market rate, and they've got that natural experience. That is a very common flow, just by crediting what someone has previously purchased against the next step. Right? And I'm in the process of engineering that across the board in the business to make that natural. So anybody, no matter how long they've been in there, can benefit from, from that progress in that state, so they can settle in their naturals, in their natural place. That also, this also means that in the inverse, that someone could actually join the syndicate for a period of time and step back down to the community because under the, the nature of that offer, they might spend 3 months in the syndicate, and then they step down, and they've still got, you know, 9 or 8 months, you know, in the community, and they're still actually ultimately there and part of it. Right?


##  Leveraging Small Initial Investments for High Client Value

**Summary:** By strategically structuring your ecosystem and crediting previous purchases, you can transform small initial commitments into significantly higher value client relationships.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** So this is another scenario that's played out. And so that, that scenario there has an annualized value of about $20,000 for a person if they stay for the whole duration of that. Like that's the, you know, the actual ultimate example. Bear in mind, the first touch point that that person had when joining my world was they were probably attracted by someone, something that said, "Join for a hundred dollars." So I have taken that commitment or that interest of a figure around a hundred dollars and then established that the client will actually spend $20,000, right? There's an order of magnitude different in the actual client value. And this is why we isolate that when we look at offers, we isolate the ability to convert someone versus having an ecosystem that they step into where they ultimately expand. There are plenty of people who have gone through the classic ascension from me, who have downloaded a free lead magnet, bought a $10 book, joined $100 a week community, and then ascended all the way up to the Circle at $800 a week. So again, same scenario, client joins the community, then moves between levels based on how much proximity and access they need at the time. And again, this is a real scenario, actually. One of my one-on-one clients finished this week, and as you know, dropped back down to a level that we both agree is right from after, you know, a 10 week period of, of one-on-one. So joins the community, goes to the syndicate, goes to the circle, opts for a period of one-on-one, then comes back to the circle, right? So we ultimately have, you know, someone who is worth $51,000 across 52 weeks because we have places to take them and places to go. Two different examples, four people at two different distinct stages. But ultimately, if we look at an ecosystem where we're looking at annualized value, and then our offers naturally fit together, what we stand to do is, is find the maybe half a dozen clients who are currently paying a few hundred or a few thousand dollars and actually establish that they are, they have a propensity to pay there, of a willingness to pay, and they have a desire for speed or something to be done right now that transforms them into 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or $50,000 relationships. In my experience, in a client, you know, in a, in a cohort of clients, if you've got 10 of them, one of those people is probably prepared to pay a hundred times more than they're currently paying. And so having an ecosystem and understanding that is a dramatic change in the business because the power laws are extreme, absolutely extreme. You know, I'm knocking on the door of 40 people who have contributed half my revenue this year. And if you look at the whole client base, that isn't 80/20, that isn't 90/10. It's somewhere in the region of like 94/6 or something like that as a power law kind of ratio. You know, 6% of the clients are ultimately contributing half the revenue. It's, it's not even close to linear, right?


## Practical Steps for Implementing an Ecosystem

**Summary:**  Communicate your various program levels early and often, making them real in your marketing and content.  Crediting previous investments towards future purchases injects potential energy into the system, encouraging client ascension.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** So in terms of, today's not intended to be too practical, it's, you know, understand the principles behind it. But a practical piece is engineering. This is rooted in displaying the levels early and often. Again, what you've seen me demonstrate is I talk about my client programs a lot. I make them real, and I make them thing, I make them real in my marketing, in my content. I make them real inside the communities, and I make people aware that they ultimately exist. And if I display the levels early and often, it means people have an understanding of the ecosystem and that they can either move upwards and get more access to me, but also move downwards for, you know, at, at different times. So simply, the more I communicate it and the more I talk about the different programs and those things and reference them and, and, and you know, even talk about them in kind of, in a, in a semi mechanistic way, clients know there are different levels inside, and it makes that upgrade or that downgrade conversation very easy and very natural without any tension and without any fear of losing anything, or fear of being sold to as well. At a very simple level, again, this is quite practical, crediting previous investment and future investment is the simplest way to protect, inject potential energy in the system. Right now, if you go to your clients and say, "I will credit all previous investment that you've got against this next thing," essentially, you are writing a check and putting it in their hand, right? Money and credits are potential energy. The, you'll see this happen this month at Christmas time when those people who are impossible to buy for, or children who live miles away from their grandparents, get gift cards. When my kids get gift cards for something, they are like stored up potential energy like, "I want to go to the shop and spend. I want to go. I want to go. I want to go," right? They have potential spending power that they have been given, and they want to use it. My children are not alone in that. Adults also do that where the potential energy that you can still, that you can give people by giving them a credit for their previous investment is essentially stored up and allows them to use it. Some will use it immediately, and some will store it up well into the future. I have essentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential energy stored up across my customer and client base that will just slow, that slowly be deployed. It was deployed yesterday. I credited against a 5K experience. I credited 2,400, and they paid 2,600, right? Potential energy stored up and, and then is utilized, which then creates more cash flow into the business.


## Offer Structure for Different Revenue Goals

**Summary:**  For a $1 million goal, one offer with two levels and a clear ascension path is sufficient.  As revenue goals increase, develop a front-end offer and an inner circle for a larger client base.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** So what do we need? On the way to 1 million, we need one offer with two levels, right? And then if you have, have a, a simple ascension between those two levels, and potentially, you know, extras with that people can purchase like hours, or done for you, or anything like that as a one-off, then you have everything you need to get to that milestone. As we expand into higher revenue levels, we need a higher, a higher degree of conversion out of the audience. So we need to develop a front-end offer, and we need to develop some kind of inner circle once our client base exceeds 40 to 50 people. Again, I'll talk about the exact things and, and the plan next week that these, this is the principles behind it.


## The Importance of Gratification and Managing Expectations

**Summary:**  Business growth is not linear, and our tendency towards instant gratification can lead to disappointment and quitting.  Manage expectations by focusing on the process and understanding that results are a lag indicator of accumulated behavior.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** I've been thinking a lot, as in over the course of years, about why some people get results and some people don't, and some, and why also the phenomena of people who get results quit along the way because they're dissatisfied with the result they're getting. And it all came back to that, the idea of gratification and in the course of doing things, in the course of executing on something or working on something, and the more obsessed you are with something, the more you value the return from it, and you need feedback from it. And again, like the map is, is not the terrain. The math of achieving like different revenue levels is easy to write down. Right? I can, I can put math on a page and point to that and go, "Go in, just do $2,739 a day. Go, just go and do it, right, that's it. And you'll do a million dollars a year," right? Easy. But it's flat, like in the act of doing that 365 times, a lot of shit happens, right? You want to make 3 million a year? Okay, all you need to do is make $57,692 a week. Like you can do that. Just go and do it. Math. So math is very flat, and when we get out into the world, our experience is not linear, right? And, and growth is not linear either. So let's start with some concepts. Recurring revenue businesses are the, are the most robust over the long term, right? And I've been very honest that for the most part of this year, I've coasted from a revenue growth kind of acquisition. I hit the number I wanted to hit, and then this was like, "Sweet, like I don't have to put a hell of a lot more energy into this. I can just oscillate and maintain around that, around that pace." And I will go, you know, as someone who's obsessed, it's weird, weird to say this, but I will go days without thinking much about the business. I will just be operating on it and, and inside it. And then I'll look at the Stripe account, and it's got six or seven or $8,000 in it, and I'll go, "Okay, cool. Yeah, sweet. It's still there, right? It's still, it's, it's, it's still there. It's still coming," because that revenue was booked and sold months, weeks, months, or in some cases, you know, years ago. So recurring revenue businesses are the most robust over the long time, over the long term.


## The Paradox of Recurring Revenue

**Summary:** While recurring revenue offers long-term robustness, it's important to remember that it's not guaranteed. The only true revenue is the money collected today, and lowering revenue volatility is crucial for emotional stability and effective operation.

**Video Source:** source: 6m Plan.txt

**Content:** The paradox is that recurring revenue does not arrive in the amounts expected, and the revenue you collect now is the only true revenue. Give me one minute. Someone's locked two dogs in the office with me. I'll be, be tense. Yeah, don't, don't edit that out, Alex. It's just, it's just stupid. I wonder why they were getting so grumpy around the corner. Recurring revenue is a difficult concept, and I, and I dug into that, you know, a couple of workshops ago around the acquisition of it because it doesn't happen how people think it does, right? And the, the reality is that the only true revenue is now revenue. The only true revenue is the money you collect today that settles and ultimately, you know, comes into your business bank account because when we sell our product that is intended to recur, we are incurring our future liability to deliver on that. And also we are incurring an expectation that if someone says they're gonna be there for 12 months and they're paying, "See the tab. People tag," week, but they will be there for 12, "Week," again. That doesn't often happen. So the, the classic, you know, the map is not the terrain that kneecaps most everybody because they're like, "I've got recurring revenue, you know, it's gonna keep coming." And then it's a lot more volatile than people think, and volatility is the thing we must lower. So this is the most important sentence that I will say in the, in this section

## Congratulations on Engagement

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses his recent engagement and the nuances of relationship labels in the modern world.

**Video Source:** Authority workshop.txt

**Content:**
We were joking this morning in the modern world. You know you have girlfriend, you have, partner, you have all these words, and you never quite know what fits and like when I call her my partner. I just feel like it's my homosexual life partner. and go. Doesn't seem quite fitting, so Fiance's just. I think so.


## Book Funnels: What They Are and What They Aren't

**Summary:** James Kemp explains the purpose of a client-getting book, emphasizing its role in selling a simple idea and creating customers who can be converted into clients.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
Gonna talk about books! What they are, what they aren't as I think the idea that people have in their head of what a book is, I believe, stops most people starting. and the what they can do and what you need to add to them to get to turn them into a long term. Asset is is powerful. So what a book is and isn't. And I, this is this is the big one because I got stuck here. You know, back in the day of like this is a book. and this is a client. The the reference we're talking about today is a client getting book. It is not your autobiography by Walter Isaacson. That's not one that you give to your grandmother. It's not one that you read to your kids. It is not your life story. Maybe one day you'll do that. The the goal of this book is to sell them on a simple idea. And that's why the definition of this book can be brought down to, you know, a 30 to 50 page book that someone consumes and sells them on the idea. And in many cases I've seen and also done converting a long lead magnet into a short book. Because it already works can be an effective way of thinking about it as well. The second piece of like what the book does is it sells an idea. The goal of the book is to sell just one of your ideas right? And you, you all of you, have more than one.


## The Power of a Book: Selling Ideas and Creating Customers

**Summary:**  A book effectively sells an idea, making potential clients more receptive to the author. It also creates a customer base that can be nurtured into long-term clients through further engagement and offers.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So once someone has bought into the idea that makes them more likely to buy into you. You know, I talk a lot about we sell ideas first, st and we sell. You know we sell clients. Second. but the book is there to sell them on the idea. So the book doesn't hold back from the things that are required to sell the to sell the idea. It has everything it needs to sell the idea. But that's that's the only goal of it. And of course, in the in the sovereign world. What a book does is it creates a customer. Once a book is sold it creates a customer, and we turn those customers into clients. The book fulfills more of the criteria, just like workshops do or or anything that's got a high level of consumption. The more time on Brand, and the more time that someone spends consuming you, consuming your ideas. the easier they are to convert into becoming a client, and the longer they stay in your world. you know. We've been talking a little bit over the last couple of weeks about content. You know my Youtube strategy and my video strategy. And that's about, you know, brand Width, it's about getting people on brand and consuming one or some or all of the ideas that you have. So by the time that they're reaching out, or you're having a conversation about an offer. they are already sold on those things, and you are the origin of them.


## Books as Evergreen Assets and Client Generation Tools

**Summary:** Books are highly evergreen marketing assets, remaining relevant and effective for years. They offer excellent value and can generate clients even without complex funnels, though distribution and economics are key for maximizing their potential.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So in the Internet space. And in in the online space the rate of change is super super high, like things come and go and they fizzle out and they disappear really, really, quickly, and their effectiveness and a book is an interesting one, because as an asset, it's 1 of the most evergreen I can't actually think of an asset that's more evergreen than a book, really, because even a workshop or a webinar would need a that can, that they can feasibly run for years, they still need to be changed and refreshed and updated where there are plenty of examples of books that are 10 or even 15 years old that are still selling in the market today.


## Creating a Book: A Simpler Process Than You Think

**Summary:** Creating a client-getting book is often simpler than anticipated, frequently achievable in a weekend or less by compiling existing materials. The most time-consuming aspect is editing for readability and usability.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So how do we create a book? It is a lot simpler than you think. The creation of all my books has been done in a weekend or less right because they were. They were compiled, and amalgamations of things that are already done honestly, that the most of the time spent on books is editing. So editing is just making it readable and making it usable. And once you've got a baseline down then most of the time is making it editable, making it readable and making it consumable.


## How-To Books and Mechanism Books: Delivering Results and Converting Clients

**Summary:** How-to books that provide complete solutions are most effective for client conversion.  Books focused on a single mechanism are also highly effective, especially for problem-oriented solutions.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So I I believe that the best books and I have found that the best books are how to books. They give everybody. They give somebody everything they need to ultimately fulfill on the idea. So they tell them. You tell them how to do the thing so they could spend $10 with you and do that, or they could spend a hundred grand with you, and you know, and get you to do it for them. So books that hold back create customers that will hold back on you. So if you leave out the secret ingredients or leave out the key thing out of the book. You will find that that book doesn't ultimately convert people books that give people everything in terms of the central idea and the central concepts. you know, indoctrinate people the most and create the highest caliber of person.


## Two Types of Client-Getting Books: Big Idea vs. Single Mechanism

**Summary:** Client-getting books can be categorized into two main types: "Big Idea" books that encompass a comprehensive vision, and "Mechanism" books that focus on a specific strategy or process. Both types can be effective, but Mechanism books often sell better due to their immediate problem-solving nature.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So there's 2 types of books that we can create. The 1st one is the big idea. You know the one that completely sells them and if you want to get more context on the sovereign consultant and the pieces of how I assembled that watch the authority training in the classroom. but the big idea completely sells them on your whole vision, your whole world, who they who they can become what they need, what they need to do next, and and ultimately how they do it. The the why, what, how, so? The sovereign consultant is A is an example of a big idea book. It's a big idea that creates you know the idea of what a sovereign consultant is. what they need to do to do it, and actually how to do it. As they unpack the chapters. So you know, the the Big Idea book is more of the book than our book, you know, you know, slightly contradicting what I said before, but it's it's ultimately the the big idea. the second type of book which I'm confident that 80% of you have now is a book that's just about a single mechanism.


## From Trainings to Books: Leveraging Existing Content

**Summary:**  Existing training materials and workshops can be easily repurposed into books. Transcribing workshops and blending them with training documents provides a substantial base for a book, requiring primarily editing and structuring.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So the sovereign consultant book is actually created from 4 trainings. So there's a software consultant the the simplest path to a million dollars profit a year. You can see that training. You can see that it's got a Google Doc attached to it. The hybrid offer customers to clients in the data client machine. So, as I said, I will create 3 more books based on those mechanisms. So I will have essentially an interconnected world of books that that point to each other and cross reference each other. Because I've already actually got the baseline of those books. So what I did is, I created a training. I ran the workshop. I got the workshop transcribed, and then I blended the the original training Doc, because I do my trainings in in Google Docs. And I blended that with the transcript of the of the workshop. The average hour long workshop generates about 17 to 24,000 words depending on how fast you speak. That's a book right? There is editing required, but you can have something usable and actually drop it into drop it into those, and I'm going to give you the book and the outline, and in a more readable and raw format.


## Simplifying the Book Creation Process: Focusing on Client Acquisition

**Summary:**  Client-getting books should be viewed as enhanced lead magnets or condensed workshops, focusing on client acquisition rather than being complex literary works. This approach simplifies the process and allows for quicker client generation.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
This is a lead magnet on steroids or a reduction of a workshop. Right? And again, most people here have done both of those things, and the book is the happy middle ground in terms of the asset that is created from those, and also an asset that ultimately we can put into something that's got bit better economics.


## Chris Benetti on Book Funnels and Client Acquisition

**Summary:** Chris Benetti emphasizes the importance of viewing a book as a tool for client acquisition, rather than striving for a large, complex publication.  A shorter, focused book created quickly can be more effective for generating clients.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
I think the point you made, you know a book, not the book is is huge. I think that's a massive thing that most people just they see you know, all of the Russell Brunson's, and they see You know, Dan Martell, buy back your time, and they're like man. These books are massive, like we've got to do best seller and all this kind of crap. And it's just. you know, that's that's great for them, and where they're at, and their status in life, and what they're trying to accomplish. But for you, you most likely want to get clients from your book. And so the the book doesn't need to be. Doesn't need to be a thing, and it it should just be a a machine in the cog, for where you're at right now, and what you want to actually achieve from the book and I'm sure those guys get clients because they have these massive things that they're putting out there. But that's that's, you know, probably 2 years worth of work to create one of those assets and to to create a marketing campaign around that. And it's just like, you know, I'd rather you guys turn out a book in a weekend and get clients next week, you know.


## Framing Your Book Around Client Problems and Solutions

**Summary:** Chris Benetti advises focusing on the core problems clients face and creating a book that offers solutions and a clear path to working with you. This simple approach can be highly effective for client generation.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
and and I think it's more simple than we think. So the the thing from my perspective that I like to just talk about is is the frame. So a lot of a lot of people work with you guys because you have a solution to offer, and they're likely struggling with a core common problem. And so if we can just identify what that problem is, and then write a book that, you know talks about the solution right then and there, and then a pathway to how they can work with you to achieve that thing. Then that's a very simple cycle that we can control and create. And it doesn't need to be complicated.


## Mechanism Books, Client Acquisition, and the Path to Traditional Publishing

**Summary:** Mechanism-focused books often outperform big idea books in sales due to their problem-solving nature. A client-getting book can also pave the way for traditional publishing opportunities later on.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
Those the mechanism books actually sell better than the big Big idea books, because they're more immediate and they're more problem focused. So the daily client machine was very, very easy book to sell. It had a very high conversion rate, and it had a very high conversion rate off the back end, because the the this is how you get clients every day is a, you know, a common thing that's top of mind. So the mechanism books are a little bit easier to sell them, anyways, because they're more problem orientated and solution orientated than you know. A concept like the sovereign consultant where someone's going to look and look at what's that? Just to close off on the book idea? Our book can lead to the book. I've been approached by publishers twice over the years and said. You've got a book, and you've got an audience and you've got. Do you want to write a book? The book with us so. But I wouldn't have been able to have those conversations, and someone reach out until I had a book out there in the 1st place.


## Book Economics and the Importance of Distribution

**Summary:**  Maximizing book sales requires effective distribution, which in turn necessitates sound economics. The goal is to create a funnel that allows for paid traffic and ideally generates enough revenue to cover ad costs, making customer acquisition essentially free.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So the the book and the economics matter a lot like. Candidly, you could write a book, stand alone and not do any of the funnel things, put it on. Amazon. Run a basic funnel to it. You get clients right. It can be a really effective customer and client generation tool on its own. Like, you know, there's plenty of people have built pretty okay, little businesses just having a book and not thinking about any of the economics. But to maximize the book and the economics, we need to have distribution right to maximize any asset we need to have distribution. So we need maximum economics to maximize that distribution because we can do something that is the unicorn of of marketing. We can get the product to pay for itself. So we need to plan its economics and create a funnel which allows us to run paid traffic to the book.


## Self-Liquidating Book Funnels and Ad Tracker Transparency

**Summary:** James Kemp shares his ad tracker, demonstrating how a well-structured book funnel can be front-end profitable, covering ad costs and even generating profit.  Transparency in tracking, including agency fees, is crucial for understanding true funnel economics.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So the the simple goal we have for this is to generate enough revenue from the product sales to cover ad costs. So here's the tiny Tiny. He doesn't make it. This Tiny. He lets me read it. Here's the here's the the a snapshot of the ad tracker that Chris and his team do for do for me every day. So Alex uploads the the sales numbers, and then Chris puts the the ad spend in including his fee. and remember that, you know, when you're looking at outgoings. If you work with anybody in an agency, a lot of agencies will pretend that the fee doesn't exist, and it's just, you know, it's all gravy. But the but Chris puts his fee in here. So it's like super transparent about what the actual economics of the funnel is.


## The "More of the Same" Principle in Book Funnels

**Summary:**  Book funnels should offer additional products and resources that expand upon the core idea presented in the book. This "more of the same" approach caters to different consumption preferences and maximizes the value offered within the funnel.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
when I asked Chris yesterday, I'm like, What's the what's the message about the book funnel like? What's the how should people think about it? He said. Something that's, you know, very simple in terms of its concept, which is more of the same. If someone is buying the book. Then they are interested in the concept of the book and the problems it solves and the solutions it ultimately has. So what do you put on the in the funnel? You put more of that in there. Right you go deeper, you go wider, you add more additional pieces, and and you put more stuff in it.


##  A Simple Book Funnel Structure and its Conversion Metrics

**Summary:** James Kemp outlines a basic book funnel structure, including a lead capture, order form, bump offer, upsell, and downsell. He shares conversion rates for each stage, highlighting the importance of the bump offer in boosting overall funnel economics.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So this is the. This is the simple funnel. We have a lead when someone comes in, because they they enter their details. In the box before they buy the book, and then they're showing the the order form and the upsell. We have a bump which increases the economics immediately inside the car. We then have an upsell and a downsell I know Chris runs more complex book funnels than this, and I have before, where I've had multiple upsells, multiple downsells, and everything. I am confident that with the structure you can get all the economics you need out of a book funnel up to a thousand bucks a day in ad spend. If you get, you know, keep it simple and keep it right by swapping these things out.


## Book, Bump, Upsell, and Downsell Examples

**Summary:** James Kemp provides specific examples of his book, bump offer, upsell, and downsell, emphasizing the importance of clear messaging and offering additional value at each stage.  He highlights two effective bump offer strategies: behind-the-scenes walkthroughs and additional templates.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So the book is this, and we I'm giving you all these templates, and most of you have seen the book funnel. But I'm gonna give you the individual components so we can reverse engineer them for you. So the book, you know it does what it says on the tin. I've got a book there that talks about the suffering consultant, and obviously what you get. You know the playbook for building a million dollar per year. Solo consultancy with 65 clients or less than 2 days a week. So I'm super explicit about what it is and who it's for, and the byline, because no one really knows what a sovereign consultant is until I introduce the idea. So the bump is a really important one. You get the bump right? And you're most of the way to kind of solving the economics of this. So there's 2 bumps that have worked extremely well for me. There's a behind the scenes. Walkthrough.


## The First Upsell: A Key Signal of Client Intent

**Summary:** The first upsell in a book funnel is crucial not only for boosting revenue but also as a strong indicator of a customer's likelihood of becoming a client.  Those who invest in the upsell often demonstrate a higher level of commitment and desire for further assistance.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So the 1st upsell is the is the big one. This upsells priced at 200 bucks. and essentially it's a deep dive in terms of the concept and in terms of the contents of the book. So my 1st upsell is the 3 K code and the social code those bundled together. If someone was to buy them, you know, separately, as courses currently run for a thousand bucks, right? And I'm and I can. I'm giving it to them for 2 200 bucks. So there's not much more to say, apart from more of the same right. This is the the step by step, training or take, you, you know, show you how to make a 3 k. Offer. Take it to 3 KA week, and then 3 KA day. And again, the social code which talks about, you know the social, the social posts that we make, and and and ultimately, how we set those up.


## The Downsell: Simplifying the Offer and Maintaining Intent

**Summary:**  The downsell should be a simplified version of the first upsell, often unbundling the offer to provide a more accessible entry point.  This strategy captures those who are interested but not ready for the full upsell, while still maintaining a relatively high level of intent.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
Break up the upsell. Just make your life easy. Right? So if the if the if the 1st upsell is a bundle of things. break up the bundle and just offer one of them. So I we we cut. We. We chop up the social code and the 3 K code and say, Hey, wait! We've got. I really want you to have this. I really, I really need you to have this. I'm going to do it for a hundred bucks. and that converts obviously at a slightly higher level than even the upsell. So the people who are going through that again have relatively high intent


## Chris Benetti on Upsells, Downsells, and Consumption Formats

**Summary:** Chris Benetti explains the importance of offering different consumption formats in upsells and downsells.  People learn and absorb information differently, so providing varied options, such as video courses or action guides, can significantly increase conversions.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
I think you nailed a lot of the good points here. Just from a visitor perspective. from an upselling point of view. and people people like different formats of consumption, you know, like they'll get a book. And a book is like. we all know books are valuable there's no doubt about it. But how how tangible is it going to be for me to be able to, potentially, you know, get a step by step, action guide to implementing some of the strategies like, sure, there's going to be a level of that in a written format. But you know, I think the reason why James's upsells and downsells convert so well, you know, I think it's it's it's over 20% combined, which, if we think about that as a as an average, that's a hundred $50 average between the 2 like, that's a fantastic add on to the average order, value.


## Completeness in Offers and the Value of Transparency

**Summary:**  Offers, including books and upsells, should be complete and provide genuine value without holding back key information. This builds trust with clients and demonstrates a commitment to their success, leading to higher quality client relationships.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
They do. And again, it's that idea of completeness, you know. You can't hold back on this stuff. I don't think you can. I don't think you should hold back on any offer. But there there is. There has to be a sense and a and a and a and a real outcome of them being able to do it without you right. And it is really tempting to hold back on some of this stuff. But because you're like I want them to become a client. So I'm just gonna hold back on a little piece the best stuff, the stuff that just sells out the gates, you know, day, one is a how to book with everything it needs off the back of it. And the type of clients you get from that value. Input, they value perspective. And they value time, compression because they know that you're not holding back on them to try and manipulate them into. Oh, he's held back the last step. So I need to. I need to buy that thing. And then there's some tension there.


## Selling Off the Title: Clarity and Binary Offers

**Summary:**  The title of your book should clearly and concisely convey its core message, allowing potential buyers to quickly determine its relevance. This "selling off the title" approach creates a binary offer: either the title resonates, and they engage, or it doesn't, and they move on.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So before I before I move on to the ads, because there's a lot of variables there. I want to talk about selling off the title. When you look at a book funnel, and when you look at the the work required to do them. It can be kind of overwhelming, right? Oh, I need a lot of I need a lot of words. I need a lot of selling. I am the world's laziest man. and the concept that I always come to with products and offers is selling off the title right. If someone reads the title of the book. Then they get what it's about immediately. There is no abstraction, there is no vagueness. there is no, there's nothing left to say in that. The playbook for building a million dollar per year. Solo consultancy with 65 clients or less than 2 days a week. Right? It is binary right, and all the copy which is not copy is just words flows from there to handle the things that someone thinks about before they buy something. Right?


## Book Sales Page Structure: Addressing Common Questions

**Summary:**  The book sales page should expand on the title, addressing common questions potential buyers might have. This includes an origin story, current relevance, content overview, pricing, guarantee, and a clear call to action.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So the idea I want you to think about is selling off the title that it is binary. The people who are interested are going to start reading the people who aren't interested and are going to be like that's not for me. I want 75 clients, and I want to work 9 days a week, and I'm like, bye. And that's okay. So selling off the title is that the the thing that you have in both an imagery because you've got the you've got the opportunity to have an imagery in a book cover. both in terms of the imagery and the words used. You sell off the title. It is super clear what it is. It may not be like ultimately clear who it's for, necessarily. And they need some context for that. But it's super clear what it is, and they start to lean in.


## Binary Offers and the Importance of Explicitness

**Summary:**  Effective offers, especially for books, should be binary and explicit, clearly stating what they are and who they are for. This approach allows potential buyers to quickly self-select, leading to higher conversion rates and more qualified leads.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
And I want you to see the cover of your book and the lead as as an offer. Come here or go away right? So when when we're getting in there, all we're doing is unpacking the common questions they have. How does this work? When do I get it? What's the guarantee? etc? Right? And then they click in. So it works because it's binary and so lead with the stuff. A book is not the time to be cute about your pieces, or the mechanisms, or vague in terms of how you present it. It works because it's there, and then everything cascades from that, because then they're getting to this page right if you haven't got them. And the central idea on the 1st page in the bump, this page doesn't work. and then the downsell doesn't work either. And then the experience doesn't work at all right. So think about selling off the title and and ultimately making it binary.


## Book Funnel Ads: New Book Angle and For-Sale Ads

**Summary:**  Two effective ad strategies for book funnels are the "new book" angle, leveraging the inherent appeal of novelty, and simple for-sale ads that clearly state the product and target audience.  Combining these approaches can cater to a wider range of potential buyers.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So we're running currently 2 types of ads. There's there's a time based one. And these are converting it different ratios, because one's longer and one's just shorter and and more explicit. When you have a book out you can use the old thing of it's new, right? People like things that are new because they're better than things that are old in people's minds. So words like free words like new are great things that you can put into your marketing because they are naturally attractive to people. So I've always run new book ads. Candidly, even when the book. Isn't that new? I still run new book ads because it's new to them, right? Like, you know, I'm like trading an ethical line there. But it's new. It's new to somebody. They've never seen it before. So it's new I'm trying to justify.


## Ad Creative and Copy Variations: Feeding the Algorithm

**Summary:**  Modern advertising algorithms require a large volume of creative and copy variations.  Repurposing successful organic content can be an effective strategy for generating ad variations and feeding the algorithm's demand for fresh content.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So with algorithms and distribution these days, you know, the big thing is as creative and copy variations. I keep promising them. I'm going to write some bang along form. I haven't quite hasn't quite come to me yet, but it will come to me where I'll I'll write my I write another one of my disruption ads, or something that you we can probably run for a couple of years. You know. I've got it in me somewhere. It's just buried in the subconscious right now. But the the balance between, you know, a long form ad. and again use something that works organically. All my long form ads are variants of something that's worked organically on the platform that we put it on. So if you've had a great Facebook post, if you've had a great Linkedin post. If you've had something that's worked particularly well on Instagram that will work as an ad.


## Chris Benetti on Ad Simplicity and Avoiding Overcomplication

**Summary:**  Chris Benetti cautions against overcomplicating ads and funnels, advising to keep things simple and avoid getting bogged down in complex technical strategies.  Focus on getting the core message out and generating clients.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
I think there's opportunity to overcomplicate ads like a lot, and especially if you start this. Okay, this whole thing. Right? Oh, yeah, definitely, yes. I would just say, like, be wary of the gurus who are like technical ad people or technical funnel people, because they'll make you try to build a complicated system. And ultimately it's all gonna stop you from actually getting the shit out there and getting it done and getting clients from it. So you know, keep it simple is probably the biggest piece of feedback around ads that I've got.


## Book Funnels: DIY vs. Agency Management

**Summary:**  While DIY book funnel management is feasible up to a certain ad spend, scaling and optimizing for larger budgets often requires expert assistance.  Investing in agency support can be beneficial for maximizing long-term returns and avoiding the complexities of high-spend ad campaigns.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
Yeah, I before I move on to the client speed I really want you to take away today that a book isn't hard, right? What is hardest, scaling it. getting the economics right, feeding it with creative. And and those things I believe in terms of like. Candidly like, you can diy this up to a hundred, or, you know, maybe a little bit more a day in terms of ad spend and kind of find your feet and optimize it yourself past that, and to really turn it into a big asset. It's it's complicated because there's a lot of moving parts that you want to get right in the funnel, and there's a lot of moving parts that you get right in the ads.


## Converting Book Customers into Clients: Waitlists and Live Workshops

**Summary:**  Two effective strategies for converting book customers into clients are using waitlists, which automatically funnel customers into client programs, and hosting live workshops, which offer high conversion rates and opportunities for direct client pitches.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So the final, you know you've got your book. You've got your funnel. You've got some ads up, you know, and you've probably promoted organically as well. You've started talking about it, you know. The 1st 4 months of the sovereign consultant was just me talking about it, you know, and I sold 500 copies of the book just by signing up for the book. Right? The the key piece, you know, and the piece of both. The other piece of experimentation is around converting those those book customers into clients. So I've done 2 things, and I'm gonna double down on one of these things. and discard the other just through experimentation. So the 1st one is putting them on a wait list. And if you want the wait list again, it's in the waitlist training in in the classroom.


## Live Workshops: A High-Leverage Path to Client Acquisition

**Summary:**  Live workshops are a highly effective method for converting customers to clients. They provide valuable content, increase time on brand, and offer a natural opportunity to pitch client programs.  A converting live workshop can also become a standalone product, further increasing leverage.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
I'm going to double down on live workshops for 2 reasons. A live workshop is a better product than a static course. So I'm gonna change my $200 upsell into a a course and a program and bonuses. But it's around a live workshop. and a live workshop is a much higher converting path from customers to clients right? We know around here that you know, people can easily get 10 to 40% of people who come to a workshop into their community or client program. If I was starting from scratch I would sell a live workshop in the funnel and get people who buy the book into that into that live workshop and ultimately pitch the client program from there.


## Book Funnel Templates, the Sovereign Book Club, and Done-For-You Services

**Summary:** James Kemp offers funnel templates and announces the Sovereign Book Club, an 8-week program to help participants create, market, and launch their own book funnels.  A done-for-you service is also available for those who prefer to outsource the process.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**
So 2 things left. We've got some swipes. Chris has put together way more than I asked him to. He's massively over delivered. We've got creative swipes. We got the copy swipes. and we've got the funnel template. This is the I'm not sure if you can see that this is the live book funnel that we're running on software consultant. So as you can see, it's done. 40 ish brand on the front end. This is the exact funnel that I've given you. So I've given you everything in this one. So it's got the sales page, the upsell, the downsell, the confirmation, and then we've included the wait list, and then we've included the delivery components of the of the different of the different upsells and downsells, so you can drop your upsell and downsell, and that delivery.

## Book Funnels: A Powerful Tool for Profit

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the power of book funnels, highlighting their potential for generating significant profit with minimal effort once established, despite initial challenges. He emphasizes the importance of persistence and the interconnectedness of various marketing platforms in driving conversions.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:** Book funnels are great once they're running. They have a voracious appetite for time and money. I don't have a link for the book club yet. If you want to do it, I've got nothing set up yet to even get it going. But I know what we're doing. I'll set it up today.  Gonna have some banging book funnels. I'm either the smartest man in the world or the luckiest man in the world, but all my book funnels have crashed pretty much from the first week. Once you get them going, they just roll. I remember a few weeks ago we had a $1,000 day through the book funnel. It happened to be a weekend, I think, and I remember that feeling of like, I just spent 350 bucks and made a thousand bucks, and I did absolutely nothing. And then it's like, spend more money. And you're still not spending enough money. So they're a beautiful funnel. I regret turning anything that I've turned off before, so I pay for ads handsomely to make sure that I don't just get bored and give up on this one because it's a beautiful little monster.  Everything nowadays is interconnected. I've seen easier and better results through the book funnel over the last few weeks, as I've started creating more content across more platforms and had wider distribution of just simple posts. So nowadays, my rhythm is the daily email and a video. And the video goes everywhere. The interconnected and algorithmic world means that ads are a super powerful thing, and they'll find the people. But the more they know you, like you, trust you, and the more the algorithm hooks into what they're consuming, the more it starts to recommend in these places. And I'm seeing people find me on YouTube, buy a book like the next day.


## The Interconnected Algorithmic World and Book Funnels

**Summary:**  James describes how the interconnected nature of online platforms, driven by algorithms, contributes to the effectiveness of book funnels in converting prospects into clients. He shares an example of a recent client who discovered him on YouTube, bought his book, and subsequently joined his program, demonstrating the rapid conversion potential.

**Video Source:** Book Funnel Workshop.txt

**Content:**  People are responding in an email for the waitlist or application from the syndicate. The chap who joined this morning was exactly that. He literally discovered me on YouTube. The algorithm, the Meta algorithm, clocked that he'd watched a YouTube video of me. Then the book funnel was put in front of him, and then he buys the book. And then, he's coming through my daily emails to talk about the syndicate and then joining in the course of a few days. So we are in an interconnected and algorithmic world. The book funnel is a very, very high conversion epicenter of that. But once you get all these things around there, then it starts converting. There's different opportunities. Algorithms are almost scary in the way that they find people and put these assets in front of them. And this is the way to ultimately convert customers into clients. Okay, peeps, I'll get those links checked and we'll upload the training and make sure you got the templates as well today.


## Bundling and Unbundling 101: Introduction to the Value Equation

**Summary:** James Kemp introduces the concept of bundling and unbundling, explaining how understanding the individual value equations of prospects is crucial for creating multiple offers and increasing sales. He emphasizes that each prospect perceives value differently based on their current situation and desired rate of return.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** Bundling and unbundling 101. Today I'm going to give you the goggles to look at the value creator and the value equation and talk about what you can unpack in your current business to create more sales, because in many cases you are creating more assets than you think you are. And if you're not creating assets, then this is a way to look at your creation as asset creation. If you're a guest, I'm opening up the syndicate today. Have a look, if that's for you. Great, if it's not, that's great, too.  This is a 101. I just want to give you today, putting the goggles on to look at the value equation. There's lots of terms thrown around that represent value. When you go to the market, you'll hear different things, and people judge price as a value indicator, but it's just one of the value indicators. So if you ever hear "it's too expensive" or "I can't afford it right now," they are seen as objections. They're actually representations of the value equation that somebody is undertaking in their head. The interesting thing about the space we're in is that there hasn't been much commentary on the value equation, because every single prospect in your audience has a different value equation. They see value based on their current position. Every single person has a value equation in their head which is relative to the things they're doing right now. So they see value based on what they're doing, how quickly they can see a return on the next thing that they do, the next investment they make, and the volume and the speed of that. So if your offer or your products that you're putting out in the market, if you want people to perceive them as valuable immediately, then you increase the rate of return, which is, they get more faster by working with you. So when we're communicating, when we're putting messaging out into the market, we have content and communication that seeks to align them with the value equation.


## Multiple Offers, Multiple Value Equations: The Math of Bundling and Unbundling

**Summary:** James explains how having multiple offers allows businesses to cater to different value equations within the market, exponentially increasing sales. He stresses the importance of achieving this without adding complexity to the business, which can hinder growth and scalability.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:**  "I can get you more customers. I can help you lose weight. This is the way I do it," etc. You are trying to communicate that there is value in the thing you do. So if you have one offer, you need a large volume of content to align the highest number of people to a singular value equation. Because if you have a singular offer, you have a singular value equation. It has a linear relationship. Within the syndicate, I show you how to get to a million-dollar-a-year profit business. The value equation of that is going to differ if someone is making $10,000 a year right now versus someone who's making $900,000, because the gap is larger and the perceived time on return is very, very different. So if you have multiple products and offers, then you tip the value equation towards you exponentially. So rather than having a singular offer, if we have multiple offers, then we can essentially have multiple value equations in the marketplace. And by maths, we increase the number of sales we make. So this is the central idea of bundling and unbundling. The more offers we make, the more sales we make. But the subtext is, the more offers we make, the more that we hit the value equation for a larger group of people in the market, because they all perceive what they want, need, and will get in different ways. The key is to do this without adding complexity, and that is honestly where most people fall over. They add complexity to it because they try and meet the market where they perceive the market is, rather than bundling and unbundling and repackaging things to change the value equation. Bundling and unbundling is a way to increase the number of offers we make and increase the value equation in the market without adding complexity.


## Leverage and Assets: Building a Business That Feeds Your Life

**Summary:** James emphasizes the importance of leverage in building a sustainable business, advocating for viewing all creations as assets. He differentiates between a product (a vehicle for delivering value) and an offer (products presented to the market with a promise), highlighting how multiple offers maximize economics and leverage.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** The central concept of anything we do is we build businesses that feed our life. This means that leverage is our highest priority. To get the most amount of leverage, it's useful to see everything we create as an asset. If you want to get rich, you either build, borrow, buy, or steal assets and own them and derive a yield from them. The wonderful thing about the space that we live in is that we can create assets very, very quickly, with little to no overhead, just using the things that reside inside our brain. I make this distinction a lot: the distinction between a product and offer. A product is just a vehicle for delivering value. An offer is one or more products presented to the market. The offer is the thing that we wrap around the product to convey and communicate the value that that product might deliver to someone. An offer has a promise, whereas a product has a function. In the course of delivering and creating, we create multiple products that we can create offers around and serve us as assets. The more offers we have, the more maximal our economics are. If we want leverage, then we have to have maximal economics. Maximal economics is the highest practical number of offers and the highest potential conversion across our audience. In the sovereign way, this is how we desire to have a small audience, but we have converted a large portion of those people into customers and clients, and we do that through offers.


## The Client Workshop Flywheel: Unbundling for Asset Creation

**Summary:** James explains how client workshops can be unbundled and leveraged as a product, creating a positive flywheel for customer acquisition and client development.  He describes how more clients lead to more opportunities for creation, further fueling the flywheel.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** The first level of unbundling is this workshop. Right now, I am unbundling. If you are delivering to your clients with frequency, then you are creating products with frequency. By selling tickets to client workshops, you are unbundling a feature of your bundled product. The flywheel is: I create a workshop for clients, and I've created a product. I sell tickets to the workshop, and when I sell a ticket, I've created a customer. I invite those customers to become clients, and then I've created a client. And then I create workshops for those people, and I can go round and round that flywheel for as long as I need to. The flywheel is a positive flywheel because the more clients you have, the more you can afford to deliver, which means the more variables that you have in your client base, the more that you can create for your client base. When you have a few clients, it's more difficult to have a high level of creation because creation has to come from somewhere. You guys inspire me to create more stuff because you go out in the world and you come across speed bumps or problems or opportunities, and then you bring them back. We diagnose them, and then we look at ways to get around them, get over them, or harness them. So the more clients you have, the easier it is to be on a cycle of creation because people are bringing problems and opportunities into your world that you can then solve for by creating trainings, resources, cheat sheets, whatever it is to get them around that.


##  Every Product an Asset: Maximizing Yield and Distribution

**Summary:** James highlights how every product created, including workshop recordings, can be treated as an asset with multiple yield opportunities. He points out that many businesses underutilize their existing assets and encourages strategic distribution to maximize their value.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** When you have that positive flywheel, you are on an asset creation cycle, because every single product you create largely becomes an asset. The recording of this workshop is an asset. I've got many, many ways I could yield that. I could chop it up and break it into multiple products. I could sell it as a singular product. I could rent it to somebody else via a licensing agreement.  So once I've created something, I am looking for ways to turn it into one or more assets and having that on a positive flywheel. We can extend that idea to every product inside our world. In my experience, it's the same with creating lead magnets. Most people are sitting on a ton of assets that they're not distributing or yielding. You're sitting on such a high volume of training, material, and resources that you don't know which one to put out. The equation simply says, well, what does the market bear and understand? The variable returns I get from all the different assets are vast. There are singular $100 workshops that have yielded over six figures for me, and there are ones that have barely registered on the scoreboard. The time investment was the same, but the output and the value equation in the marketplace was perceived as different.


## Bundling Basics: Creating Clear Value Propositions and Transformations

**Summary:** James explains that bundling, the traditional approach in coaching and consulting, involves combining multiple products into a single offer with a clear outcome and preferential pricing. He outlines the three key components of a bundled offer: content/training, community, and customization.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** Traditionally, every coaching and consulting business is bundled, and when you look under the hood, there are a number of products inside that can be unbundled. Bundling is very, very simple because it's the thing that people do and have done for a long time. If you come to a syndicate call and I ask you what your offer is, the thing that you will present me will be a bundled offer. By bundling our products together and creating an offer with an outcome, we can have a clear value proposition: if you buy this, you will get this. If you are seeking to install any kind of transformation in someone, then we bundle together the three requirements: content (training, material), community (where we bring people together to collaborate), and customization (group calls, one-on-one calls, messaging, access to coaches). A bundle will always have preferential pricing over individual parts. So when we bundle something together, it is at a pricing level lower than the individual components would be priced at separately. Bundling is efficient and allows a prospect to see potential transformation much more clearly. The sum of the parts is available at a lower price point than buying them individually.


## Bundled Offers: Easier to Create, Harder to Sell

**Summary:** While bundled offers are generally easier to create, they can be more challenging to sell due to the need to align prospects with a specific value equation. James emphasizes the importance of identifying the individual components of an offer to understand and communicate its value effectively.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** Bundled offers are, in some ways, easier to create and harder to sell because you have to align people with the value equation. The value equation being the current perceived value of the desire they had. What value does someone see in me mentoring them to get to a million dollars a year? That variable is going to be vast in terms of how much they'll invest, how long they will invest, how quickly they will decide to do it, etc. To have any kind of bundling and unbundling pathway, we need to come back to the central idea, which is the value equation. To see the value equation, firstly, we must see the individual parts of our delivery. What are the components of your current offers? How do we put the goggles on and actually see them as individual products or parts? And then what do we do with them? We can only communicate the value in something after we actually identify that it's valuable in the first place. Unbundling 101 is identifying that particular things inside your world probably have an outsized value over and above other things. And then, if we can see those things, we can define their value and make offers around them.


## Unbundling the Syndicate: Creating Multiple Value Equations

**Summary:** James uses his own Syndicate program as an example of how to unbundle a bundled offer. By assigning individual values to the training portal, community, and group calls, he can create separate offers catering to different value equations and market segments.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** This is a simple exercise that I did on my stuff. I have the syndicate. The syndicate is made up of three products: a training portal, a community, and group calls. I bundle them together and call it the Syndicate, which has a proposition around it that people buy into for $250 a week. If I put values on those individual components, I could value the training at $100 a week, the community at $100 a week, and the group calls at $150. I could go to the marketplace and say, "Hey, it's $250 to get into the syndicate, and we have training, community, and calls." And then a portion of the marketplace would see the value in that. Another portion of the marketplace would be like, "I don't really need calls. All I need is access to the trainings." And then, if I chose to do that, I could sign someone up and say, "Okay, for $100 a week, you can have just access to the trainings. But you don't get the other things," because their value equation is different. They don't see value in the calls. Their current value equation is, if I get access to the training, then that's what I see the highest rate of return for me relative to my investment.


## Unbundling for Creativity and Market Segmentation

**Summary:** James explains how unbundling allows for creative offer creation and taps into different market segments by allowing prospects to choose the components they value most. He highlights how this approach can lead to clients eventually bundling the components themselves as they recognize the value of the other parts.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** By unbundling and looking at those as individual components, we can essentially productize every part of what we're doing and what we have. These things, when you go to the marketplace, will also surprise you at where value is perceived. Access tends to be the highest kind of priority value. If people want transformation, they tend to lean towards, "Can I have one-on-one calls? Can I have access?" By giving them access to that, I could sell access to the Syndicate weekly calls for $150 a week, because they would perceive that if they come to those calls, then they would get a higher rate of return based on what they're doing. But in the course of that, they might realize that having access to the community is super valuable as well, and then they add on the access to the community and the training, for example, and they eventually end up bundling those things themselves. So bundling and unbundling allows a lot of creativity, but it also allows you to tap into bits of the market that perceive value in different ways.


## The Circle: An Assemblage of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Offers

**Summary:** James describes his "Circle" offer as an assemblage of various unbundled products, allowing clients to choose their own adventure and customize their value equation. He explains how this approach encourages clients to buy multiple products by highlighting the value of each individual component.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** Essentially, what I do with the Circle is just put everything in there as the simplest way of doing it. In the Circle, there's a dedicated group call, there's one-on-one access, there's WhatsApp, and the Circle includes the Bali Blueprint. I also sell all of those things individually, apart from the Circle group call.  What you have is essentially an assemblage of the choose-your-own-adventure where people can essentially set their own value equation. One of the reasons why a huge proportion of people who come into my world buy something else is because I've made it easy to buy something else, because I've highlighted the value on a particular product. One of the reasons that a huge amount of people who are on my email list have bought products is because I unbundle those products and make them very easy and accessible to buy.  It's really important that we have a map first, because a map and actually being able to see these things allows us to test and experiment with the market about what they perceive value at.


##  Experimentation and Speed: Adapting to the Evolving Marketplace

**Summary:** James discusses the increasing importance of experimentation and speed in the market, particularly in the AI space, where prototypes and real-time product interaction are becoming the norm. He advocates for a product/asset-driven approach, emphasizing that people are more likely to buy products than marketing.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** The experimentation and speed has become ever more important. I'm talking to people in the AI space right now, and they have gone from having to do mock-ups and theoretical designs to building prototypes in front of people in real time and playing with the product in real time. The market is moving towards that where people expect things to almost function to a full extent right in front of them. This means that we must adapt to that marketplace where people will buy products over marketing. So having a lens on our business and our creation as a product or asset-driven business allows us to use those assets and put those things in front of people very, very quickly. It's also much more efficient if we use things that are already created rather than creating marketing. The AI space is fascinating in terms of the speed of which the sale can be made now because people are moving through the theoretical ("This product might work for you this way") straight to "Here is the product. Let's customize it and make it better for you."


##  Minimizing Risk and Maximizing Opportunity Through Experimentation

**Summary:** James encourages experimentation with unbundling, emphasizing the minimal downside and significant potential for uncovering hidden value and understanding market preferences. He suggests offering smaller, targeted bundles to test market response and validate the value equation of different components.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:**  When we look at the market dynamics, all of these things flow into every marketplace, and people get used to trying before buying, test driving things, etc. So having some flexibility and some creativity about how people can access our products and experimenting with those opens up opportunities that are not available to us. When you examine the downside and the risk and the costs of them, they're very, very small. What would be the downside of me selling group calls to five people? "Hey, come to the group Syndicate group calls for the next 13 weeks without access to the other things for 150 bucks." I would quickly convert those five people, and I would quickly validate whether that is good or bad for me, and good or bad for them. But it's only through the doing that those things are validated in terms of where people see value, what they'll buy into, and ultimately, what behavior that they lead to next.


## Concurrent Campaigns: Maximizing Market Economics and Utility

**Summary:** James explains how bundling and unbundling allows for running concurrent campaigns, targeting both external and internal markets with different offers. He prioritizes internal offers for existing community members, providing them with preferential pricing and access to exclusive opportunities.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** Bundling and unbundling allows us to have multiple offers at once.  I can have two concurrent campaigns running at once, so I can be on the outside selling one thing and on the inside selling another thing. You notice over the past few weeks I've opened up various opportunities. I opened up the Circle to people who are in the Syndicate first before I went to the marketplace. I opened up the Blueprint dates to people who are in the Syndicate first before I went to the marketplace. I will, at the moment, exclusively sell one-on-one hours to people who are in the community, rather than selling them to people on my list because there's a higher value proposition and a higher rate of return. I can also discount those things safely in a closed environment. I don't want to go above the line and discount my hours to people who don't know me and don't have a perceived value of that, because all they see is the discount.


## Maintaining Price Integrity and Maximizing Internal Demand

**Summary:** James discusses the strategy of offering discounted pricing to existing community members while maintaining a higher market rate for external clients. This approach allows for maximizing internal demand and prevents sending signals to the market that could devalue his premium offerings.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** While my outside market rate is still $5,000, I reduce that significantly for people who are already in that world. This allows me to bundle and unbundle, but also safely price something. I'm not sending a signal to the market. If you are discounting things on a regular basis, then you can be sending signals to the market where ultimately that becomes your fixed daily rate, and I still have people paying $5,000. So I want to make sure that I can maintain the integrity of that. A cycle that I'm going through now is the Syndicate, opening up the Circle, the Blueprint, and then selling the workshops internally. Then I'm going through a different promotion cycle where I've opened up one-on-one hours, opened up the Blueprint for the dates, and ensured that people who are already in the Syndicate or in the community can have a pay plan on the Blueprint. I've got three VIPs booked, and I'll offer those internally first. By taking these goggles, I can have two different things for sale at once, which maximizes the market and economics, but also maximizes the utility. People have been reaching out to me saying, "When are you going to open hours?" So there was already demand there internally that I could tap.


## Minimizing Complexity for Scalability and Growth

**Summary:** James emphasizes the importance of minimizing complexity in business for scalability and growth. He explains that too much variation in delivery creates complexity, making it difficult to scale and hindering the development of a solid value proposition.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** We're looking at reducing complexity. All of the things that I am showing you are things that I'm doing and things that I can scale. I'm prepared to do a segment of hours every few months. Is it maximally scalable? No, it's not, because I limit the number of one-on-one hours that I have available. The minimizing complexity piece is the piece where most people fall over with this because they start creating rather than unbundling. The more variation we have in delivery, the more complexity we have. If you are doing a lot of different things for different clients at different price points, then you have high complexity. It doesn't matter what your business model is, if you have a lot of variability in delivery, you have a complex business, and complex businesses are hard to scale. They're hard to grow because it's actually more mental because you don't know what you're offering at any price point. You don't have a solid value proposition. So the more variables you have in your client base, the more complex the business is. If you are doing a small number of things routinely, then you'll have lower complexity.


##  Scalability and the Standalone Product Test

**Summary:** James explains that the test of a scalable product is whether it can stand on its own and generate significant revenue independently. He uses his own products (one-on-one hours, Blueprint, Circle) as examples of scalable offerings that can each generate six-figure or multiple six-figure incomes.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** The test is in each individual product. If it can stand on its own and scale. For me, the test is, are these individual products a business on their own right? Could I make six or multiple six figures a year out of selling one-on-one hours? Yes. Could I make six or multiple six figures out of selling the Blueprint, by doing the VIP, by just doing the Circle? The answer is yes. So therefore, those things all scale. They scale on the practical level is that I can do them repeatedly, and they scale on the emotional level, as I'm prepared to do them repeatedly. While I'll go through seasons where I'm definitely keen to do one-on-one hours more than I am at other times, they will always be a presence in the business. So by plotting the map of what we actually have, we have a lot of flexibility. The products are much more dynamic. And then it's up to us: what can we experiment with? What can we go to market with where people will see a value equation that they haven't seen before?


##  The Value of a Product Map and Addressing Weaknesses

**Summary:** James emphasizes the importance of having a product map to understand the lay of the land in terms of assets and identify weaknesses in production and scalability. He advises pricing products that don't scale accordingly to avoid over-delivering on offerings that demand significant time and energy.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** Plenty of people won't see a value equation in the Syndicate. Plenty of people won't see a full value equation in the Circle. I've had conversations with a couple of you, and we decided that the Syndicate was the best place for you right now because you were getting the right level of access to community, the right level of access to me and help. So going up and making the commitment to tripling your investment on a weekly basis doesn't make sense, but that doesn't preclude you from periodically buying hours and access. Having a map and having a view of what a product, what an asset is, and ultimately what an offer is, allows us to look at the lay of the land in terms of our assets and the things that we produce, but it also highlights our weaknesses. Are we producing enough in terms of creating assets? It also highlights the weaknesses: are there things that we are doing that we don't actually want to scale and tolerate? Because if those things are present, then we won't actually scale them. A number of people, especially in the health and personal development categories, were looking to remove some of the custom elements of their programs because they understood that those things didn't scale. So productizing those pieces, while they're attractive to the market, also, they only have limited scale, so they must be priced accordingly.


##  Content-Only Offers and Market Experimentation

**Summary:** James discusses the potential of content-only offers as a way to experiment with the market and understand buyer behavior. He considers offering access to all his trainings on a recurring basis without any additional components to see how this impacts buyer cohorts and potential upsells.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** The map is really important to understand those things and then experiment. I will go to the market over the coming months with a content-only offer where it's just, "Yeah, have access to all my trainings on a recurring basis," and with nothing else there. What will that do? I don't know. Will it create a whole cohort of buyers? Yes, it will. What will those buyers do? We will see. What behaviors do they undertake? Do people buy my trainings, and then do a portion of those people then buy one-on-one hours over the top, so they skip out the group components? Possibly. Maybe that's happening at the moment where people are essentially bundling together on their own by buying access to some of my content, but also buying one-on-one hours with me, and kind of skipping over the group component that we have in the Syndicate. For them, that value equation is the most efficient at the relative price point.


## Unbundling for Client Empowerment and Flexibility

**Summary:** James explains how unbundling empowers clients to access the value they see fit, allowing them to assemble their own customized packages. He emphasizes the importance of offering scalable products and being open to how clients choose to combine them, recognizing that different combinations will appeal to different individuals.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** Unbundling allows our audience and our clients and our customers to essentially access the value that they see fit, and as long as we are prepared to do it and prepared to offer it because it's scalable to us, then they can assemble that for us with low complexity. I don't have a preference for what 90% of people buy off me until I do have a preference in terms of, I can help advise them what's the best path to go in. So that means that by unbundling, I allow people to choose their own adventure and essentially assemble things that I can't see. A training plus a one-on-one component would be highly valuable to one person, but highly risky for someone else because they wouldn't be able to extract the value fast enough relative to where they are. So it comes back to us being able to unbundle, and our clients being able to see the value equation and tip it in their favor.


## Addressing Client Objections and Diagnosing Value Equations

**Summary:** James discusses how to handle client objections related to price by diagnosing their individual value equations. He emphasizes asking clients what they're trying to achieve rather than directly addressing their price concerns, as this provides valuable context for understanding their needs.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:**  As with any kind of sales conversation, you're kind of diagnosing their own value equation. So what do they say? What do they perceive value in? I've purposely avoided upselling and downselling because it's part of a sales process, whereas this is part of a productization process. What you're looking for is them to put the truth on the table as to where they perceive value. And then you've got the option to present how you would deliver against that value. I'll give you two real examples. When I launched the Circle, I said to two people, "You don't need it." One person said, "I want this bit of it, but I don't see value in the other thing, so I don't want to do it." And so I made an offer where they'd have access to the community and the trainings, and one-on-one access to me via WhatsApp at a price that's higher than the Circle, which actually includes that component. And they perceived more value in that because they don't want to be involved in group stuff. They want training, and they want to be able to message me.  At a practical level, I don't seek to apply a solution. I don't say, "What do you see value in?" etc. I ask them what they're trying to do. Because that doesn't mean anything without context. "Too expensive" for what? You don't know what that means until you ask them and understand what the context means. We should be rigid in our boundaries and flexible in our packaging of those boundaries.


## Ashley's Unbundling Ideas: Nutrition-Only Offer and Executive Consulting

**Summary:** Ashley Richmond proposes two unbundling ideas: a nutrition-only offer for clients already working with trainers and a higher-priced consulting offer for executives who prefer individualized guidance. James cautions against adding complexity and encourages leveraging existing components.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** I think with my offer, offering something like just nutrition would probably go well, cause a lot of people are working with an in-person trainer, so they don't need fitness, but they do need nutrition.  I also think there's room for the people who want less stuff and are willing to pay more. A lot of executives don't want the group aspect at all. They just want me to tell them what to do. So I think there's room for some sort of consulting offer where they get messaging, a roadmap for them.  With nutrition, it's a lot of ongoing support. I think that ongoing support would be helpful in a group. So I'd probably start with an audit, make a plan going forward, and maybe weekly check-ins without trying to make it too complicated. Having a chat, whether it was a group or a one-on-one chat, would be helpful. I already have a WhatsApp group, so I could just make an extra channel for them. If you're adding a component, then you're potentially adding complexity. Anything that's even a small amount of complexity in a leverage business can add up to a large amount of complexity, because leverage works always. Leverage works for us, but it also works against us.


##  Unbundling by Frame: Removing the Fitness Component

**Summary:** Ashley and James discuss unbundling her existing program by removing the fitness component for clients who already have trainers. James points out that this is unbundling by frame, as the underlying components remain the same, and suggests a pricing strategy based on this reframing.

**Video Source:** Bundling and unbundling.txt

**Content:** At your $100 level, they get training and group messaging, basically.  I'd be taking out the fitness side, and then probably the rest would stay the same. So they get the modules, which would have fitness stuff in there anyway, and then the group channel as well

## Leveraging Group Dynamics for Client Acquisition

**Summary:**  James Kemp emphasizes the benefits of incorporating a group element into coaching programs, even in the initial stages. This fosters a sense of community and makes it easier to expand the program by attracting new clients to an established, thriving group.

**Video Source:** source: Cash.txt

**Content:** Having a group element, even if it's just the first iteration, is hugely beneficial. It becomes a thing, and if it's a thing you love, and it's lucrative, then we're much more likely to sell into a thing once we've got it rolling. Because if I've got 4 people doing this, then why not 5? So you're more likely to grow it and make an offer around it.


## Discernment and Setting Limits in Client Work

**Summary:** James Kemp advises coaches to exercise discernment and set limits on their time and availability.  While one-on-one coaching is valuable, it can lead to burnout if not managed carefully with boundaries and realistic client capacity.

**Video Source:** source: Cash.txt

**Content:** The thing I'll leave you with is discernment. One-on-one and these components are selling time. They are highly valuable and they have a high return. But things that have a high return also have a high cost. The things that have burnt me out the fastest? Lots of time at Zoom, lots of one-on-one, lots of events, lots of availability, and little boundaries. So it does require discernment to deploy these things and place limits on them. We talk limits a lot about just the practical elements of scarcity and deadlines, both to stimulate the market and get a decision, but also to mitigate delivery issues. It's great to sign 15 clients at once, but if you can't onboard all 15 clients in a reasonable amount of time, you're not going to have 15 clients for very long. So use discernment. Go under the limits that you think you can have capacity for. You think you can take 5 one-on-one clients? You think you can do 10 a week? My recommendation is, halve it, because that's the reality of what you can deploy adequately. Sure, if times are tough and you need some cash flow, then maybe you do need to sell every hour that God gave you to get back on track. There is a time and a place for those things, for doing things we've all done things that maybe didn't necessarily want to do to stay in the game.


## The Power of Simplicity and Sustainable Growth

**Summary:** James Kemp highlights the importance of simple, yet powerful strategies for client acquisition and retention.  He stresses sustainable growth within one's capacity, avoiding overextension that could hinder future progress.

**Video Source:** source: Cash.txt

**Content:** Use discernment when you're deploying these things, then their power is in their simplicity. But their power is also that they're putting you in a place to move forward rather than maybe limit the next step that you can make as well.


## Event Follow-up and Content Distribution

**Summary:** James Kemp addresses inquiries about an event, prioritizing existing syndicate members. He also discusses plans for distributing the recording, promising to edit out unnecessary parts before sharing it with the syndicate.

**Video Source:** source: Cash.txt

**Content:** A couple of people messaged me about the event privately. I give syndicate folks first dibs on those. I only put the date up yesterday, so I'll release those probably in a week or so, more publicly, after I've got some more folks in the syndicate. Thank you very much. We'll get the recording out later. We'll edit the bullshit at the beginning and the rambling at the end, and we'll get it out to you. Our syndicate people will be in the piece, and I guess I'll be in the, we'll host it on the page, but we'll drop you an email when it's ready.


## Content Creation for Meaningful Conversations

**Summary:** James Kemp introduces his approach to content creation, emphasizing its role in sparking conversations that lead to sales. He defines content broadly as any creation designed to communicate a message, prioritizing communication skills over platform-specific strategies.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** So welcome, squad, welcome to our guests as well. If this is your first time, welcome. We've got a Google Doc, it will be, I just had 10 other people join since then, so it will be in the shared with the replay both inside the classroom and also, I guess you'll get a copy of the replay and resources. So, content. To set the scene, I'm going to talk about content in general terms. I get specific in terms of platforms and these different, even mediums. But when I talk about content, I'm talking about the creation of something to convey, to communicate and convey a message. So when I talk about content, you'll understand that philosophy as I go along. I'm not starting from the point of, this is content for Facebook, this is content for email, this is content for YouTube, or whatever. The origin point of content is communication, and knowing how to communicate and what to communicate is the 80/20 factor. So when I talk about content, I talk about it in the macro, and obviously the examples I show you through this are in the micro. They live out in the world, whether it's email or Facebook or Instagram or other places. Content makes money, and content is the most democratized form of leverage that there is. You do not need money to create content. For many other forms of leverage in the world, you need existing resources to actually have any kind of advantage in deploying leverage. Content is not like that. It is fully democratized. The flip side of that is, it's fully competitive. The demands on our attention have never been greater, because there's never been more content. And to be clear, I create content to create conversations. I make money from conversations. I don't make money from making an offer. I make money from understanding what somebody wants and having a solution to that, and then delivering on that solution. But I've made friends, connected with people, made millions of dollars from content. But unless I see something back from it, unless I see over the long term, I wouldn't be participating in making content. And just to, in terms of, to understand that, I write for myself more than I write for other people to communicate. So I have millions more words in different places that are writing to me, which is my thinking that I don't communicate with other people. I just communicate with other people to generate conversations so I can be useful to them.


## The Importance of Practice and Distilling Success Factors

**Summary:** James Kemp acknowledges the difficulty of teaching content creation due to his own unconscious competence. He emphasizes the importance of practice and aims to distill his success factors into actionable steps for his audience.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** I will admit something: this is very difficult for me to teach because I've been doing it for so long. I understand how much unconscious competence I have in writing and communicating. And so a lot of the things that come through just come through. So I have to work really hard to break these down into something that's actually digestible for you, and actionable as well, because so much of my ability to communicate is just purely reps and practice. But these are the, this is the distillation of that, so you can replicate those. And then at the end, I'm going to give you the ability to actually replicate those.


##  Creating Content that Delivers Insight

**Summary:** James Kemp stresses the importance of delivering insight rather than just information.  He explains that insight provides the "why" behind the "what," demonstrating a deeper understanding that attracts clients seeking replicable success.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** We have to embrace some factors. These are the things that differentiate just noise and information in a marketplace from actual content that derives context to move someone forward. We're talking about content that does something, not just words on a screen and something to kill time. We want to move something in somebody, and we've got to do that through different factors. The first one is, we've got to deliver insight, because information is everywhere, but actually delivering insight is relatively rare. The distinction between those is, information allows us to observe what is happening, while insight gives us some kind of reasons why; it tells us why. So if you can demonstrate insight, you are demonstrating understanding of why something is happening via content. And then you are demonstrating a deeper understanding that others seek. It's all very well to tell somebody about something happening, or this client got this result. It's another level to deliver an insight about how that result happened and why it happened for this person, so those conditions can be replicated, and that gives the ability for you to work with somebody. Because if success is present, then you give an insight about why that success happened, and then that insight's delivered and they say, "Hey, maybe that works for me." The selling of ideas is what content does. Content doesn't sell offers, because before someone can buy something, they need to buy into something.


## Content as an Idea Salesperson

**Summary:**  James Kemp positions content as an "idea salesperson," emphasizing that selling ideas leads to easier product sales.  He advocates for selling the concept before the product, avoiding constant selling that can create audience fatigue.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** And that something is an idea. So if you sell people on your ideas, it's much easier to sell them on you, on working with you, and sell them on your products. If they are sold on the idea by the time you get to an offer or a product, then it's much more natural for them to buy that because it's a resolution of ideas and insights that have been delivered via content. So I approach content as an idea salesperson. As you know, I don't do sales calls. I don't do selling on a large degree. I just sell ideas and then allow people to buy into them. And then I have products that allow people to fulfill on those ideas. So I approach content as an idea salesperson, and doing that sells a hell of a lot more product, and also in a much more frictionless way than approaching content to sell a product. You'll see this when someone is constantly selling in their content, that it generates fatigue. But if you're constantly selling ideas, it generates insight and much more desire for the products you have on the other side of it.


## Living a Great Life for Great Content

**Summary:** James Kemp asserts that interesting content stems from an interesting life. He encourages documenting experiences and applying the principles he teaches to create compelling content that resonates with the audience.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** Here's a reality, and I'm going to give you a few realities in the creation of content: If your life is boring, your content is boring. If you don't do anything, then you have nothing to talk about. You just have nothing really to say that's of any interest. And to deliver insight, if you don't do anything, there is nothing to say, because content is an amplification of your own life and the characters in it. The simplest way to have great content is to live a great life. You do not need lots of hooks and angles and constantly coming up with ideas. If you just live a good life, and you be and do and document that along the way, and if you layer over what I'm going to show you today, then those things are a powerful driver for being interesting, to get people interested. And then actually sell the ideas through the telling of those stories and the documentation of that life.


##  Avoiding Authority-Destroying Content Practices

**Summary:** James Kemp outlines three content practices that erode authority: criticizing others, asking the audience what they want, and publicly complaining about private matters. He advises against these to maintain credibility.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** You will see a lot of different approaches to how people communicate and content, and you will see all these things show up, and I believe, and I have assessed them as destructive. It can take a long time to build authority, but it can be very, very quick to destroy. So you will destroy authority if you consistently, or even sometimes randomly, criticize others, specifically or directly. You will also destroy authority if you ask your audience what they want to see, what kind of content they want you to create, etc., because leaders don't ask what content and what people need, they just lead them. And you will also destroy authority subtly if you, there's a common thing in people's content where they criticize DMs they got, or they criticize cold outreach, or they criticize things that are happening to them, and they complain about it in public, and they take private things into public, which erodes authority. So if you criticize others directly, if you ask your audience, or if you complain excessively about different DMs, different trends – and I think a lot of people have one-shot their whole audience by an election that happened last year – you destroy your authority and credibility in the eyes of your audience, because people want to see something from you, and it's not complaining, and it's generally not negative.


## The Myth of the "Best" Content Platform

**Summary:** James Kemp debunks the idea of a single "best" platform for content, arguing that trust and attention can be built anywhere. He recommends creating content for one platform and then distributing it to others, prioritizing consistent creation over platform choice.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** One of the worst ideas that has proliferated is that there is a "best" platform. There is no such thing as a best platform to publish content on. This stops more people than it starts because it causes people to scatter focus. And there's some very convincing people out there who will market their version of content creation. They will say that LinkedIn is the best platform, some will say that YouTube is the best platform, someone else will say… right? All those people have an incentive to say that because they're selling that. But the reality is trust and attention can be built anywhere. Social networks have humans on them. Right now in my client group, I can point to people who are crushing it on different platforms in different ways with different content. But they've all got the same theme, which comes through in what you're going to see today. There is a formula that works for all this stuff that will continue to work, which is, create for one platform and then distribute it to other platforms. My whole content strategy is copy-paste, but it starts from the creation. The best platform for you is one that you can create consistently on.


## Choosing the Right Content Platform for Consistent Creation

**Summary:** James Kemp advises choosing a content platform based on individual strengths and the ability to create consistently.  He suggests text-based platforms for writers and video platforms for charismatic communicators, emphasizing consistent messaging over platform selection.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** It is very easy for me to wake up every day and write one or two emails. What is easy for you may differ. That could be one or two videos, that could be one or two tweets, that could be one or two Instagram pictures, reels, or anything in between. The best platform is the one that you can create consistently on, or you have created consistently on. And this requires some discernment. If you're a writer and you have a face for radio, then Facebook and LinkedIn, which are text-based platforms, would easily fit into your wheelhouse. If you're great on video and you're charismatic and you're a great communicator, then Instagram or YouTube, and copy and paste those same ideas to Facebook and LinkedIn. But you're creating for a primary platform. Your message and the consistency of sharing it matter far more than choosing the right platform. My primary channel is email, then I distribute content across multiple platforms. If I record something on video, which is like another content medium, it's based off something I've already written, and that's in almost all cases. The idea is seeded in writing, and then the video is created because I can create in another medium. So I take a create-first stance because the message is the most important thing, and distribute second.


##  A Copy-Paste Content Strategy

**Summary:** James Kemp illustrates his copy-paste content strategy, starting with email as his primary platform and then distributing the same content to other platforms like Facebook and Instagram. He emphasizes the importance of a strong origin point for the content.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** So here's an example of an email I wrote that happened to have an image of us in it. So I start with the email. I then initiate my complicated strategy of copying and pasting, and then I put that on Facebook, and then I put that on Instagram. Same thing distributed across probably more platforms, that probably went on LinkedIn as well. But the origin point is telling the story and has the characteristics that need to be in it.


##  Vulnerability in Content Creation

**Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the necessity of vulnerability in content creation, suggesting that those unwilling to share personal elements should focus on paid advertising instead.  He explains that this vulnerability is a trade-off for gaining attention and building trust.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** With content, the world has changed. People, we are in a low-trust environment, and people want to see the what, and who, and how, and the whys behind it. And to do this we need a dose of vulnerability. The dose matters for the person. My vulnerability and your vulnerability are going to differ, but at a simple level, if you are unprepared to put yourself out there, like even a tiny, tiny little bit, you have no business trying to create content. You'll be met with constant frustration and constant friction. If you are not prepared to communicate and tell stories that have some layer of personal elements in them, you're better off not even starting. If that is you, you need to focus on paid acquisition and buying customers through direct means. You need to go to the bank, spend money on Meta or Google, or one of the many other platforms, but they're the primary ones, to go and buy customers. But the skill levels required to do that are significantly more than posting and creating content. Content is the most democratized version of leverage. So if you don't want to deploy any of that, you need to go and buy attention. If you want to get attention through content, then your ideas and the life, and even the life of the people around you, are going to be subject to some level of scrutiny. This is the trade-off. In exchange for attention, we have to put ourselves out there, even a tiny, tiny, tiny little bit.


##  Authenticity and the Online Persona

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the concept of the online persona, advising against creating a drastically fictitious version of oneself. He emphasizes that sharing content closer to one's true self fosters trust and makes content creation more sustainable.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** In the world of the internet, everything is an amplification, or even a distortion, of reality. Everybody plays a character on the internet, just like everybody plays some kind of character on a group call versus a personal conversation, etc. So the art of doing this consistently is not playing too much of a character, because everybody's doing it. The person on the internet that you communicate through is a small or large synthetic version of the real you. The longer you play a character and get too far away from yourself, the harder it is to maintain. An actor can't act 24/7 without losing themselves. So if you create this massively fictitious version of you that's not real, then that is very, very hard to sustain. Ask me how I know. So the closer what you share is to the real you, the more it flows. All the things I write about are documentation of my life. It's very simple for me to create content because I'm just sharing what I do and how I do it, and all the things in between, and what happens to me and the people inside my world. So the more your content flows from you because it's you, the more people see you, and the more people trust you. People have a wonderful bullshit detector, and if they sense that you're creating this outlandish version of yourself, or you're twisting the truth too much in the form of making content, then they will not trust you, and they will not buy from you. If you choose to lean in, then you'll be richly rewarded if that is what you seek. And often people will engage with the stuff the most that you, in some cases, don't want them to engage with. I don't particularly want to call myself basically an idiot on the internet and post a slightly stupid photo. I do it because it's a great way to communicate, and I do it because it's effective. And people love it. They engage with that stuff because it is a variation of me, because that's what I am, and that's how I'd speak.


## The Power of Recency and Momentum in Content Creation

**Summary:** James Kemp advocates for capitalizing on recent insights and stories, explaining that the freshness of an idea transmits energy and resonates more effectively than reusing or repurposing older content.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** My best posts are written on the toilet, and that is a product of recency and momentum. I had a ton of calls on Tuesday, and I sat at this desk being there and present and delivering for the people I was speaking to on Tuesday. And then I got insights and ideas and those kind of things when I stepped away from that, and I jotted those down, and I'm writing about those right now. The energy of recent insights and stories always lands over a planned strategy. The freshness of an idea or a story comes through in real time. There's some kind of magic in what is in the air. Every time I reuse content, it loses a little bit of energy. So content has a half-life. It starts to degrade over time. But it's relatively short. It's, you know, down nowadays. It used to be measured in decades, and then it was measured in years, and now it's measured in months. So creating insights based on just very recent events transmits motion and movement. There's a big difference to telling a story about what happened to a client a year ago to telling a story about what happened to a client yesterday. There's some aliveness and some recency that put more weight into that content that makes it much more digestible and real, and obviously gets a lot more motion and behavior. So people follow emotion and movement. I give the example of the YouTuber, Casey Neistat. He was always moving around in his videos. He blew up because he had a character in the background, which was New York City, and then he was always moving. He was always on a booster board, he was in this office, and it had places, and he was always in motion. And things that are in motion are very easy to follow. So if you're in motion and you're doing things, and you document along the way, and you create the content as you go, you have this kind of potent essence in that content where there's something to follow, and there's something to do, and people follow along.


##  Speed to Message and Content Potency

**Summary:** James Kemp highlights the importance of quickly creating content after gaining an insight.  He explains that this speed transmits a potent energy and makes the content more compelling and alive for the audience.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** And so speed to message matters. If you give an insight or you get an insight, and then you create the content quickly off the back of that, then that content will be very, very potent. So Brad was in my house. He came here for a VIP, we spent a day writing on the, with the dogs writing on the window, putting out a plan for him for the next year. It was about 800,000, he wanted to go to a million, and he wanted to crack that number. So I documented the day, I talked about what happened, I took a couple of pictures, and I gave some insights about what plan he was undertaking, what he was doing. So when I'm reporting that in real time, it gives the content some potency and aliveness.


##  The Importance of Context in Content Creation

**Summary:** James Kemp explains that content needs a superstructure and scaffolding, emphasizing the crucial role of context.  He argues that content without context is just noise and advises inserting mechanisms, identity, and world into content to create meaning.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** Before you make content, you need a superstructure. You need some scaffolding. And what is absent in most content is context. So content that doesn't create context is just noise. And God forgive me, most of you are just creating a lot of noise because you're not actually creating context. And you just need these small elements in your content to create that context. So when we are creating content, we must insert context to move people towards our ideas. And we do this by putting in our mechanisms, the identity that we are helping people unfold, and the world that we live in, into our content. So when we link our unique mechanisms with a problem someone is currently facing, it gives them context. This is the problem that Bob was facing. This is the mechanism he used to solve that. There is a mechanism to solve that problem, and it's possessed by Ryan, or Michael, or Jared. We link our aspirational identity to a demonstration of our philosophy, and during that we create context. When people are looking at content or marketing, they tend to look forward. They don't say, "What offer am I making?" They say, "What ad do I need to run?" They don't say, "What's the context and content inside my offer?" They say, "What content do I need to create?" We need to work backwards towards the market. So we define the mechanisms we make offers with, and we create content around those mechanisms.


##  Content, Mechanisms, and Context: A Real-World Example

**Summary:**  James Kemp provides a real-world example of how he uses mechanisms to create context in his content. He discusses specific mechanisms used within his programs and how he consistently incorporates them into his content across various platforms.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** Here's a living, breathing example. Inside the syndicate, the circle, and the membership, we do three pretty simple things: we create a hybrid offer that people can buy off a Google Doc, we run workshops that we sell tickets to, and we turn those customers into clients, and we generate leads with the daily client machine. So inside our world, we do and build those things. Inside our workshops, we give more context to those things. How do you create a hybrid offer? So we show, we have a look behind the curtain. In the content that I create, I will be speaking about the mechanisms over and over again. I will be talking about the hybrid offer over and over again, and inserting it into one of my content types. I'll be talking about customers to clients, creating customers, turning them into clients, multiple times, because it's a mechanism that is effective and we use it. And I'll be talking about the daily client machine multiple times. So by just inserting those mechanisms into my content, I'm creating context within the content that I create. So if I go to Facebook right now, and I search the word "hybrid," and I look for posts from me, and I search the word "hybrid," you will see how consistently I have created context around that word, the hybrid offer. I've created it so much that everyone in the world has stolen the idea from me. I partly jest, but the nature of inserting the mechanism over and over again means that I'm generating context about that mechanism all the time. My consistency is not only in the creation of the content, but it's also on the insertion of the mechanism.


##  Mechanisms, Identity, and Market Differentiation

**Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of unique mechanisms and a clear identity as key differentiators in a commoditized market. He explains that mechanisms are the unique ways problems are solved and should be consistently highlighted in content.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** And you know, I've been shouting from the rooftops recently about competition and comparison, and what's left for people to compete on. The only thing left for you to compete on is your unique mechanisms and the ideas that you bring to the market. Everything else is commoditized. Every single other thing can be copied and replicated. But your mechanisms and your orientation towards those mechanisms, the mechanism being the way that you get results, is the thing that you can consistently do that. So we can do this after, in the workshop portion. But if we create context around our mechanisms and we insert those repeatedly, and then we have an aspirational identity – you don't even need to be that good at content and that good at communication, you just need to be consistent with the messaging – mechanisms come down to the unique way you solve problems and a clarity over who those problems are solved for, or the desires they have.


##  Content Creation Superstructure and Resources

**Summary:** James Kemp reiterates the importance of context in content and directs his audience to additional resources on mechanisms, identity, and authority within his membership and syndicate programs.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** So after we've thought about what context we want to deliver, what mechanisms we have that we want to insert into the content, by the way, if you're in the membership of the syndicate, more on mechanisms and identity and creation and authority in the classroom. So I've linked directly to that. So once we've inserted the context piece, we need to have the actual content. Like, what do we say and what do we write about?


## The Power Laws of Content and Four Content Buckets

**Summary:** James Kemp introduces the power laws of content, stating that a small percentage of content drives the majority of results. He then outlines four content buckets – philosophy, proof, problem, and plan – as tools for effective content creation.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** The power laws in content are like the power laws in anything else. 95% of the results from social and from content are driven by less than 5% of your content. I could point at literally a few dozen posts that have done more for brand and sales and audience and trust and those things than 250 other things that I've posted. So there are four simple buckets of content that can be created regularly: philosophy, proof, problem, and plan. And I want to give you these tools so you can take the tools, assemble them, and then break them apart and reassemble them because it's too simplistic to say that there's this, there's one equation that you just write about philosophy, you just write about problem, you just write a plan. The reality is that in the content, all these ideas are blended together.


## Philosophy Content: Sharing Personal Beliefs

**Summary:** James Kemp defines philosophy content as sharing personal beliefs and worldview.  He emphasizes the importance of authenticity and vulnerability in this type of content, suggesting it builds trust in a low-trust market.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** So I've got to give you examples, otherwise this is much less useful. So philosophy is what you personally believe to be true. And in the marketplace, in a low-trust marketplace, people are buying who someone is and what they believe in greater numbers than they're buying what they do, because what they do is largely commoditized. So what do you personally believe to be true? What do you believe? What do you observe? What trends are you seeing? What taste do you have? And how do you think differently about common ideas? What are the things hiding in plain sight? And what do you see that is hidden to others? And often your philosophy, in terms of the vulnerability part, has a useful requirement to say things that other people won't say. Like in this piece of content, I'm saying that if you don't do the thing that you tell other people to do, then you have a lack of congruency with what you want people to do. If you're a coach and you don't invest in coaching, there's a small lack of congruency there. If you're a fat personal trainer, you get less clients. All of these ideas are, people are observing. Basically, my philosophy is, I do what I teach and teach what I do. I've done the things that I talk about, and I do the things that I tell other people to do, and then I demonstrate them along the way. So the philosophy is basically, do what you say you're going to do and be who you say you are, and demonstrate that along the way. It's much more powerful than telling people the opposite thing. But in that case, I'm calling out an idea, being maybe mildly offensive to some people, but demonstrating in real time what I actually believe. And again, vulnerability is required. When I talk about my personal life and those things, they're through the lens of an insight and a story. And sometimes vulnerably, they're through the lens of me being me, seeing something that frustrates me and triggers me because it's something that I tolerated or compromised on in the past. So sometimes I get annoyed because I see a past version of myself and realize that it doesn't have to be like that. So I will create content that attempts to tell that story. So philosophy is you. What do you believe, and what is your worldview? To a lesser or greater extent, all of my clients share some or all of my worldview about my ideas about sovereignty and freedom and these pieces. So I share those on a regular basis because being my people is an important part of being in my world. It's very useful to believe those things. If people want to build a gigantic business with a glass building with a name on it, then I'm probably not the right guy to talk to. And so I need to be clear in my content that this is what I believe, and this is what I stand for, and this is also what I don't believe in as well.


## Proof Content: Demonstrating How Results are Achieved

**Summary:** James Kemp defines proof content as going beyond testimonials by providing insights into how clients achieved results. He stresses the importance of highlighting the mechanisms used to achieve success, making the process replicable for potential clients.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** The second type is proof, and proof is different to, say, a case study or a testimonial. It's different to a testimonial, but it's definitely my take on a case study. Proof is proving you can help someone by demonstrating how you help someone. And solid proof goes beyond testimonials. It delivers insight on how someone you worked with got a result, and mechanisms are very, very useful when you're talking about proof. So this post here, talking about how Tom made 19k in sales helping people finish their music. He joined the syndicate, so I'm inserting the product name, the thing he participated in. And then I'm talking about the mechanisms that are used to generate that 19k. Again, an example many years ago from Matt, the eight steps that he took to transform his business with a case study. I'm not saying just what the results were. I am telling people the mechanisms these people used to get the results. And that's the distinction between a typical case study. Most case studies aim to boost the credibility of the person narrating the story. I'm seeking to generate an insight to show that there's things that are accessible for people to get a result, that if you use a hybrid offer, if you use customers to clients, if you use the daily client machine, etc., that you can actually get a result behind them. So there's that. I dig deeper into more of those examples, and the actual breakdown of those and the ultimate case study template, which is again in the classroom. But essentially, at a very simple level, these are one step beyond a case study. They're not saying just what happened, they're demonstrating how it happened as well.


## Problem Content: Sharing Insights and Solutions

**Summary:** James Kemp defines problem content as sharing insights gathered from experience, offering solutions to common problems. He advocates for providing complete solutions within the content, demonstrating expertise and building trust.

**Video Source:** source: ContentCode.txt

**Content:** Problem. So this is, share an insight that you gather from delivering. The more common the problem, and the more unique your approach to solving it, the more traction these posts get. This is where a belief in giving everybody everything they need in your content is useful. I don't hold back when I tell stories that I create. I don't say, "Hey, this is a story about how to solve this problem, but to unlock the last bit, you'll need to give me money." I say exactly how to solve the problem that people are facing in content. How to attract leads that can afford you. You can click on that post, you'll see. I give people actual words and actual examples to use to reframe their lead gen so they can actually speak to people with money because they're speaking to people who've done something before

## Pricing for Mentorship

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses his pricing strategy for his mentorship program, the Syndicate, explaining how he arrived at the sweet spot of $300 per week and how this pricing allows for flexibility and optimal results for his clients.

**Video Source:** Million Dollar Mentor.txt

**Content:** The pricing sensitivity of the Syndicate was pretty high. When I started, it was $250 a week, and I slowly raised it over 19 months to $500.  Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, including considering who I enjoyed working with and their energy levels, I found the sweet spot is about $300 a week.  People paying around that price stay the longest and get the best results. They also utilize the flexibility of the model, moving up to the Circle for more intensive coaching when needed, and then returning to the Syndicate when less access is sufficient.  Going forward, I'm leading with a mentorship offer. Coaching will be limited to 24 people by invitation only.  Most people I coach will come through the mentorship offer, understand the distinction, and then decide if they want more access.

## The Power of Demonstrating in Mentorship

**Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the shift from coaching to mentorship, highlighting the benefits of demonstrating and showing clients how to achieve results, rather than solely coaching them.

**Video Source:** Million Dollar Mentor.txt

**Content:** This is the frame of the offer: our goal is building a 100k per month sovereign consulting business, 65 clients or less, and working under 3 days a week.  I will *show* you exactly how I've done it, give you my tools, and help you implement them. The promise isn't "I will coach you," but "I will show you." Mentorship requires access, so we have calls, but we're clear about what happens.  In the Syndicate, you have office hours with me Tuesdays and Thursdays, plus monthly workshops where I show you what's working for me and help you implement it.  I've removed the promise of bi-monthly workshops. Now I'll do them when it feels right and when the insights are flowing.  This is a mentorship community. I show you what's working in real time and help you implement it.  This is *not* coaching where I provide accountability, tracking, and motivation. It's on you to bring those, though there are options to get that from me to accelerate your results.

## Positioning Mentorship Against Coaching

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses the market opportunity for mentorship, explaining how to position it as a superior alternative to coaching for a specific target audience.

**Video Source:** Million Dollar Mentor.txt

**Content:** The market opportunity for positioning mentorship as better than coaching is significant. Many people have had poor experiences with online coaching—being handed off to assistants, lacking access, or experiencing a mismatch between promises and implementation.  Positioning mentorship against coaching is an easy sell.  Mentorship doesn't require the same level of investment as coaching, and it's often cheaper. Distinctions create contrast, and contrast draws attention.  My messaging is targeted at those currently doing something called coaching or who are dissatisfied with their current model and time commitments. I also target those who have achieved significant things but are repulsed by the online coaching world. Both groups are looking for a new and better opportunity.

## Recurring Revenue as a Hindsight Metric

**Summary:** James Kemp explains that recurring revenue is a metric observed in hindsight, emphasizing the importance of focusing on client momentum and dynamic offers to create a model that generates recurring revenue over time.

**Video Source:** Recurring.txt

**Content:** Recurring revenue is a mirage. It only recurs in hindsight. Many in the coaching and consulting space believe they have recurring revenue businesses, but they actually have long-duration products on payment plans. This is a crucial distinction.  The only real money is *now* money – cash in the bank. Upfront payments create a delivery liability. The 20k you accept for 12 months of work is a delivery obligation.  Smart businesses balance assets and liabilities. Clients are assets, and we generate yield by delivering agreed value. To grow revenue, we grow the asset: increase clients, client value, or client lifetime.  My definition of recurring revenue is revenue that showed up in the past. I'll show you revenue that has recurred. I'll take you into the future so you can build a model that generates recurring revenue when you look back.

## The Power of Weekly Pricing

**Summary:** James Kemp advocates for weekly pricing over monthly, highlighting its benefits in terms of increased sales, higher annual revenue, client flexibility, and reduced churn.

**Video Source:** Recurring.txt

**Content:** I've found weekly pricing superior to monthly. Objectively, it has a lower "now" number, increasing sales. It generates 8.5% more annually due to 13 four-week blocks in a year. Subjectively, it's more dynamic. Clients feel more flexibility with adding/removing products and payments. It's simpler to upsell, downsell, and minimize churn as investment decisions are more immediate. I cut churn by 80% when I implemented a community level at a lower price, as people downgraded rather than left completely.

## The Simple-Complex Stack for Recurring Revenue

**Summary:** James Kemp introduces the simple-complex stack, a strategy for creating a series of offers that address the increasing complexity clients experience as they implement simple initial promises, ensuring continued client engagement and recurring revenue.

**Video Source:** Recurring.txt

**Content:**  If we make things simple for clients, our offer is simple to sell. But even simple processes are individually complex.  I make it simple to create a $3,000 offer. The complexity comes in the execution. Some people sell immediately, others take months. We take people through a simple-complex axis.  Simple: "I'll create a $3,000 offer with you."  Complex: "How do I sell it?" Simple: "I'll create it for you (Fastlane)." Complex: "It's hard to make $3k/week consistently." Simple: "Join the Syndicate, I'll tell you exactly what to do." This chain is theoretically infinite. Over time, this axis can continually be sold to an individual client.  Making your offer simple, while appreciating the client's experience of complexity, allows for a natural next offer.

## The Social Code: Delivering Insight

**Summary:** James Kemp emphasizes the importance of delivering insight on social media, differentiating it from readily available information and highlighting its value in attracting and engaging an audience.

**Content:** You must deliver insight because insight is extremely rare, and rare things are valuable. Information allows us to observe what is happening, but insights tell us *why*. If you can demonstrate why something is happening in someone's life, you demonstrate a deeper understanding that others seek.  People are seeking a deeper understanding of why things happen to them. Insight starts to piece together why something’s happening through real experience.

## The Social Code: Selling Ideas

**Summary:** James Kemp explains that social media is best used for selling ideas, not products, as this builds buy-in and makes selling products easier later on.

**Content:** Before someone can buy something, they need to buy *into* something – an idea.  If you sell people on your ideas on social, it’s much easier to sell them on you and your products. The sequence is always idea first, then product. Approach social media as an idea salesperson.  Don't make direct offers. It’s clunky and induces fatigue. Use social content to move people to social messaging or email.

## The Social Code: Plan Posts for Leadership

**Summary:**  James Kemp explains that plan posts, which outline a clear direction and strategy, are the most powerful type of social media content for establishing leadership and attracting a following.

**Content:** In a chaotic world, everyone wants a plan. To get followers, you need to lead. To establish leadership, decide on a direction, define it, and lead others towards it. This content blends philosophy, proof, and problem.  Plans require courage. They work well as pillar content because they’re risky. Setting your stall out is the single biggest movement of attention you can make. This content can be repurposed and referred back to.  On July 18th, I posted my plan to get back to $3 million a year. I detailed the steps, and people were curious and started following along. Eight weeks later, I updated them on my progress. These posts create a viral loop.  Setting a plan is powerful for attracting a following and for self-accountability. It sets you on a journey.

## The Social Code: Moving from Public to Private

**Summary:** James Kemp discusses strategies for moving people from public social media feeds to private messaging or email, where direct offers can be made more effectively.

**Content:**  Attraction takes time. Direct asks move people to the next stage.  Two-step posts get people to respond, then you send a DM. Examples: "Recorded a loom on selling 60k hybrid offers with a Google Doc. Want the private link?" or "Finally doing a workshop on my social media strategy. DM for the link."  Be explicit – ask for comments, then DM.  I've evolved this into "insight two-steps." They ask for a comment, but I treat them like sales letters. Example: "Three steps to selling high-ticket with a three-page doc. Since July, 90 people signed up, paying 10k-75k/year. I did it with a Google Doc. Promise: new money, expand LTV. Workshop: [details]. DM for link."  This is a sales page with insight.  Sell up to the line, but make the sale via DM.

## The Sovereign Consultant: Prioritizing Life Over Business

**Summary:** James Kemp introduces the Sovereign Consultant model, emphasizing the importance of building a life that a business feeds, rather than the other way around, and prioritizing intentional inputs and leverage.

**Content:** The Sovereign Consultant model is about building a life that a business feeds.  Most people want a good life, and the cash flow, impact, and meaning a business provides can feed that life.  It's easy to stay at the surface level of strategy, but tactics and strategies alone are volatile and exhausting. Principles and philosophy guide strategy and lower volatility.  My calendar demonstrates what's important to me: daily exercise, date night, family dinner, client group calls, and calls only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This creates space for creativity and flow.  You don't earn the right to free space; you choose it.  Intentional time management dictates results.  The Sovereign way is about leverage and serving the maximum number of people.

## The Sovereign Consultant: Building a Brand

**Summary:** James Kemp outlines a three-step process for building a strong brand: defining and selling a unique mechanism, crafting an aspirational identity, and building a world around your brand.

**Video Source:** Sovereign Consultant.txt

**Content:** A brand is what people say about you when you're not there.  The ideal brand does all the selling.  Three components: world, identity, and mechanisms.  Start with the mechanism – the way you get results. It needs to be unique (yours) and work. Examples: Daily Client Machine (lead magnet with a self-liquidating offer), Customers to Clients (low-ticket workshops with an offer), Hybrid Offer (selling via documents).  Next, craft an aspirational identity. What does someone become when they commit to your world?  JK's "Cash Creators" is a great example.  Finally, world-building. People buy who you are more than what you do.  World-building is an abstraction of your reality.  Components: characters, language, places, storylines, memes.  My world: The Brazilian, Mr. 13, Miss 7, the cat, the dog, Bali, my journey back to $3 million.  Have fun with it (oat milk, Atomic Habits).
