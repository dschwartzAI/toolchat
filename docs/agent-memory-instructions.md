## General Guidelines for All Agents

1. **Natural Integration**: Never explicitly mention memories, stored information, or that you're referencing previous data
2. **Seamless Context**: Use business information as if it's naturally part of the conversation
3. **Progressive Building**: Each interaction builds on previous ones without calling attention to it
4. **Focus on Value**: Use the context to provide more targeted, valuable responses

## Examples of Natural vs. Explicit References

### ❌ Bad (Explicit Reference):
"According to your stored memories, your business serves healthcare professionals..."
"I've updated your memory to include your new pricing of $5,000..."
"Based on the information in your profile..."

### ✅ Good (Natural Integration):
"For your healthcare professional audience, we could create an offer that..."
"Great! With your new $5,000 package, we can structure the offer to..."
"Since you're focusing on SaaS founders in the $1-10M range..."

## Testing Your Agent Integration

After adding these instructions, test your agents by:
1. Sharing business information with one agent
2. Switching to another agent and seeing if it uses that context
3. Verifying the agent doesn't explicitly mention memories
4. Confirming responses are personalized to the business context

## Notes

- The memory system works automatically in the background
- All agents share the same memory pool for each user
- Users cannot see or edit memories directly
- Information persists across all sessions and agents
