Project Overview
Build a comprehensive document processing pipeline to prepare James Kemp's business knowledge base for optimal RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) performance in the DarkJK coaching tool.
Objective
Create a Python script that processes 20+ diverse documents (PDFs, text files, video transcripts) into a well-structured, searchable vector store with intelligent chunking, rich metadata, and semantic organization.
Core Requirements
1. Input Handling

Accept a directory path containing all knowledge base files
It's located in the JK Knowledge folder which should be in the jk-ai root directory
Support multiple file formats: .pdf, .txt, .md, .docx, .json
Process all files in batch without manual intervention
Generate processing logs and error reports

2. Document Processing Pipeline
Stage 1: Document Loading
python# Pseudocode structure
for file in directory:
    - Detect file type
    - Extract raw text while preserving structure
    - Identify document type (book, transcript, framework doc, etc.)
    - Extract basic metadata (title, author, creation date)
Stage 2: Content Analysis & Classification

Books/Long-form Content: Detect chapters, sections, subsections
Video Transcripts: Identify speakers, topics, natural breaks
Framework Documents: Extract framework names, components, use cases
Course Materials: Identify modules, lessons, exercises

Stage 3: Intelligent Chunking Strategy
pythonchunking_rules = {
    "book": {
        "max_tokens": 1200,
        "min_tokens": 400,
        "overlap": 150,
        "split_on": ["chapter", "section", "###", "##"]
    },
    "transcript": {
        "max_tokens": 800,
        "min_tokens": 300,
        "overlap": 100,
        "split_on": ["speaker_change", "topic_shift", "timestamp"]
    },
    "framework": {
        "max_tokens": 600,
        "min_tokens": 200,
        "overlap": 50,
        "split_on": ["framework_component", "example", "use_case"]
    }
}
3. Metadata Enrichment
Each chunk should include:
json{
    "chunk_id": "unique_identifier",
    "text": "chunk content...",
    "metadata": {
        "source_file": "filename.pdf",
        "document_type": "book|transcript|framework",
        "title": "The Sovereign Consultant",
        "chapter": "7: Building Leverage",
        "section": "The 3 E's Framework",
        "page_number": 142,
        "keywords": ["extracted", "keywords"],
        "entities": ["James Kemp", "3 E's", "Energy"],
        "concept_category": "framework|strategy|tactic|mindset",
        "related_concepts": ["leverage", "business evaluation"],
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15",
        "chunk_index": 5,
        "total_chunks_in_section": 12
    }
}
4. Special Processing Rules
Framework Extraction
When detecting frameworks (like "3 E's"), create:

Complete chunk: Full explanation in one chunk
Component chunks: Individual components (Energy, Earnings, Experience)
Summary chunk: Brief overview for quick reference
Application chunk: How to use the framework

Cross-Referencing

Link related concepts across documents
Create concept maps (e.g., "3 E's" → "Leverage" → "Business Design")
Tag prerequisites and follow-up concepts

Video Transcript Cleaning

Remove filler words ("um", "uh", "you know")
Consolidate repeated ideas
Add topic headers based on content
Preserve important quotes verbatim

5. Vector Store Integration
Embedding Strategy

Use OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 or similar
Create embeddings for:

Full chunks
Chunk summaries
Metadata keywords
Concept descriptions



Storage Structure
pythonvector_store_schema = {
    "collections": [
        "full_content",      # Complete chunks
        "summaries",         # Condensed versions
        "frameworks",        # Isolated frameworks
        "examples",          # Case studies and examples
        "definitions"        # Key term definitions
    ]
}
6. Quality Assurance
Validation Checks

Ensure no critical content is split (frameworks, key concepts)
Verify metadata completeness
Check for orphaned chunks
Validate cross-references

Test Queries
pythontest_suite = [
    "What are the 3 E's?",
    "Energy Earnings Experience",
    "How to build leverage",
    "Hybrid offer structure",
    "Workshop frameworks",
    "Client transformation"
]
7. Output Requirements
Primary Outputs

Processed vector database ready for integration
Metadata index (JSON) for quick lookups
Processing report with statistics and issues
Concept map showing relationships

8. Implementation Tools
Recommended libraries:

Document parsing: unstructured, pypdf, python-docx
Text processing: langchain, llama-index, spacy
Embeddings: openai, sentence-transformers
Vector store: chromadb, pinecone, weaviate
Utilities: tiktoken (token counting), tqdm (progress bars)

9. Error Handling

Graceful handling of corrupted files
Fallback strategies for parsing failures
Detailed error logging with context
Option to reprocess failed files

10. Performance Considerations

Process files in parallel where possible
Implement caching for repeated operations
Batch embedding requests
Progress indicators for long operations
