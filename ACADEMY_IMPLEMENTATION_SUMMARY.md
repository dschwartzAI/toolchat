- **Community Tab**: Access the discussion forum

### 2. **Direct Routes** (when clicked from sidebar)
- `/academy` - Main Academy dashboard
- `/academy/courses/:courseId` - View specific course
- `/academy/courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId` - View specific lesson
- `/academy/forum` - Community forum
- `/academy/admin` - Admin dashboard (admin users only)

## Current State

### Mock Data
The implementation currently uses mock data to demonstrate functionality:
- 2 sample courses with modules and lessons
- Sample forum posts and categories
- Mock user enrollments and progress

### Dependencies Not Yet Installed
To enable full functionality, these packages need to be installed:
```bash
npm install socket.io-client @hello-pangea/dnd
```

For now, mock implementations are in place at:
- `/client/src/mocks/socket.io-client.ts`
- `/client/src/mocks/hello-pangea-dnd.tsx`

## Navigation Flow

1. **Click Academy icon** in left sidebar → Opens Academy panel
2. **Browse courses** → Click course card → Opens course in main area
3. **Select lesson** → Video player or text content loads
4. **Switch to Community tab** → Access forum discussions
5. **Admin users** → Can access course management via Academy routes

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Seamless Integration**: Academy appears as a natural part of LibreChat
2. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for courses and lessons
3. **Multi-format Content**: Support for video and text lessons
4. **Community Features**: Forum with categories and discussions
5. **Admin Tools**: Complete course management interface
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
7. **Real-time Updates**: Socket.io integration (mocked)

## Next Steps

1. Install actual dependencies
2. Connect to real backend API endpoints
3. Implement actual file uploads for course thumbnails
4. Add video upload/processing
5. Enable real-time forum updates
6. Add course enrollment payment integration
